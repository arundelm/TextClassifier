  content = i didnt realize thered be no more office hours can a staff please take a look at my project 4 player simple test and let me know what i got wrong i know i forgot to delete one of the players so thered be memory leak but i didnt think id lose that much points just for that thanks

  correct = student, predicted = student, log-probability score = -99.8
  content = i was told that the answer is none because the line of code is not in a cout however the instructions say write the output i thought output implied a cout stream since that is how it is written in our project specs why is that not valid here

  correct = student, predicted = student, log-probability score = -126
  content = hey in looking over the exam solutions im curious to what popback was meant to do i asdumed it would pop the lastand only element on mylist and then the integer would not be leaked according to the solutions im guessing that is wrong just curious

  correct = student, predicted = student, log-probability score = -83.7
  content = if an error derived class is thrown and theres no catch for it is it caught by the base class error assuming there is one also what happens if there isnt any catch corresponding to a throw

  correct = student, predicted = student, log-probability score = -171
  content = so after 58 is thrown it is caught by the other catch for derivedint in the bar function right this dereferences the int and then throws a string i dont get what happens after that i know it starts looking for catch functions on a larger scope also in general is it possible for a throw to refer to catches in another function if its being called by this other function

  correct = student, predicted = student, log-probability score = -8.74

  correct = student, predicted = instructor, log-probability score = -204
  content = in the final review lecture someone asked a question about deleting virtual from a virtual function in the derived class but not the base class i was a little confused by the instructors answer if a function is declared virtual or pure virtual in the base class it will always be virtual in all of the derived classes regardless of if the derived class has the function declared as virtual void speak or void speak for example if a was the base class with a pure virtual function called hello and b was a derived class hello would also be virtual their regardless of if the world virtual was written out or not what if a class c was a derived class of class b if hello was also written their but the virtual keyword was missing from the b class definition of hello would class cs hello also be virtual sorry if this is confusing

  correct = student, predicted = student, log-probability score = -62.9
  content = why does this cause a compiler error it is creating a new object of a type theres b b in main but the compiler doesnt give any errors for that

  correct = student, predicted = student, log-probability score = -49
  content = why does line three call the copy constructor only it pretty clearly uses the assignment operator

  correct = student, predicted = student, log-probability score = -43.1
  content = the receiver of basevirt3 is actually a derived object how can it work thanks

  correct = student, predicted = student, log-probability score = -149
  content = in the solutions you say that we must check if prev and next 2 are nonnull or not however in the main if loop youve assigned next2 to be equal to next of next before checking if it exists or not cant this potentially lead to a seg fault or something if say the node input is the first node or the second last node in the list

  correct = student, predicted = student, log-probability score = -101
  content = in past exam spring 2015 the iterator calls the function by itupdatedistance but can i just do itupdatedistance i wanted to make sure since if the answer said it instead of simply writing it there must be a reason for that

  correct = student, predicted = instructor, log-probability score = -53.3
  content = hi i was wondering if we could use a for loop for 2a on the fall final exam instead of the while loop

  correct = student, predicted = student, log-probability score = -35.2
  content = can someone distinguish them i always think they are the same things

  correct = student, predicted = student, log-probability score = -13.3
  content = what is the difference between the two

  correct = student, predicted = student, log-probability score = -84.4
  content = on 5a i dont understand why 123 is being printed where does a cout for a deriveddouble get called in the sequence of main or is a cout somehow implicitly called

  correct = student, predicted = student, log-probability score = -43
  content = confused as to why certain elements of bobby are deleted off of the heap

  correct = student, predicted = student, log-probability score = -136
  content = when is best to use a while loop vs iterator loop vs node ptr loop do you have to declare a template if before hand if you use an iterator loop or are you allowed to call a adt object if you know the list is going to consist of it i understand there are certain cases where you they are interchangable but is there general rule

  correct = student, predicted = student, log-probability score = -179
  content = imagine we have 3 classes base derived1 derived such that derived2 is a derived1 and derived1 is a base now lets say all 3 of them have a function f1 which is nonvirtual in base but virtual in both derived1 and derived2 its clear that if a derived1 object calls f1 it would run the base version of f1 because the function isnt virtual in base however if a derived2 object called f1 would it be virtual since derived2s direct parent class implements a virtual version of this function

  correct = student, predicted = student, log-probability score = -96.1
  content = in the solution to the defend castle black function it appears the first argument may be missing in the for loop is this argument missing or is the initialization argument supposed to be blank because initialization occurred outside of the for loop thanks

  content = crab challenge

  correct = student, predicted = student, log-probability score = -79.1
  content = the destructor frees up the space but not deletes the object but if the space is already freed up you dont have any space to store the object then its the same effect of deleting object

  correct = student, predicted = student, log-probability score = -41.8
  content = can i not just change the datum i just changed datum of the node with the datum of the next node is there any problem if i do so

  correct = student, predicted = instructor, log-probability score = -181
  content = how much time should we devote to going over the advanced generic programming lecture material there was only one lecture on it and the practice exams did not have anything remotely related to it the professors stated in the beginning of the course this is class is not about learning c syntax but rather how to be a better at solving problems so im not sure how important knowing the material on the the advanced programming lecture will be for the final exam

  correct = student, predicted = student, log-probability score = -85.6
  content = why do you print leaving main after f is thrown at the bottom of catch baseint in foo why doset that get caught

  correct = student, predicted = student, log-probability score = -75.4
  content = isnt scheduleend equal to an empty iterator when putting it into scheduleinsertinsertit m doesnt it result in an error because youre passing in an empty iterator

  correct = student, predicted = instructor, log-probability score = -105
  content = after watching the video for review 4 im still a little confused for 1 the code was fixed by changing delete ptr to delete ptr wouldnt this delete the entire array rather than just the last element of the array is it possible to delete only the last element

  correct = student, predicted = instructor, log-probability score = -97.7
  content = i noticed in the first problem it asks questions about static variables and i dont really understand the answers i dont remember talking much about static types in lecture just not to use them should i be concerned or will it not be on the exam

  correct = student, predicted = student, log-probability score = -61.5
  content = so it says that it is different then project 5 was project 5 different for the fall class or do they mean because they are not using iterators or am i missing something

  correct = student, predicted = student, log-probability score = -26.2
  content = do we have to assert to check for the requires clause in the exam

  correct = student, predicted = student, log-probability score = -35.8

  content = although this has been explained a couple of times i still do not understand when we need to have typename and when we dont

  correct = student, predicted = student, log-probability score = -120
  content = could someone explain why when using iterators in project 4 and in other situations we needed to use typename listtiterator it instead of just iterator it does it just tell the compiler what the iterator will be iterating over does it create a specific type of iterator that works with lists of type t

  correct = student, predicted = student, log-probability score = -33.5
  content = in this slide from the lecture on functors the function name is passed in the function pointer

  correct = student, predicted = student, log-probability score = -212
  content = im confused is to why im a ninja llama doesnt get executed when a printdescription is called on a supper llama pointer that is actually pointing to a ninja llama im assuming it gets over written with the version in superllama why does it exist in the subclass then if it enters the version in the subclass then it should also cout that in the answers i guess im missing a property of polymorphism where the super class functions always override the subclass ones with the same signature

  correct = student, predicted = student, log-probability score = -193
  content = hi in the superllama class method printdescription has no virtual keyword yet in the derived ninjallama class printdescription is a virtual function i couldnt find anything in lecture that gave explicit help to this particular situation so i was wondering a few things what does it mean to have a derived class virtual function with the same nameparameters as a base class nonvirtual function why would anyone do such a thing and how does this behave when called

  correct = student, predicted = student, log-probability score = -66.3
  content = for the answer could we do void doublylinkedlistremoveiflessint threshold for node n first n 0 n n next if n datum threshold removenoden

  correct = student, predicted = student, log-probability score = -109
  content = so variables in static storage are created at the start of the program locals are created when their scope starts does the compiler preallocate space for all these unlike dynamically allocated data

  correct = student, predicted = student, log-probability score = -113
  content = a cout a dtor n b cout b dtor n a ab new b delete ab yesterday vidal said this would print out a dtor because ab is a base class pointer im wondering what would print if we had done something like this a cout a dtor n virtual b cout b dtor n b ab new b delete ab im guessing b dtor would print but would a dtor print as well

  correct = student, predicted = student, log-probability score = -38.3

  correct = student, predicted = student, log-probability score = -74.3
  content = in a class if some are the functions are pure virtual and others have actual implementations does that mean we can still instantiate objects of the type of the base class

  correct = student, predicted = student, log-probability score = -113
  content = in question 3s definition of class whitewalker it doesnt say private anywhere it just lists the member variables then is says public so if the word private isnt included does that make the variables above the public section private public or neither thanks in advance

  correct = student, predicted = student, log-probability score = -46.7
  content = i understand whoopingllama destructor does not have to be virtual but will it cause any problem if we make it virtual

  correct = student, predicted = student, log-probability score = -30.2
  content = shouldnt it be typename listwhitewalkeriterator it armybegin

  correct = student, predicted = student, log-probability score = -130
  content = from problem 4 of the spring exam i noticed in printdescription for ninjallama it calls superllamaprintdescription if printdescription in superllama was written as a virtual function would superllamaprintdescription call the printdescription from superllama is calling basefunction in a derived class a way of running the version of the function from the base class even if a virtual function was used

  correct = student, predicted = student, log-probability score = -124
  content = in question 4a f15 the value into the function call operator is passed by reference do we have to write these overrides with reference to avoid making copies all the time i think the function also works without passing by reference is there a way to know for sure which one to use

  correct = student, predicted = student, log-probability score = -87.9
  content = after looking through a lot of lecture and example material im still kind of confused as to when we use semicolons after declarationdefinition of classes could anyone clear this up thanks

  correct = student, predicted = student, log-probability score = -170
  content = even though s1 and s2 contains pointers to the same array would the output for cout s1 still not be 2 3 insert in s2 does not affect the size and capacity of s1 so assuming that overload only prints unto the first letssize elements would that not make any difference ps this is the last slide from lecture 17

  correct = student, predicted = student, log-probability score = -127
  content = hi so i lost a lot of points on project 5 for some reason my code passed all of the compilation tests when i submitted it to the autograder and it compiles for some tests but for many of the list tests that are returning in the grade breakdown it says the code simply didnt compile any ideas how the code passed the compilation test and some of the list tests but not others

  correct = student, predicted = student, log-probability score = -96.7
  content = i received the break down email and just want to make sure that the no student test case means my test cases are not graded yet doesnt mean i didnt submit them right i did submit and have them passed the autograder

  correct = student, predicted = student, log-probability score = -41.2
  content = why is this compile i thought this will occur some problems in value semantics

  correct = student, predicted = student, log-probability score = -32.3
  content = actually how to make a pointer point to a pointer that points to the first element of an array

  correct = student, predicted = student, log-probability score = -156
  content = all elements in the array are on the heap since the elements are dynamically allocated regardless of their type the ints those pointers point to are indeed not deleted but thats not asked by the question the question is you cant delete an array of dynamically allocated pointers at once is the following syntax right if so by deleting arr we can delete all pointers on the heap int arr new int3 delete arr

  correct = student, predicted = student, log-probability score = -115
  content = if the subtype indeed has weaker or equal requires stronger or equal effects can it make fewer modifications than base class what if the user is expecting the modification thats missing in subtype class thanks

  content = how does a string type create a memory leak

  correct = student, predicted = instructor, log-probability score = -151
  content = so although my partner and i received perfect scores on the autograder when submitted and the make file compiled perfectly we ended up doing pretty poorly on project 4 and 5 my partner and i are extremely frustrated we also dont understand what the no student test cases statement means in the ctools grade

  correct = student, predicted = instructor, log-probability score = -66.1
  content = im confused as to how the answer to 5c was achieved in spring 2015 wouldnt choice a work better

  correct = student, predicted = instructor, log-probability score = -224
  content = what does stronger postcondition actually mean for example in the final exam fall 2015 question 3 lobsters pinch reduces object width by 2 while crustaceans pinch reduces object width by 1 does the stronger postcondition mean the magnitude of change is bigger in lobsters pinch if the lobsters pinch reduced object width by 05 would it mean that lobster has weaken postcondition also lobster greets with lobster hi while crustacean greets with hi does that mean lobsters greet has stronger postcondition because it prints out more things

  correct = student, predicted = student, log-probability score = -0.0306
  content = 

  correct = student, predicted = student, log-probability score = -85.6
  content = does a regular pointer such as int have dynamic type also if a pointer to a base class never points to an object of its derived class does it still have a dynamic type bird bptr bird thanks

  correct = student, predicted = student, log-probability score = -208
  content = for example we have a class base and a class derived which is derived from base were taught that when creating a derived object the base ctor will run first and then the derived ctor my question is is this behavior absolute or does it depend on the implementation class derived public base derivedstring namein basenamein string name like seen above is the top down behavior due to how the derived class delegates a base constructor if we did not delegate the base constructor would the rule still apply

  correct = student, predicted = student, log-probability score = -36.2
  content = what percent of the project 4 grade are the student card and player tests

  correct = student, predicted = student, log-probability score = -113
  content = is it possible to release the test cases used in the autograder for projects that are finishedbasically all by now i just want to check where and why my project programs go wrong in the autograder so that in the future i can fix bugs i couldnt catch

  correct = student, predicted = student, log-probability score = -63.3
  content = the answer key keeps doing for int i 0 i numparts i delete partsi does just doing delete parts not work

  correct = student, predicted = student, log-probability score = -64.1
  content = they both involve failure to delete unused dynamically allocated data whats the key difference thanks

  correct = student, predicted = instructor, log-probability score = -71.4
  content = on ctools the grade given for my project 5 autograder is 16 points lower than my actual autograder scoreout of 95 what is the reason for this

  correct = student, predicted = instructor, log-probability score = -135
  content = i just checked my gradebook on c tools and i see that scores have been posted for projects 4 and 5 and im wondering if these grades final and can i ask any gsi professor or anybody about them im very confused and concerned as is my partner for these projects especially regarding the euchre project

  correct = student, predicted = student, log-probability score = -109
  content = can anyone explain why the destructor needs to be virtual the output shows that the dynamic type whooping llama dtor was called first and then the static type super llama is it that you need to put virtual so that it runs both

  correct = student, predicted = student, log-probability score = -78.2

  content = i am reviewing lab 11 task 4 and i am confused about what iterators are invalidated by the destructor and assignment operator on list both functions definitely invalidate all nonend iterators except for self assignment also iterators of rhs are untouched however i am not sure whether the end iterators are invalidated in the case of the destructor the end iterator still contains a null pointer after the destructor executes so it seems valid however calling it valid seems strange because it refers to a dead object for an end iterator with the assignment operator it seems like it should remain valid because it will still contain a null pointer do both functions leave end iterators valid

  content = im a little confused with the specifications it says stack after seeing operator 23 but wouldnt that take up two spaces on the stack if it was a stack of ints or should our stack be a stack of rationals where every single number is just a number with a denominator of 1

  correct = student, predicted = student, log-probability score = -45.6
  content = im a little confused the specs say do not use other libraries but do include a library to use its functions

  correct = student, predicted = student, log-probability score = -77.9

  correct = student, predicted = student, log-probability score = -170
  content = it says that inputs can be separated by whitespace including a newline does this include the escape code n or just new line in the sense of a user hitting enter or an input file having a line break ie if i were to input 0 1 5 2 n n 5 6 2 into the terminal should i account for that or would only accounting for 0 1 5 2 n enter 5 6 2 suffice

  content = im still confused on how to deal with input for calc in calctest00in is 2 3 4 3 3 4 5 2 m entered as a single string that we have to go through to extract each char and perform whatever necessary action on each one after the entire string has been entered or will the program take in the 2 using cin then ask for another char where the user enters 3 and so on and so on so is each line in calctest00in a single account of user input so there would be 10 total commands

  content = the corrections sheet on google drive says the slides for lecture 21 ­ iterators slide 14 and lecture 22 ­ functors slide 7 contained a mistake which is relevant to project 5 because name lookup for the return type of a member function is not performed in the scope of the class just using the unqualified name iterator is insufficient instead the return type must use the qualified name listtiterator additionally because listtiterator is a dependent name the typename keyword must be used see the appendix in the p5 specification does this mean we have to change all of the functions in listh that have a return type of iterator for example would we change these iterator operator iterator iterator iterator begin const to these typename listtiterator operator typename listtiterator iterator typename listtiterator begin const also the lecture 21 slide 14 has the line typename listtiterator listtiteratoroperator why is this repeated twice

  correct = student, predicted = student, log-probability score = -59.7
  content = when i run valgrind for a leak check what does suppressed mean for example when i run listcompilecheck i get this output it says suppressed 1 from 1 does this mean it suppressed a memory leak or

  correct = student, predicted = student, log-probability score = -127
  content = the only variable that would need to be constructed is the list yet since list has its own constructor wouldnt we not need to create a default constructor for stack i see the necessity for copy and equals functions part of the big three in use but i do not see the relevancy of a constructor am i correct here

  correct = student, predicted = student, log-probability score = -202
  content = when i run the lists compiler check i get an error that i have a double free i know the source of the problem and ive narrowed it down within listcompilecheck it seems that when it runs iter mylistbegin just before it calls erase for the first time it is somehow adding an addition node to my list that contains the datum 0 i have not changed begin whatsoever so i dont know how this is even possible ive been working on this for hours

  content = in this scenario help has been set equal to otherfirst or the first element of a list id like to copy why may this end up uninitialized i understand that help may 0 and not have a next element but this statement itself is in a while loop that requires that help is not 0 so if temp is declared it must be initialized

  correct = student, predicted = student, log-probability score = -92.3
  content = this function should be returning a iterator to one past the end aka node pointer is a null pointer how do we assert that what this function returns a iterator that has a null pointer we cant access nodeptr because it is private and we cant deference anything because the pointer is null

  correct = student, predicted = student, log-probability score = -200
  content = in the list tests if listh is not implemented correctly like what our test cases are supposed to catch there are many scenarios where the list tests may try to run a function from listh that ends up trying to dereference a null ptr which can crash the program if the program crashes in this way does that count as our test catching athe bug if not will the buggy code fed to our tests check the requires clauses of functions with an assert statement

  correct = student, predicted = student, log-probability score = -154
  content = whenever we run stackpublictests the program runs for about 30 seconds then says that the program was killed this happens in the public tests after calling the copy constructor we thought that this could be due to an infinite loop but there are no loops present in this portion of the code any ideas thank you

  correct = student, predicted = student, log-probability score = -107
  content = if you try to use erase to delete the first node you do not have access to the first pointer in list therefore the first pointer will be pointing to something that doesnt exist anymore are we just assuming that is okay obviously that is bad but are we just assuming you dont try to delete the first node so that the list doesnt break

  correct = student, predicted = student, log-probability score = -172
  content = are we supposed to check the invariants in the rectangle constructor or in the getnumeratordenominator functions if we check them in the constructors then that would mean we wouldnt be using member initialization with the symbol like rectangle numeratorx denominatory and instead we would have to do all the initialization in the brackets so rectangle numerator x denominator y after we check the invariants is this fine i thought we only learned to use the member initialization form for constructors

  correct = student, predicted = instructor, log-probability score = -95.1
  content = are we allowed to use break and continue in out for and while loops i did not see anything about in the style guidelines but it was considered bad style in the previous computer science classes i took

  correct = student, predicted = student, log-probability score = -147
  content = hi in the last line of listcompilecheck the iterator iter is decremented i know that my previous code results in iter pointing to the second element of mylist by changing what was pushedback in mylist and then outputting iter but for some reason when iter is decremented a seg fault occurs any ideas on why this is happening thanks

  correct = student, predicted = student, log-probability score = -63
  content = when i return by reference i want my variable to not go out of scope is there anyway to do this in stack without making a dynamic type

  correct = student, predicted = student, log-probability score = -108
  content = in this countif function i used while iter but when iterator points to the end it gets into operator function and makes an error so i tried to use just while iter and compiler said listtiterator is illegal can anyone tell me why and how to solve this

  correct = student, predicted = student, log-probability score = -144
  content = in the calculator if we print the stack from top to bottom am i right in saying that the rationals will be printed in the reverse order that they were created and if so isnt that confusing to the user ex if i type in 4 3 i get 43 but if i type in 4 3 a then i get 3 4 so i may suspect from calling a that when i use i will get 34

  correct = student, predicted = student, log-probability score = -220

  correct = student, predicted = student, log-probability score = -146
  content = hi quick question the autograder doesnt test each individual overloaded functionoperator with its own implementation of a rational object right it uses ours that is defined in our cpp file correct i just want to make sure because im doing the majority of the simplification work in my rational constructor thanks

  correct = student, predicted = student, log-probability score = -143
  content = when i try to compile my code i get the following error error prototype for ‘int stacktcountifpredicate const’ does not match any in class ‘stackt’ int stacktcountifpredicate pred const my code is below i am not sure if i am misunderstanding how to write the implementation for this function is there something i am missing template typename ttypename predicate int stacktcountifpredicate pred const

  correct = student, predicted = student, log-probability score = -20
  content = why is there a typename before the return type

  correct = student, predicted = student, log-probability score = -145
  content = in project 3 we have functions like void matrixinit as constructors for structs is that the only form of struct constructor 1 can structs have constructors that are like class constructors have the same name as the class and no return type such as matrix 2 can structs have initializing list matrixint sizein sizesizein besides can we add constructor for node in project 5 thanks

  correct = student, predicted = student, log-probability score = -34.9
  content = if t is an int then this function will return an int value correct or does it return an address

  correct = student, predicted = student, log-probability score = -41.8

  correct = student, predicted = student, log-probability score = -79.9
  content = in calccpp how do you know what input file to read in in my calccpp i have a ifstream that reads in the file that is inputted however how does the program know what file to take in is the input file typed into the terminal and then the program must read in the input file

  correct = student, predicted = student, log-probability score = -67.2
  content = the rme for copyall says to copy the data from the input list to this list should we just add this other lists data to the end of our list or overwrite our current list

  correct = student, predicted = student, log-probability score = -104
  content = i added in a private member variable to the list class to keep track of the size is this allowed i know in the specs it said not to modify the public interface but it didnt say anything about the private interface were allowed to add private member functions so i assume we can add private member variables

  correct = student, predicted = student, log-probability score = -146
  content = intuitively operator should be able to move back from past the end of the list with an iterator given by end but the code we were provided with will fail if nodeptr is null and i cant find anything about it in the spec am i missing something or are we just not supposed to ever bring an iterator back from beyond the edge of the list

  correct = student, predicted = student, log-probability score = -85.8
  content = in the leak summary for stacktests 168 bytes in 7 blocks are coming up as still reachable nothing is lost would this be okay

  correct = student, predicted = student, log-probability score = -68.5
  content = i just spotted a leak in my code but valgrind did not give any error is this possible or am ibdoing a double free

  correct = student, predicted = student, log-probability score = -47.7
  content = im getting an error in the listh file thats saying this and im not quite sure what to do since its what im given

  correct = student, predicted = student, log-probability score = -111
  content = in the listcompilecheck there is a line that says cout iter endl this line seems to want me to write an extraction overload for the node struct however i cannot figure out where to do this or how to properly access the private node member of the class

  correct = student, predicted = student, log-probability score = -84.3
  content = for the countif function there is only one parameter for template can i just put one more parameter like templatetypename t typename predicate or how can i implement that function outside of the class and how can i declare iterator

  correct = student, predicted = student, log-probability score = -223
  content = hello everyone my partner and i are getting a fairly strange error trying to compile list we have looked through our code and cannot locate the source of the problem g prints out the following error tmpcchyjusxolistcompilecheckcpptext0x91 undefined reference to listintcopyalllistint const tmpcchyjusxolistcompilecheckcpptext0x91 relocation truncated to fit rx8664pc32 against undefined symbol listintcopyalllistint const tmpcchyjusxolistcompilecheckcpptext0xab undefined reference to listintcopyalllistint const tmpcchyjusxolistcompilecheckcpptext0xab relocation truncated to fit rx8664pc32 against undefined symbol listintcopyalllistint const does anyone have any ideas what this means there doesnt even seem to be a line number associated with it

  correct = student, predicted = student, log-probability score = -91.5
  content = if for example in stackh you want to iterate through the list created by the stack would we be allowed to just openly create iterators given that we have include listh stated at the top

  correct = student, predicted = student, log-probability score = -41.8
  content = is it possible to delete a specific element in an array in the heap not deleting the whole array

  correct = student, predicted = student, log-probability score = -40
  content = why is this already implemented in the starter code are we allowed to modify it to our needs

  correct = student, predicted = student, log-probability score = -17.3
  content = can i make list a friend of stack

  correct = student, predicted = student, log-probability score = -32.8
  content = do we need to test the private functions in listh for instance would we need to test the private constructor for iterator

  correct = student, predicted = student, log-probability score = -42.9
  content = should we write the implementations of public member functions of iterator inside the class or below like the public member functions of list

  correct = student, predicted = student, log-probability score = -285
  content = hey yall for iterator begin i was trying to do something like return iteratorthisfirst thus calling the private iterator constructor but then this happens g wall werror pedantic stdc11 o1 listcompilecheckcpp o listcompilecheck in file included from listcompilecheckcpp10 listh in function ‘int main’ listh16632 error ‘mylistlistintfirst’ is used uninitialized in this function werroruninitialized return iteratorthisfirst listcompilecheckcpp1315 note ‘mylist’ was declared here listint mylist cc1plus all warnings being treated as errors make listcompilecheck error 1 any ideas thanks

  correct = student, predicted = student, log-probability score = -16.5
  content = can we use a helper function in rationalcpp

  correct = student, predicted = student, log-probability score = -132
  content = im looking at whether insertfront and insertback invalidate any iterators my intuition says that insertfront invalidates any iterators pointing to the first element in a list because now that iterator would be pointing to the second element in a list but when i look at insertback it doesnt invalidate any iterators because an iterator pointing to the last element of the list would be listend which is the null pointer right

  correct = student, predicted = student, log-probability score = -76
  content = im trying to use bool operatorconst iterator lhs const iterator rhs but it says the operator has too many parameters i have it defined inside the iterator class

  correct = student, predicted = student, log-probability score = -76.1
  content = is there a solution for task5 or where can i find it onlinei tried but failed for not only vector but also many other types of iterators

  correct = student, predicted = student, log-probability score = -64.2
  content = what should the greatest common denominator function when the denominator is 0 for example simplify24 would return 2 what would simplify40 or 20 return

  correct = student, predicted = student, log-probability score = -23.7
  content = in the list class what is the prev node of the first node in the list 0

  correct = student, predicted = student, log-probability score = -21.2
  content = what is the difference between the two keywords

  correct = student, predicted = student, log-probability score = -136
  content = are there any way to distinguish char and int in the standard input of calccpp i can just use atoi fuction but in this way i feel like i have to define dynamic char with nonfixed size as we have no idea how long input integer will besuch as 1000000

  correct = student, predicted = student, log-probability score = -67.1
  content = is it possible to delete through an iterator i think you would get a compiler error as the overloaded operator isnt actually a pointer but i just want to make sure

  correct = student, predicted = student, log-probability score = -74.2
  content = does template always used for define a class object which is used as a container such as list contains many types of objects and list is defined by template

  correct = student, predicted = student, log-probability score = -82.9
  content = where exactly would we place the g flag in our compile command i am trying to get valgrind to show the line number for locations with memory leaks for my tests for list

  correct = student, predicted = student, log-probability score = -138
  content = i understand that the user of the list class should be able to delete a list i have implemented a destructor for list as well as the other two of the big three however after ive created a list in main and done some list manipulation using the public interface when i try to delete the list using delete list1 i get a cannot delete expression of type listint

  correct = student, predicted = student, log-probability score = -36.3
  content = are we allowed to use pushback and pushfront in our insert function for the iterators

  correct = student, predicted = student, log-probability score = -10.4
  content = the title says it

  correct = student, predicted = student, log-probability score = -59.5
  content = how would we insert an element at the end of a list using the insert function wouldnt the iterator set to be at end be pointing to one past the end or outside the list

  correct = student, predicted = student, log-probability score = -105
  content = i was reviewing the lecture 19 pdf and found that in the slide 40 intlist destructor takes a parameter of const intlist other is this just a mistake or is there reason we would pass another intlist object to the destructor

  correct = student, predicted = student, log-probability score = -77.7
  content = if we point an iterator to the first element in a list then insert an additional element at the beginning of said list for the iterator to be pointing to the new first element we would have to reassign it with begin right

  correct = student, predicted = instructor, log-probability score = -126
  content = should we consider a list is empty if both first and last are 0 it seems like the outcome of the code depends on this if i look at codes in lectures and labs checking only one of them as 0 and both of them as 0 will change the outcome this would happen because sometimes only first is assigned to 0 and then empty is called

  correct = student, predicted = student, log-probability score = -50.5
  content = can we use insert in an empty list if we can we cannot do anything to the iteratorie after the insertion right

  correct = student, predicted = student, log-probability score = -25.7
  content = should the rational 01 be printed out as 0 or as 01

  correct = student, predicted = student, log-probability score = -54.1
  content = i was just wondering if there was a reason that using namespace std was not included in the starter file for the test cases already

  correct = student, predicted = student, log-probability score = -67
  content = we shouldnt be using the insert function to insert elements at the beginning and end of a list right because pushfront and pushback should be taking care of that right

  correct = student, predicted = student, log-probability score = -60.7
  content = if were trying to implement member functions of a class outside of a function that uses a template do we have to initialize a template before every implementation of each member function

  correct = student, predicted = student, log-probability score = -122
  content = in my code i am doing declarations in the class and implementing my code at the bottom of listh i have declared the prefix operator but when i try to implement it i get this error im not sure why i get this since my implementation is almost exactly the same as in the slide decks is there something im missing

  correct = student, predicted = student, log-probability score = -115
  content = effects clause for insert effects inserts datum before the element at the specified position does this mean that the datum at the specified node is overwritten with a new value or a new node containing datum is inserted in the specified list index sorry if this is a dumb question thanks

  correct = student, predicted = student, log-probability score = -88.9
  content = ive read over the specs and understand what must be implemented in stack but am still confused on the overall idea of stack is stack supposed to just hold a list and add items to that list how is stack different from list

  correct = student, predicted = student, log-probability score = -81.1
  content = should our calculator be able to handle 3 3 3 as 3 3 3 or would it always be typed in as a 3 3 3 if three numbers or more can be typed in a row then would this also be the case for 2 3 4 would it be 23 4

  correct = student, predicted = student, log-probability score = -117
  content = i used the iterator to iterate through the list and inside the loop i delete the dereference of the iteratorwhich i think ive deleted the pointer to animals and i also use removefront to remove the elements ive iterated but i still got memory leak

  correct = student, predicted = student, log-probability score = -255
  content = i am confused on how to handle iterators in listh i understand that deleting a node could cause an iterator to become invalidated especially when there is only 1 node that being said the popback and popfront functions dont have any way of knowing about an iterator right so how can we protect against a list growing or shrinking by those function and invalidating the iterator say you have a list datlisttho list node 1 node 2 node 3 node 4 and an iterator i pointing at node 4 datlistthopopback list node 1 node 2 node 3 now the iterator is hanging in lala land how can we protect against that

  correct = student, predicted = student, log-probability score = -49.8
  content = is there a way to use to verify its a chicken or a horse object like ptrtoanimal chicken

  correct = student, predicted = student, log-probability score = -122
  content = i tried writing iterator it in my for loop and got lab11cpp977 error ‘iterator’ was not declared in this scope foriterator itlbegin itlend it is there some other syntax i should be using because this looks like the syntax in the lecture slides

  correct = student, predicted = student, log-probability score = -42.4
  content = after we insert the object should we point the iterator is node pointer to the new node or leave the iterator as it is

  correct = student, predicted = student, log-probability score = -48.1
  content = when i write the implementation for the function iterator operator there is an error message expected unqualifiedid how should i fix it

  correct = student, predicted = student, log-probability score = -205
  content = on page 3 of the lab11 specification i found the question why cant we do that with listanimal and i still dont have a good reason in mind can someone tell me why i reviewed the lecture on feeding llama and i understand that using a pointer container can avoid unnecessary copies and can do something to the real object instead of its copies but still i dont understand why we cant get a collection of both horses and chickens if we do not use a pointer container

  correct = student, predicted = student, log-probability score = -68.6
  content = i know list comes with a decrement operator which we are told not to modify and we are told it will be used for testing can we also use it for our own tests

  correct = student, predicted = student, log-probability score = -70
  content = for the overloaded operator functions we write what do we do if we are taking the invariant cases in the operations for example what should the output of the following be 10 23 10 23 00 23 10 23 10 23 00 23 10 23 10 23 00 23 10 23 10 23 00 23

  correct = student, predicted = student, log-probability score = -87.3
  content = how can we get accessed to the iterator in stackh i wrote the implementation inside the function and used expression like forlistt iterator it it returns the error message something related to type specification

  correct = student, predicted = student, log-probability score = -108
  content = in rationalrationalint numeratorin int denominatorin constructor are we supposed to create a rational number so it follows the invariants within the constructor or just initialize it with given values and fix it when another function is called on the number like getnumerator

  correct = student, predicted = student, log-probability score = -34
  content = does the top of the stack correspond to the front or back of its list

  correct = student, predicted = student, log-probability score = -174
  content = i think i understand what the appropriate jobs of the copy constructor and overloaded are but im having trouble thinking about the context where each would be called in project five if i did this listint newlist listintoldlist which of the two or both would need to be called i dont think both would be necessary because each would ensure that resources are not being shared thansk

  correct = student, predicted = student, log-probability score = -121
  content = in my test case after i made two lists and copied data from original to copy one using assignments operator it seems like im experiencing doublefree it is due to the list destructor works for each lists separately how i can avoid this

  correct = student, predicted = student, log-probability score = -71.7
  content = when we test insert im confused what exactly do we pass in for the iterator i parameter i understand we have to insert something before whever i is pointing to but how can we create a value for i

  correct = student, predicted = student, log-probability score = -85.7
  content = for this function should we be considering the case where the list has only has one element to do something different from the case where the list has more than one element im wondering why it wasnt covered in lecture then for the single linked list

  correct = student, predicted = student, log-probability score = -60.6
  content = just to clarify i dont see it specified in the specs multiplying anything by an undefined number 00 yields an undefined number

  correct = student, predicted = student, log-probability score = -81.1
  content = i am trying to overload the operator and for some reason i am getting the following error message i used the example in the lecture slide but am still unable to get it any advice on how to fix this thanks

  correct = student, predicted = student, log-probability score = -63.4
  content = my asserts are using nullptr instead of 0 would checking if firstlast isnt nullptr be sufficient to check that the list isnt empty

  correct = student, predicted = student, log-probability score = -26.4
  content = are we allowed to use this operator in our implementations for list functions

  correct = student, predicted = student, log-probability score = -27.3

  content = is the code review for project 4 still due on friday i just checked the google drive and the code review sheet still hasnt been posted and the assignment has not been created in ctools yet just wondering on the status of the assignment in case im just missing something thank you

  correct = student, predicted = student, log-probability score = -24.4
  content = the destructor has parameter other is this a typo

  correct = student, predicted = student, log-probability score = -99
  content = i know we are not allowed change the public interface of list but are we allowed to add default constructor for list to set first and last 0 otherwise when we make test cases for empty for example memory junk breaks the assert

  correct = student, predicted = student, log-probability score = -32.5
  content = for copyall should we just be adding the elements from other to the end of this

  correct = student, predicted = student, log-probability score = -37
  content = if we add our implementations of the member functions in the class do we still need function declarations

  correct = student, predicted = student, log-probability score = -73.1
  content = if we either use pushback or pushfront on an empty list will the new element be both the first and last element of the list thus both pointers pointing to the same element thanks

  correct = student, predicted = student, log-probability score = -59
  content = do we need to separately test rational or is the public test sufficient i only ask because it seems pretty in depth

  correct = student, predicted = student, log-probability score = -128
  content = im super confused on erase and insert how can we fix the prev and next as long as we have no wayjust using operator overloading etc get accessed to prev of nodeptr and next from the iterator im struggling with fixing prev or next of previous and next term in erase and insert function thanks

  correct = student, predicted = student, log-probability score = -165
  content = i think i understand the implimentation of the destructor however i am confused on the parameter being passed into the decructor on the bottom of the lecture 19 slides i dont know why it is in their and if i run it with a parameter the complier doesnt like it and when we run it without the parameter it still doesnt work and all we do is call popall is my implimentation wrong or should i have a parameter in the deconstructor if i do need that can someone explain why

  correct = student, predicted = student, log-probability score = -61.2
  content = is an iterator considered invalidated if it points to the first element of a linked list and then we add a new node to the front of the linked list thanks

  correct = student, predicted = student, log-probability score = -96.4
  content = in the erase function in list is it also expected to adjust the next and previous pointers of the next and previous elements or just delete the element ie in popfront do i want to implement the pointer switching there or using if statements in erase

  correct = student, predicted = student, log-probability score = -37.8
  content = do we need to test iterator functions does this consider breaking list interface thanks

  correct = student, predicted = student, log-probability score = -59.3
  content = template typename t typename listtiterator listtiteratoroperator i have to do like above to not get any compile errors is this the right method

  correct = student, predicted = student, log-probability score = -125
  content = there are a couple edge cases i am not sure what will be expected in the autograder for list 1 for pushfront what should it do if there is zero elements in the list 2for pushback what should it do if there is zero elements should one assign the datum to first and one to last or should they both put the new node as the first element in the list

  correct = student, predicted = student, log-probability score = -56.8
  content = i am getting this error but i dont even call the operator in any of my code yet can i not assert that the ptr is valid in my definition of the operator

  correct = student, predicted = student, log-probability score = -133
  content = what should happen if the insert function were called on a dereferenceable iterator for example if insert were called on an iterator one place in memory past the end of a list or one place in memory before the start of a list should we put a new node at the end of the list and put a new node at the beginning of the list respectively i am confused about what to do when the iterator i does not have a node pointer pointing at a valid node thanks in advance

  correct = student, predicted = instructor, log-probability score = -64.8
  content = if weve filled out the final exam conflicts form when do we expect to find out if our exam time is moved and what the new time is

  correct = student, predicted = student, log-probability score = -113
  content = so i am confused how we are supposed to implement our iterator functions i have iterator listtiteratorend const my code here and the compiler is telling me that iterator does not name a type not sure what i am doing wrong the declaration for these functions is left in the class and the implementation is done outside of the class

  correct = student, predicted = student, log-probability score = -131
  content = i just wanted to make sure im getting this right so if i make a rational number r1 with 010 it goes to 01 rational number r2 59 goes to 59 then r2r1 would go to 10 correct or would it go to 10 if you were thinking of it like 105 90

  correct = student, predicted = student, log-probability score = -111
  content = when i type in the command valgrind toolmemcheck leakcheckyes listtestbasicexe i get this message valgrind listtestbasicexe command not found what am i doing wrong i do have listtestbasiccpp and listtestbasicexe files this happens for all my files too not just this specific example how do i run valgrind correctly

  correct = student, predicted = student, log-probability score = -155
  content = so in the spec and the rmes it talks about doing operator overloads for the list class and for the iterator class however per the lecture slides and in the project it seems like i frequently find myself using operators for nodes which i have no overloads written for them such as assignment and comparison should wecan we write operator overloads for these node operators

  correct = student, predicted = student, log-probability score = -353
  content = im sure i am doing something wrong but i cannot figure out what i have become frustrated with various bugs in my listh file so i decided temporarily to reduce the code complexity to just implementing the default constructor because i couldnt figure out how to get the code to call the default constructor or at least print out the text message that i placed inside the curly braces of that default constructor however after taking out 98 of the implementation and recompiling my test program the compiler still finds implementations somehow of all of the old functions despite them not existing any more beyond declarations of functions for example valgrind states i have a have an invalid read of size four from a function that isnt implemented in listh what am i doing wrong what is g actually compiling and working with if it isnt listh

  correct = student, predicted = instructor, log-probability score = -94.3

  content = ive rewatched all of the relevant lectures and im still really struggling with this lab task 1 just wants us to print all of the animals names and their corresponding talk values the list is of pointers to animals what is the relationship between node objects and the animal objects if im drawing out what the memory should look like for task 1 should there even be nodes can we shoehorn an animal into a node what is stored as datum in this context when i access a nodeanimal with an iterator and dereference it i just get an address im struggling to make sense of this because the dereferencing operator should return datum from a node but i think its giving me the address stored by the animal pointer really unsure of this is this animal address on the heap is the pointer on the heap the animals arent even declared in main so i dont even know where they are i have no idea what is going on any help would be greatly appreciated

  correct = student, predicted = instructor, log-probability score = -320
  content = hello this one is more geared towards a prof or gsi in this list rmes for erase and insert it is stated that i is a valid dereferenceable iterator associated with this list in listcompilecheckcpp on line 28 list2 to set equal to mylist which is an empty list since two elements were pushed in and two were popped out on line 30 and iterator named iter is created to be pointing at the beginning of mylist however since mylist is empty the pointer is null please correct me if i am wrong but it seems as if listcompilecheck is violating the rmes which are given this is causing me to fail listcompilecheckcpp becuase my asserts in insert and erase are being thrown due to this null iterator ps i pass my own thorough list tests

  correct = student, predicted = student, log-probability score = -104
  content = are we not allowed to write implementations directly underneath the public member functions of the class we were told to write implementations in h files but i am not sure where else i would write them if not what does it mean by not changing the public interface what is okay and what is not

  correct = student, predicted = student, log-probability score = -24.7
  content = can we use try and catch statements in the driver

  correct = student, predicted = student, log-probability score = -85.5
  content = when listinserts rme states that requires i is a valid iterator associated with this list does this mean i can point to one past the end of the list so that we can insert an object to be at the end of the list

  correct = student, predicted = student, log-probability score = -83.9
  content = quick question regarding the implementation of list size should we use iterators to determine the size of our list and if so do i have to position my implementation of list size below the declaration of the iterator in the list class so no compile errors thanks

  correct = student, predicted = student, log-probability score = -139
  content = for stack why do print and the overloaded operator have the same rme i would think that the overloaded operator should only print out one element modifies os effects prints all the elements of the stack to os starting from the top element each element printed is followed by a space including the last element do not print a newline if the stack is empty print nothing returns os

  correct = student, predicted = instructor, log-probability score = -47

  correct = student, predicted = student, log-probability score = -95.2
  content = the input files for testing calccpp do not have q at the last line so if i do calc calctest01out calctest01in it goes into infinite loop should we test it by putting q at the end of in file

  correct = student, predicted = student, log-probability score = -74.3

  correct = student, predicted = student, log-probability score = -65.5
  content = since this is a template should our tests work for arbitrary types t or should we just make a version using say ints and test with that

  correct = student, predicted = student, log-probability score = -244
  content = do we necessarily have to assert that the invariants are met when implementing rationalcpp for example invariant 1 is that the denominator must always be 0 and the numerator must be positive now if i merely asserted that statement in the constructor input such as rational 10 3 would fail even though that input should be modified to be appear as rational 10 3 so instead of asserting these statements i created functions that look for situations described in the invariants and modify the values if they are found to violate a condition is this method allowed

  correct = student, predicted = student, log-probability score = -74.6

  correct = student, predicted = student, log-probability score = -197
  content = hello i see that we are allowed to add the big three being the destructor copy constructor and overloaded assignment operator to the public interface of stackh i am in the belief that this is needed but also that we need to implement a custom default constructor my reason being is that i implemented the big three default constructor and have good results with make stacktests with all tests passed and no valgrind errors when i comment out the default constructor my stack does not even compile so is adding the big three default constructor allowed thank you

  correct = student, predicted = student, log-probability score = -32.8
  content = for listh since the destructor is a public function do we need to test it if so how

  correct = student, predicted = student, log-probability score = -97.4
  content = in listh we have the following two pointers node first last with the description points to firstlast node in list or 0 if list is empty so we have that empty list implies first last 0 but do we know that first last 0 implies empty list without this knowledge we cannot determine if a list is empty or not

  content = im sorry this is absurd my partner and i ran all the public tests for euchre and got no different output using sdiff then we submit to the autograder and it doesnt give us a grade for hours and hours until way past the deadline i check today and we got 01 on the euchre public tests this is absolutely unfair considering we passed the test on our computers and caen and then the autograder gave us a 01 and there was no way of us knowing this or fixing this this is very poor planning and extremely ridiculous that there is no project extension and was no better explanation as to how it could occur that we pass tests on our computer and get 01 on autograder

  correct = student, predicted = instructor, log-probability score = -49.5
  content = any news on when project 5 will be out just trying to get a head start this weekend

  correct = student, predicted = student, log-probability score = -496
  content = this might not be possible but one idea i have is maybe there could be the output line in the local tests for the sdiff the outputcorrect files the local test correct outputs are technically not correct they do not have the top line we need to cout people were literally sdiffing against outputs that would not pass in the autograder which is one of the reasons this project was a little devestating for some pople it almost feels like a trick not that this is an accusation it seems like this course is always building on itself nothing is perfect ever either if this is possible to do this despite the different way you use the terminal for these tests i would recommend adding in the first line to these tests so that the outputcorrects would pass in an autograder overall i felt the wording for how we cout the line was vague particularly in how many new lines we needed for it it just says then print them which is vague about whether you want one newline so that it tops hand 0 or two newlines so that its a space above hand 0 the latter which looks better in my opinion but i get a vibe that it was the former it would be cool to see the outputcorrect for what this looks like exactly when testing

  correct = student, predicted = student, log-probability score = -6.99
  content = what do i do now

  correct = student, predicted = student, log-probability score = -126
  content = so i just checked my autorgrader score and i received a 410 it says we had the incorrect output for the testcases including the public ones however when we ran them on caen and diffed the output with the correct there was no difference how is this possible

  correct = student, predicted = instructor, log-probability score = -261
  content = i hate myself for asking this but does one bad grade on a project destroy any hopes at an a im a bit frustrated because almost all of my autograder errors came from not including algorithm in player for the sort function and i just dont want one include statement and the one associated function we were supposed to use from it to ruin my chances at a decent grade in the class like some other people have said im not trying to discount the autograder im just a bit anxious about how this one include statement will affect my prospects in the class sorry for being obnoxious

  correct = student, predicted = student, log-probability score = -119
  content = hi my submission in the autograder was just graded and it gave us a 01 for player public test but i just ran my code on terminal and it passes and im almost 100 positive that my playercpp is correct because in an earlier submission i passed the test and my code for that file is the same could this be an autograder error

  correct = student, predicted = student, log-probability score = -529
  content = i just got my autograder feedback and im a bit concerned i ran the public test cases through caen using the makefile and it compiled with no problem i figured since these are the same public test cases as the autograder and i tested it on caen that they would at least compile when i got my feedback from the autograder my playercpp file didnt compile and it gave me back an error that i never got with caen as a result nothing compiled after that so obviously i failed a lot of tests does this mean that im going to get an extremely low grade on the project since pretty much the last 23 of it doesnt compile my project isnt perfect but what i turned in is 90 done and while it definitely still has a few bugs its almost all the way there im concerned im going to get a 15 or something on this heres the error message i got from the autograder this didnt show up when i ran it on caen i understand the problem although it doesnt affect how the code runs in this case and its like a 2 second fix the problem is that i didnt get this error until i used the autograder is there anything i can or should do about this thanks playercpp in member function virtual card simpleleadcardconst string playercpp14746 error bestcard may be used uninitialized in this function werrormaybeuninitialized playcard handindexbestcardinhand playercpp in member function virtual card simpleplaycardconst card const string playercpp15769 error bestcard may be used uninitialized in this function werrormaybeuninitialized playcard handhighestcardofsuitledcardgetsuit trump cc1plus all warnings being treated as errors

  correct = student, predicted = instructor, log-probability score = -258
  content = is there any reason why we cannot get a project extension its ridiculous that we are expected to not work on our projects the day it is due the instructors are essentially saying that its our faults that the autograder is down and we should have known to submit before today i have many other obligations that prevent me from working nonstop on my projects but i expected to be able to check my autograder score to help me see what i needed to fix i lost a day to work on my project because i could not check my code against the autograder that isnt fair and it isnt fair to tell students to take whatever grade they get on the autograder without seeing whether or not it compiledreceived a score

  correct = student, predicted = instructor, log-probability score = -144
  content = autograder is not working saying this is why you shouldnt wait until the last day is ridiculous you made it due until then and implied wed have all resources to work on it now we have to blindly submit code that by your design will completely fail with small errors very dissapointed

  content = why am i getting this error my class starts off with class human public player public

  correct = student, predicted = student, log-probability score = -98.4
  content = is there a reason that my code has the exact same output for test00 but my test01 output is different enough that the players have different cards i checked over our shuffling and dealing functions and havent found an issue

  correct = student, predicted = instructor, log-probability score = -323
  content = an entire day of the project is gone no testing no submitting you cant do anything it is quite unfair to students who were told in the syllabus that they were going to be given a certain amount of days to do the project i made a slight change in my project today but have not gotten the autograde in hours this would be alright if we could test on environments exactly like the autograder but even caen is different i suggest that project turn ins on sundays or tuesdays days when less eecs classes have projects due there is precedent of an extension being granted in a situation just like the one today the eecs dept prides itself on being fair to students but this is an example of every student being given one less day to do the project

  content = when i run my code through caen and check the diff between euchretest00outeuchretest00outcorrect euchretest01 and euchretest50 all compile and run fine and according to diff the output matches the correct outputs however the autograder just finished grading my files and all three of these tests got 01 due to the output being incorrect what would cause this

  correct = student, predicted = instructor, log-probability score = -224
  content = i am passing all my test cases in caen including the file comparisons with euchretest00outcorrect euchretest01outcorrect and euchretest50outcorrect after running my code on the autograder i received output differences for all euchre tests i changed my code so that all print statements occur the euchrecpp file except for cases when user input is need for a human player however now i cant see if this indeed solved the issue because i have been on the autograder que for over an hour will the issue of the que be solved sometime before 8pm

  correct = student, predicted = instructor, log-probability score = -84.1
  content = if our projects are cued by 8pm does this mean they will still get graded or are we only graded on the submissions that make it through the cue before the due time

  correct = student, predicted = instructor, log-probability score = -27.1
  content = will the recording of lecture 19 be posted soon

  correct = student, predicted = student, log-probability score = -69.8
  content = in my test cases i notice i have created pointers to dynamic players by using player factory so when do i delete them in each test cases or do i need to write the delete in the functions

  correct = student, predicted = student, log-probability score = -115
  content = 1can i sort cards in hand and discard lowest one or should i find the index of lowest card and replace that one to upside card 2to choose lowest one should i consider upside card as a led card i am planning to use second cardless function

  correct = student, predicted = student, log-probability score = -67.2
  content = i have an array to contain all the cards of a player is it better to have vector or to have an array do we need to use the sortable property of vector later in the project

  correct = student, predicted = student, log-probability score = -109
  content = my partner has a mac and his player code compiles with sort but when he sends me the same code and i run it on cygwin it says sort is not declared in scope every time it is called it is the same exact code is there an explanation for this

  correct = student, predicted = student, log-probability score = -87.6
  content = does the algorithm itself consist of one one handed shuffle so when we want to shuffle do we call the algorithm three times or is the three one handed shuffles encased within the packshuffle function

  correct = student, predicted = instructor, log-probability score = -33.1
  content = when will mondays lecture recording be posted thank you in advance

  correct = student, predicted = student, log-probability score = -66.8
  content = should our code be able to account for multiple types of players for example two human players and two simple players where each human player is paired with a simple player

  correct = student, predicted = student, log-probability score = -43.6
  content = is there a specific way to write our dealing function or is it okay for us to hardcode it

  correct = student, predicted = student, log-probability score = -66.1
  content = for example if we declare the subclasses on the top of the playercpp and implement them below the declaration of classes is it considered a better style thanks

  correct = student, predicted = student, log-probability score = -109
  content = i have run into a problem in euchrecpp i am calling packshuffle and it is definitely being called but it is not shuffling i have tested it and it shuffles fine would there be any reason that when i call shuffle on a pack in one of my function in euchrecpp it would not saveregister the shuffle

  correct = student, predicted = student, log-probability score = -37.6

  correct = student, predicted = student, log-probability score = -110
  content = in both the shuffle and noshuffle situations after each hand that is after printing out alice and cathy win the hand alice and cathy have 1 points bob and drew have 0 points do we shuffle the pack do we reset the pack or do we do so only when the pack index reach its maximum

  correct = student, predicted = student, log-probability score = -366

  content = i understand that we will be testing our pack constructors using string streams where applicable but will i get marked down in the autograder for also including a test function that uses an ifstream i understand these constructors will be handgraded but i would like to do testing for it on my own thank you in advance tldr can i write test functions for pack constructors that read from a file without getting marked down by the autograder

  correct = student, predicted = student, log-probability score = -62.8
  content = do we need to include assert statements to check that the inputparameters for each function meets the conditions stated in the rmes

  correct = student, predicted = student, log-probability score = -123
  content = i am not sure if this is correct perhaps i did not correctly initialize something these errors keep coming up every time i try to compile and i have no idea what they mean i have been working on them for quite a while and i was wondering if anyone had any suggestions

  correct = student, predicted = student, log-probability score = -84.6
  content = in euchrecpp we created an array to store the player pointers created by the factory however when we try to call member functions from playercpp on it we get a segfault any advice on how to fix this thanks

  correct = student, predicted = student, log-probability score = -125
  content = when we are using sort we are sorting it based on whats defined in not considering the trump and lead card in the spec it says when reaching human players we should use sort and print the cards in the ascending order im just wondering if its better to improve the spec if we can print the cards in the ascending order considering the trump and lead card too not just

  correct = student, predicted = student, log-probability score = -59.5
  content = for the comparison operators should our code work for every card or are we only accounting for those included in a euchre deck

  correct = student, predicted = student, log-probability score = -41.6
  content = i pass packpublictest on caen but get points off on the autograder what could be wrong

  correct = student, predicted = student, log-probability score = -85.7
  content = in the spec it does not mention what to do when under human player you are dealer and in round two and the human enters pass should we follow the simple player procedure and make them order up

  correct = student, predicted = student, log-probability score = -39.4
  content = are we supposed to write test functions for the constructors of human player they are not in the header file

  correct = student, predicted = student, log-probability score = -357

  content = how do we read from the format of two of spades to type card where a suit and rank are assigned

  correct = student, predicted = student, log-probability score = -159
  content = so for player i can get my code to run fine when i create the classes simple and human in playerh and then implement them in playercpp but in the specs i noticed that you arent supposed to modify h files and i am unable to make it work under playercpp is there a method to this other than creating the class and just filling in the implementations inside the class where you declare them

  correct = student, predicted = instructor, log-probability score = -124
  content = so how would i go about using the next index to split the deck at the 17th card and how do i take those last few cards and assign them to the first 7 cards while pushing back the rest so that im not overwriting cards or am i going about this the wrong way

  correct = student, predicted = student, log-probability score = -139
  content = i am a little confused on what would be passed into the maketrump function for the orderupsuit parameter i understand changing it if a player chooses a suit or picks up the card but what do you pass in as that string the trump suit always obviously a suit hasnt been ordered up if we are asking a player if they want to order up a suit

  correct = student, predicted = student, log-probability score = -120
  content = when printing the dealers hand after someone in the first round orders up do we print the dealers hand in ascending order as well because in appendix b alices hand isnt printed in sorted order jack of hearts is greater than ten of diamonds

  correct = student, predicted = student, log-probability score = -185
  content = in euchrecpp i created a array to store pointers to player as below player playersnumofplayer and i try to initialize the array in a loop reading from argv like below playersi playerfactoryargvi 4 argvi 5 i got error euchrecpp in function void initializeplayersint char player int euchrecpp9314 error no match for operator operand types are player and player playersi p even though i think operand type are both player thanks

  content = i have run the public test on vs and it returned three of spades and pass on a new line but when i submitted on the autograder it gave me the feedback that the return code is incorrect does anyone know whats wrong with that

  correct = student, predicted = student, log-probability score = -186
  content = i just wanted to make sure that the following assumption is safe because it was not mentioned in the rme when the maketrump function is called the suit of orderupsuit will always be identical to the suit of upcard for example if upcard is a nine of spades then the orderupsuit will always be spades if upcard is a jack of spades then the orderupsuit will always be spades etc because orderupsuit is providing redundant informationnamely the suit of the upcard its only purpose in the maketrump function is to be modified in the appropriate situations are these safe reasonable assumptions thanks

  correct = student, predicted = student, log-probability score = -232
  content = i did read the faq about this but my problem appears to be different i only have print statements in euchrecpp except for in the human player class when i print their hand and prompt their choices when i run test00 test 01 and test50 both locally and on caen and then diff them against the correct output files the only difference is the first line the command line arguments nonetheless the autograder says i am failing test00 test01 and test50 what else besides print statements in the wrong files could be causing this problem thanks in advance

  correct = student, predicted = student, log-probability score = -79.8

  content = my player public test passes on my laptop so why do i still get 01 on the autograder

  correct = student, predicted = student, log-probability score = -101
  content = the corrections and clarifications say that we must check for the requires clause for functions that take a string representing the trump suit as a parameter this function just takes a string called suit for parameter which is not necessarily the trump suit do we still check for it

  correct = student, predicted = student, log-probability score = -160
  content = i just want to make sure that i am correct in assuming that if making trump reaches round 2 the jack of the suit of the same color is still considered a member of its actual suit rather than the suit of the upcard ex if the upcard is nine of hearts the jack of diamonds is considered a diamond and not a heart is this correct sorry i have never played this game before and just wanted to make sure aliya

  content = ill apologize in advance if this question has already been asked my question pertains to what happens when the dealer gets the opportunity to maketrump at the end of round 1 normally they would be considered able to pick up the card shown so what if the upcard is a face card and the dealer during round 1 only holds 1 card which would become trump if the upcards suit were trump shouldnt this edge case qualify as the simple player deciding to make that suit trump as by the end of the play theyd have at least two trump face cards however the euchretest00outcorrect doesnt allow for this possibility as the upcard is a jack of diamonds the dealer alice holds the jack of hearts yet alice is supposed to pass and not call diamonds as trump is this behavior correct are we not supposed to consider the possibility that the dealer can sometimes call trump and pick up the card adding to the number of trump they hold thanks

  correct = student, predicted = student, log-probability score = -135
  content = in testing void functions like addcard or addanddiscard i understand that we cannot test these directly because we cannot access the private member variables so i am wondering if it is recommended to make test cases for these functions and call another function like playcard or something to test or if it is best to not make test cases for them and test them through test functions for other functions i hope i am understanding this correctly

  correct = student, predicted = student, log-probability score = -64.3
  content = i was wondering since cards the array and packsize are not available for use in readpack how we were suppose to return the array of cards created

  content = the project spec shows this prompt for make trump but what about round 1 where you can only choose the upcards suit would you need a different promt and different user input do we print anything out a new prompt if the input is not an actual suit or do we just assume it is print the hand of each player during the making procedure followed by a prompt for their making decision human player bobs hand 0 nine of spades human player bobs hand 1 ten of spades human player bobs hand 2 jack of spades human player bobs hand 3 king of hearts human player bobs hand 4 ace of hearts human player bob please enter a suit or pass

  correct = student, predicted = student, log-probability score = -101
  content = should we be keeping track of how many cards are in the players hand i was thinking that would help in discarding a card from the hand but since we arent supposed to have constructors for the players how would we initialize handsize 0 at the beginning

  correct = student, predicted = student, log-probability score = -138
  content = right now if we just do playerfactoryplayer simple cout player it prints out the memory location when we playerfactorplayer simple cout player it works since player factor returns a pointer do we need to fix our extraction operator implementation or just remember to always dereference the player in terms of what is expected on the autograder

  correct = student, predicted = student, log-probability score = -112
  content = could we use an operator overload for the operator to compare to cstyle strings its currently giving me a compiler error overload must have at least one parameter of class or enumeration type but there has to be some sort of way right

  correct = student, predicted = student, log-probability score = -60.2
  content = in card and pack we were given values to use for the default constructors is there any specific way we should implement the default constructors for simple and human thanks

  correct = student, predicted = student, log-probability score = -108
  content = in our make trump for the human player should we make sure that during round one the user can only type in the suit of the upcard or pass or can we assume that they will only type a valid response because you cant choose your own suit until round 2

  correct = student, predicted = student, log-probability score = -52.4
  content = can we assume that the packinput is formatted correctly if its not how should we handle an incorrectly formatted file

  correct = student, predicted = student, log-probability score = -37
  content = i typed make cardpublictest and received these errors please help

  correct = student, predicted = student, log-probability score = -113
  content = hi in the spec it doesnt say anything about what we should do if a person attempts to deal more cards than a pack has should we print an error message or be procactive and reset the deck when the deck becomes empty in dealone

  correct = student, predicted = student, log-probability score = -367
  content = so i created an array in one of my test functions for card and filled it with different cards that i created using the nondefault constructor the first element in the array is correct calling array0getrank and array0getsuit return the expected results but none of the subsequent elements are correct array1getrank returns two and array1getsuit returns spades it looks like all elements in the array after the first were created using the default constructor i have another instance of this type of card array in a different test file that works i copy and pasted one of the correct constructions into the faulty one and there was no change i have tested both the default and nondefault constructors as well as the getters and all work when i copy the constructor for the card i assign into array1 and use it to replace the constructor used on the card placed into array0 aka the cards placed into the first and second array locations have identical constructors array0 returns the proper nondefault constructed card but array1 returns what looks like a default constructed card i am completely confused any advice would be appreciated thanks

  correct = student, predicted = student, log-probability score = -108
  content = i understand that a player orders up during round 1 if the dealer is a human player is hand is printed and ask what card to discard but how exactly do we check if the dealer is a human or simple player if we cant modify the public interface to create a getstrategy function

  correct = student, predicted = student, log-probability score = -120
  content = are we going to get docked points for style if we have a very substantial amount of if statements in the card less functions i feel like that is most likely the only way to do it at least that seems apparent it is just a lot to look at

  correct = student, predicted = student, log-probability score = -164
  content = in the spec it talks about if a human player is the dealer and someone orders up trump than the game should prompt the dealer with the option to discard this is not something that should be included in making trump correct maketrump should only prompt the user with the option to select a suit and then end and then the discard business can be dealt with within addanddiscard and used in euchrecpp the spec isnt really clear on this

  correct = student, predicted = student, log-probability score = -101
  content = im trying to sort a standard array i looked at 1895 and i made a copy of the original standard array but i get the error invalid operands to binary expression arraycard maxhandsize and int

  correct = student, predicted = student, log-probability score = -63.8
  content = is there an estimated length of function implementations my partner and i wanna make sure our code both works and is efficient

  correct = student, predicted = student, log-probability score = -43.9
  content = are we allowed to use a temporary array to hold the last 6 values in the cards array for shuffle

  correct = student, predicted = student, log-probability score = -26.6
  content = should we output two of spades with or without a newline

  correct = student, predicted = student, log-probability score = -94.2
  content = if human player is dealer and someone orders up during first round how do we know which card the dealer wants to discard outside of this function since we cant discard within this functionits const thank you

  correct = student, predicted = student, log-probability score = -59.8
  content = why is it that for the base class there are no constructors but we do need a virtual destructor i see why we need the destructor but why no constructor in the base thanks saul

  correct = student, predicted = student, log-probability score = -90.4
  content = since the specs said it is safe to assume that the human will always type in the correct value so when it comes to screw the dealer we dont need to check for anything because it is safe to assume the human player will type in the correct suit and not pass

  correct = student, predicted = instructor, log-probability score = -429
  content = im curious as to why points are awardedtaken away for having the rmes present in the cpp files themselves it seems more intuitive to have these reserved for the header files keeping the implementation files much cleaner hopefully points can be given back for this small distinction as its more convenient to see what the function is supposed to do in the header then read the implementation without any clutter in the cpp file also i find it kind of cumbersome that the default indentation spacing size in the starter files is usually two space lengths whereas most modern ides and editors use a four space indentation which should we use i feel that many students were docked points for this discrepancy and its a fairly overlooked distinction its just a matter of style and i think that it should be explicitly stated in the spec which tab size is used otherwise points would be taken off for a teacherstudent discrepancy

  correct = student, predicted = student, log-probability score = -63.5
  content = in the specs it says we have to print out the cards in ascending order does this mean i just print it out or can i also order the cards in the players hand in ascending order or am i not allowed to change the order of the cards in a players hand

  correct = student, predicted = student, log-probability score = -27.8
  content = is there a way to test addanddiscard with the given functions we have in player

  correct = student, predicted = student, log-probability score = -165
  content = im not exactly sure how to go about testing player it seems difficult to test functions in player given that theres no way to access the players hand directly for example to test addcard you have to call addcard but to assert that the card you added is now at the end of the players hand you have to call playcard with two arguments and the card returned depends on the values of your arguments is there something im missing or an easier way to work with the players hand

  correct = student, predicted = instructor, log-probability score = -25.3
  content = when will recordings of lecture 19 be posted

  correct = student, predicted = student, log-probability score = -55.8
  content = are we allowed to add functions to the simple class in the public realm to do this do we have to add it in the public field for playercpp as well

  correct = student, predicted = student, log-probability score = -28.1
  content = for the add and discard function are we supposed to discard the worst card

  correct = student, predicted = student, log-probability score = -63.4
  content = when implementing the pack initializers does the cards have to be in the initializer list or can it be assigned inside the curly braces

  correct = student, predicted = student, log-probability score = -29.1
  content = is it allowed to use same alias for a multiple object

  correct = student, predicted = student, log-probability score = -83.2
  content = for the given sort function how does it know how to sort it in the correct order for example say your lowest card is a jack but that is actually the left bower you would not want to discard that card so how does that work out

  correct = student, predicted = student, log-probability score = -149
  content = my partner and i are failing the assert statements in the check pack function in the pack public test file our firstcard is being read in correctly nine of spades spacing is correct and matches the output given by this line cardcardranknine cardsuitspades we printed out both cards to check yet we are still failing the assert statement thanks for the help

  correct = student, predicted = student, log-probability score = -85.7
  content = for the 2nd and 3rd constructor are we to assume that the in file or istream will always contain 24 cards if not what should we do if there is less than 24 cards should there be a error message

  correct = student, predicted = student, log-probability score = -97.3
  content = when i am debugging for pack using the pack public test and when i run the code in entirety i get a seg fault but if i comment out one of the tests and run it it passes this happens no matter which test i comment out is there any fix for that

  correct = student, predicted = student, log-probability score = -99.9
  content = when playing a trick a player must follow suit of the lead card assuming the lead card is not also part of the trump suit does the suit for the lead card not include a left bower eg trump clubs lead hearts i cannot play a jack of diamonds to follow suit correct

  correct = student, predicted = student, log-probability score = -155
  content = i am pretty confused about the pack constructor that takes in no arguments if this function is building a pack it needs to get that data from somewhere i understand that i have a function that builds individual cards for the pack but that function needs a rank and a suit where would my default pack constructor get that data from the other pack constructors are less confusing because they get information on wherewhat pack to read thanks

  correct = student, predicted = student, log-probability score = -98.3
  content = in task 3 of lab 09 we are asked to set data to null wouldnt that be redundant since data would go out of scope and deleted once arrayintvector is deallocated

  correct = student, predicted = student, log-probability score = -82.1
  content = this is an error i am getting when i run lab09cpp in xcode and caen libcabidylib terminating with uncaught exception of type stdbadalloc stdbadalloc any advice

  correct = student, predicted = student, log-probability score = -179
  content = so me and my partner are stumped here on this function it feels like a trick question because at this point we dont see how 1 a pack could ever be empty and 2 how you could ever check this given the variables at our disposal ive read a number of other posts where instructors are insisting there is always 24 cards in a pack any hep with this function would be appreciated

  correct = student, predicted = student, log-probability score = -168
  content = just some clarification on isdealer in the maketrump function for simple player in round 1 does isdealer play any role within the maketrump function as far as i could read it does not the dealer adds and discards a card if a card is ordered up but this cant happen here since the function is a bool const function right in round 2 isdealer determines whether the screw the dealer event occurs

  correct = student, predicted = student, log-probability score = -87.6
  content = is it permissible to use static const variables in my test file for example declaring certain strings at the top of the file that i would like to use throughout the file instead of redeclaring them in each test function

  correct = student, predicted = student, log-probability score = -32.7
  content = after a hand is completed does the dealer stay the same for the next hand

  correct = student, predicted = student, log-probability score = -24.3
  content = if all cards are unique what is the use of the overload

  correct = student, predicted = student, log-probability score = -40.2
  content = it is impossible for the dealer to order up in the first round right the deal can only order up in round 2 right

  correct = student, predicted = student, log-probability score = -98.9
  content = what exactly am i supposed to do with playercpp i know im supposed to make subclasses simple and human but i dont really see how the functions differ too much besides simple moves by itself and human takes in inputs

  correct = student, predicted = student, log-probability score = -29.3
  content = partner and i are getting this error and have no clue what it means

  correct = student, predicted = student, log-probability score = -45
  content = im having trouble understanding this error its an error in the header file which i havent touched

  correct = student, predicted = student, log-probability score = -140
  content = some constructors are defined as constructor int ain int bin aain bbin and constructor int ain int bin thisa ain thisb bin what is the difference and how do they effect the program also if you are using can you have a forloop after and before to assign values to an array inside constructor

  correct = student, predicted = student, log-probability score = -124
  content = when initializing cards and whenever you refer to their suit or rank is it alright if we just use strings such as spades diamonds or jack or do we have to use rankjack suitdiamonds etc i believe either way is fine but i just want to double check

  correct = student, predicted = student, log-probability score = -81.4
  content = i am confused on how to make the dealer perform an action such as pick up the upcard if bool isdealer is false can someone help me out

  correct = student, predicted = student, log-probability score = -118
  content = i am a little bit confused on the difference if any between human players and simple players when making trump does a human player use the same screw the dealer method as a simple player if a human player dealer has to choose trump in round 2 will they automatically choose the next suit of the upcard thank you

  correct = student, predicted = student, log-probability score = -23.8
  content = this what i get when i put the commands into my terminal

  correct = student, predicted = student, log-probability score = -126
  content = do we need test cases for every function even if theyre essentially tested somewhere else for example in one of my pack test files i use the dealone function to test whether in the case of each constructor the correct cards have been initialized inside of the pack in the correct order doesnt using dealone to test each constructor adequately test dealone as well

  correct = student, predicted = student, log-probability score = -98.5
  content = i finished implementing all of my test cases for cardteststartercpp and i created my cardcpp file i implemented one function and tried to compile my code and a bunch of errors popped up do anyone have any ideas of what the problem could be

  correct = student, predicted = student, log-probability score = -105
  content = is it acceptable to use an array for your hand in euchre that is set at 5 i have another parameter to keep track of the number of cards in my hand making the array only accessible for the of cards in the hard however those extra cards could be any value

  correct = student, predicted = student, log-probability score = -66.3
  content = when next 23 ie there is no next card in the cards array what should the behavior of dealone be does it reset next to 0 and deal the first card in the cards array

  correct = student, predicted = student, log-probability score = -99.2
  content = we are trying to implement euchercpp by first making an array of all players so we can simplify the game process but we are having trouble doing this since we can only make simple or human players any suggestions on this

  correct = student, predicted = student, log-probability score = -74.7
  content = is it correct to assume that if the player is the dealer and it is the first round that you take into account the upcard when determining how many face cards of the trump suit there are

  correct = student, predicted = student, log-probability score = -98.6
  content = im slightly confused if we were to lay a pack of cards faced down would the default next index 0 represent the card on the top or the bottom of the pile thanks

  correct = student, predicted = student, log-probability score = -117
  content = the corrections for the project state that test files should be independent specifically do not include packh in any of your implementation or test files for card and player since cardh is included in packh and packh is included in our tests is it safe to assume that we can use functions from the card class in our pack tests

  correct = student, predicted = student, log-probability score = -180
  content = i am creating a temporary pointer to fulfill the task to expand the array int tmpptr new arrayintvectordatacapacity i feel like i should be calling the arrayintvector constructor as above however when i do this i get a type error int tmpptr new intdatacapacity when i do this it works and i can reassign data to point to the address that tmpptr points to but im not using the arrayintvector class what is wrong with the first approach thanks

  correct = student, predicted = student, log-probability score = -381
  content = hello when i compile with make playertestexe for my test cases or make playerpublictest i get pages of strange errors which are said to be in cardh on line 16 only this is very strange because this wasnt happening like 30 minutes ago in this time all i did was write implementations for the human player functions there is an error and a note that appear many times in the terminal response usrincludec482bitsstlheaph23729 error no match for ‘operator’ operand types are ‘const card’ and ‘stdremovereferencetype aka const card’ first holeindex glibcxxmovefirst secondchild and cardh167 note card cardoperatorconst card class card cardh167 note no known conversion for implicit ‘this’ parameter from ‘const card’ to ‘card’ cardh167 note card cardoperatorcard cardh167 note no known conversion for argument 1 from ‘stdremovereferencetype aka const card’ to ‘card’ any help would be appreciated

  correct = student, predicted = student, log-probability score = -52
  content = if we are using a vector for the hand of each type of player should we be calling delete hand during the deconstructor for each player class

  correct = student, predicted = student, log-probability score = -106
  content = for the and operator functions is there a reason why comparing rank by doing simple comparisons like rank of lhs rank of rhs works correctly for rank but not for suit suit of lhs suit of lhs is this just an overall ineffective way of comparing the cards or is it specific to suit

  correct = student, predicted = student, log-probability score = -94.1
  content = i implemented a factory just as described in the spec but i am receiving this error when i compile playercpp620 error expected typespecifier before ‘simpleplayer’ where the line is return new simpleplayer

  correct = student, predicted = student, log-probability score = -237
  content = my understanding is that when i write something like player myplayer new humanplayer or use playerfactory accordingly i should just call delete myplayer at the end of the program but that is redundant to do for 4 players so i initialize an array player players and then set every element of the array to a dynamically allocated player either human or simple when deleting i could use a loop to delete the object stored at each address but that also seems redundant is there a clean way to delete all the objects pointed to by pointers in players i know delete players is not really correct because that is used to delete a dynamically allocated array of players not an array of player ptrs

  correct = student, predicted = student, log-probability score = -58.6
  content = in our implementation of the pack constructor is it correct for me to think that we would initialize the next index to be 0 ie the first card in the pack thanks

  correct = student, predicted = student, log-probability score = -112
  content = from the spec if a human player is the dealer and someone orders up during the first round of making print the player’s hand and an option to discard the upcard then prompt the user to select a card to discard if the round was 2 then what would happen

  correct = student, predicted = student, log-probability score = -308
  content = in lab09 it states one of the undesirable consequences of using classes for adts is that the private member variables end up being visible to the outside world even though they are part of the implementation and should be hidden away as described in lecture we can fix this problem by separating the declaration into an interface­ only abstract base class and providing the implementation in a derived class i dont quite understand the statement about private member variables i thought these are always hidden from the outside world since they are allocated as private or it it referring to the case where you can access a private member through a public function such as getname also how does separating the class into an interface and derived class resolve this issue

  correct = student, predicted = student, log-probability score = -26.6
  content = do we need to implement the destructor for player in our playercpp file

  correct = student, predicted = student, log-probability score = -61.5
  content = i still dont understand how you can tell when a card is less value than another is it just comparing the rank does the suit matter

  correct = student, predicted = student, log-probability score = -44
  content = is a game struct the only one that is necessary would it be unecessary to create a team struct

  correct = student, predicted = student, log-probability score = -84.7

  correct = student, predicted = student, log-probability score = -87.7
  content = in cardpublictestcpp theres a test for cardless that has two cards which are both three of spades and a card led that is the three of spades what should be the correct output and why should this combination of parameters be possible

  correct = student, predicted = student, log-probability score = -49
  content = is it ok if my derived classes of human and simple have some of the exact same private members

  correct = student, predicted = student, log-probability score = -146
  content = in the spec and judging off of piazza all helper functions must be static are we allowed to create a constructor public member function for the simple and human subclasses of player that initializes name and the players hand to be empty or is that considered a helper function i know you cant have a static constructor sorry if this question was asked but i could not find it

  correct = student, predicted = student, log-probability score = -130
  content = i am confused with readpack first of all it is an istream and not an ifstream i am confused as to what may be passed in as an istream for example would the function be called with packin as a parameter second of all if packin is not passed as a parameter how do we access packin in the implementation of the function i noticed that there is no open member function for istreams what is the difference between istream and ifstream

  correct = student, predicted = student, log-probability score = -32.7
  content = does add and discard take into account trump for the simple player

  correct = student, predicted = student, log-probability score = -91.2
  content = if i have a pack i have created in a stringstream is there a cleaner way of testing its equivalence to packin without looping through the whole stringstream and comparing every word thanks

  correct = student, predicted = student, log-probability score = -73.6
  content = im not really sure how to initialize a pack beside the default like how would i test a pack would it be by doing 24 assert statements and checking each card in the pack

  correct = student, predicted = student, log-probability score = -77.3
  content = in the specs it says to debug in gdb to replace 01 with g in the makefile im confused about how to do this do i call make debug so it adds g to cxxflags thanks

  correct = student, predicted = student, log-probability score = -64.8
  content = when we implement the derived classes for player im confused whether we should be creating an array to store the cards in the players hand or use a vector

  correct = student, predicted = student, log-probability score = -51.4
  content = are we supposed to make a simpleplayerh file or can we just essentially use the playerh class file as the outline

  correct = student, predicted = student, log-probability score = -79.9
  content = do we assume the pack size is always 24 so when we write the shuffle function we can assume were always cutting the pack at 17 or is there a ratio at which you cut a pack of any size to shuffle

  correct = student, predicted = student, log-probability score = -77
  content = for the multiple test files im a bit confused should each test file have tests for each function in cardscpp or can we break it up and you would run all files to catch bugs

  correct = student, predicted = student, log-probability score = -54.1
  content = for the readpack function in packcpp are we required to implement this function or can we leave it blankhave it do nothing

  correct = student, predicted = student, log-probability score = -59.1
  content = my partner and i have been struggling on the operator functions and were wondering how we are supposed to access ranknamesbyweight and suitnamesbyweight

  correct = student, predicted = student, log-probability score = -138
  content = how buggy are the intentionally buggy implementations that are going to be run for the grading for example is it possible for the buggy implementation to have only incorrect implementation for cardisface function for ten of clubs so that it is returned as true but it returns correctly for all other cards and if a case like that example is possible does it mean that we have to test for every single possibility

  correct = student, predicted = student, log-probability score = -99.2
  content = my understanding for the player class is that we have to implement our own subclasses of player that have their own virtual functions and data members is it up to us how we implement these functions and private data members or is there specifics somewhere in the spec that i missed

  correct = student, predicted = student, log-probability score = -55.6
  content = for the constructor packpackistream packinput do we allow to put cin as the parameter to be one test case

  correct = student, predicted = student, log-probability score = -187
  content = i am implementing the readpack function correct me if i am wrong but i was under the assumption that we dont use the pack scope resolution operator on this function since it is a private member function when i try to assign cards into the cards array it gives me the error cards was not declared in this scope since cards is a private member of the pack class shouldnt i be able to access this inside the function when i did use the scope resolution operator packreadpack the output of packpublictest was free invalid pointer and then a bunch of addresses

  correct = student, predicted = student, log-probability score = -132
  content = its stated in the project doc that several buggy implementations will be run to test the effectiveness of unit tests can the buggy implementation have different static variables defined in headers ex a different string or number for rankace or maxhands etc

  content = if the led card is ten of spades and trump is spades if player has in their hands queen of spades ace of spades jack of spades jack of clubs ten of diamonds they would play the ace of spades right because isnt it highest suit card even though jack of spades is technically the card of the highest value because it is the right bower

  correct = student, predicted = student, log-probability score = -67.3
  content = if led card for example is jack of diamonds and trump suit is hearts do we have a case here that led card suit is the same as trump suit or does led card suit act independently here

  correct = student, predicted = student, log-probability score = -148
  content = if we are making the human player how do we take into account for the screw the dealer part do we have to output something special stating that the human cannot type pass or is it expected they will not type pass if the trump making comes around to them the second round if so then that basically means there is no need for the input of the round variable into the function maketrump for the human

  correct = student, predicted = student, log-probability score = -178
  content = i just want to make sure if what i think of this particular situation in round 2 of making trump is right for example if the upcard is ten of hearts if the player has the cards nine of hearts jacks of spades king of spades king of clubs jack of diamonds they wont order up right because the jack of diamonds counts as a hearts suit and so because it is the left bower they are not allowed to order up the same suit as the upcard in round 2 so therefore maketrump would return false in this case right

  correct = student, predicted = student, log-probability score = -171
  content = im getting a segmentation fault when packpublictestcpp calls checkpack for defaultpack ive checked with cout statements that the other 2 packs are running through checkpack fine but the default one is where its failing im confused because all of my constructors for pack use readpack so i know that this function works as well what might be wrong with my default constructor for pack

  content = in the public test file for the pack functions our last assert statement for assertfirstcard cardcardrankqueen cardsuitspades is failing when we print what it thinks our actual firstcard is it says king of spades we think the issue is because the public test cases doesnt call packreset again between the two packdealone function calls so the second firstcard declaration is actually the second card could this be the case or have we made another error

  correct = student, predicted = student, log-probability score = -110
  content = generally i understand the purpose of a const function but why is maketrump const i am fairly certain that it does modify a member of the humanplayer class namely the hand since we must sort the hand before we print it to the user am i understanding this correctly

  correct = student, predicted = student, log-probability score = -143
  content = in the spec it says use these libraries iostream fstream cstdlib cassert cstring string array vector use the algorithmlibrary but only for the sortfunction however in the cardpublictestcpp they use include sstream to test the operator function are we allowed to use this library as well for our own test cases

  correct = student, predicted = student, log-probability score = -211
  content = in the specs it says that anytime screw the dealer is invoked the dealer declares trump to be the suit of the same color as the upcard does this mean he always makes trump the other suit of the same color or can he pick up the upcard the strategy in round two is that if the player has one face card of that suit he will order up my question is does this include the dealer if it reaches him should he still check to see if he has one face card of the same suit as upcard or should he just automatically make trump the opposite suit of the same color i hope this is clear but if i need to clarify the question i am happy to do so

  content = i know from the effects clause that the reset function is supposed to put the index back on the first card but is it supposed to do anything with the cards array say we call the shuffle function and then reset would this shuffle the cards and then once reset is called put the cards back to how they were before the shuffling or would reset just alter the index

  correct = student, predicted = student, log-probability score = -90.6

  correct = student, predicted = student, log-probability score = -87.9
  content = this may seem obvious but in c can you use functions declared later in the header file in a function declared above it eg could i use one of the bool functions in the cardh file in the implementation of the getsuit function in the cpp file

  content = are we always going to get the deck at 17 cards no matter if the deck has 24 or less than 24 cards ive been stuck on shuffling for a while and im pretty sure the reason im failing the public test for pack is that we deal a card before we shuffle so essentially we have to shuffle only 23 cards can we assume then even if we shuffle 23 cards we are cutting at 17 cards

  content = in things like suitnext what should we do in the case that suit does not equal one of the four valid suits can we just have an assert0 in that case and not need to return anything in the case that we must return a string i dont want to return garbage should i just have a else assert0 return garbage knowing the return will never get hit due to the assert in the general sense for all of these functions without requires clauses should we just assert0 if the output will be invalid

  correct = student, predicted = student, log-probability score = -279
  content = i understand by default the sort function takes in only the begin and end iterators and uses as the default comparison predicate but in one of the functions i find it particularly useful to use the cardless function as the comparator however the other version of sort function only takes in a binary predicate which is not the case for the two cardless functions because they take in trump andor ledcard as additional arguments what would be a correct way of using cardless together with sort i know it can be achieved using lambda expressions but that seems beyond the scope of this course can i still use them or should i instead just write my own sorting algorithm using loops etc

  correct = student, predicted = student, log-probability score = -108
  content = since in euchre the only time you would pick up and then discard a card is when being ordered up can we assume that the card being picked up const card upcard is of the trump suit from there we can then better determine which card to discard with having knowledge of trump thanks

  correct = student, predicted = instructor, log-probability score = -256
  content = the dealer then discards the lowest card in their hand counting the upcard for a final total of five cards from p4 specs page 6 third paragraph is this implying that we have the option to discard the card which is ordered up under extreme circumstances the rest of your hand would have to be trump higher than the card ordered up if so thats dumb thats against the rules of euchre i agree with dumbing down the strategy but this would be against the basic rules of euchre the reason you have to discard a card when ordered up is because you are forced to pick up the card which is ordered up

  content = hi i failed the boundary test for compute vertical cost matrix i was pretty shocked to see that at first then i go back to the specification then i guess what the problem happens here please correct me if i am wrong and close the discussion so in the specification i guess some people will be misled by this diagram so look at the boundary case here there are only 2 arrows coming from above the pixels at the last column but the above line says to get any pixel we have to come from one of the three pixels above it right ok here is what i thought in the left picture common case 3 arrows come from left just above and right in the right picture we expect to see the same thing but we cannot find the arrow from northeastern so according to my understanding probably some other students as well we consider 2 arrows coming above in the computation but it seems you want to see is this i mean if this is what we should do at the boundary case to fill the to get any pixel we have to come from one of the three pixels above it requirement you know isnt that wired in terms of a normal logic interpretation of the graph but i am not totally sure if this is what you really want i post it because i cannot think of any other problems that makes my code of this function fails thanks

  correct = student, predicted = student, log-probability score = -243
  content = im sort of confused as to how our algorithm is shuffling the deck of cards the dealer shuffles the deck at the beginning of each hand the algorithm we use for shuffling is a variant of the “one handed shuffle” cut the deck at 17 cards that is split the deck into two parts cards 0­16 and 17­23 and swap the two parts do this 3 times isnt the above implementation equivalent to just cutting the deck once i guess i dont understand where any of the shuffling is taking place besides a single cut equivalence

  correct = student, predicted = student, log-probability score = -183
  content = during round 2 it says a simple player will order up the suit with the same color as the upcard if they have one or more face cards of that suit in their hand for example if the simple player has jack of spades 10 of hearts 10 of diamonds king of diamonds king of hearts and the upcard is 10 of clubs would the jack of spades be considered as clubs considering the suit of upcard as trump suit since it will be the left bower and simple player passes since there is no card that has same color as clubs which is spades or would the jack of spades not be a left bower yet because trump suit is not really selected yet and simple player orders up since the simple player has a card with same color as clubs which is spades

  correct = student, predicted = student, log-probability score = -114
  content = the specification says to find the maximum energy so far and use it to fill in the border pixels does that mean for the first row the top one that all of pixels will have 0 energy since the matrix is initialized to all zeroes

  correct = student, predicted = student, log-probability score = -120
  content = is it acceptable if we tested the matrixinit and imageinit functions within tests for other functions eg width height print and did not have separate test cases for them but stated in the comments that the init functions were also being tested

  correct = student, predicted = student, log-probability score = -64.6

  correct = student, predicted = student, log-probability score = -254
  content = in order to respect the interface im using the matrixwidth and matrixheight functions in my computeenergymatrix function as follows int energyw matrixwidthenergy int energyh matrixheightenergy my matrixwidth function is an assert statement which is not causing problems and the following return mat width my processingcpp file fails the dog energy test and ive found that this is happening because energyw and energyh have the values 0 when i use energy width and energy height instead of energyw and energyh all of my tests pass does anyone know why my matrixwidth and matrixheight functions are failing

  correct = student, predicted = student, log-probability score = -110

  content = okay so the seam array is 1 2 2 2 1 correct so that means the second pixels of the first and last row and the third pixels of the second to fourth rows are to be removed when i work this out by hand i get top is originally passed in img bottom is theoretically correct image but the correct final image that im printing from processingtestscpp is why did the last three pixels of the last row just become zeroes

  correct = student, predicted = student, log-probability score = -103
  content = so processingtestscpp segfaults when i run it on the linux environment but it runs completely fine on visual studio not sure whats going on also resizecpp works on the linux environment so i dont think it would be a problem with my code would it

  correct = student, predicted = instructor, log-probability score = -109

  correct = student, predicted = student, log-probability score = -120
  content = do we necessarily have inefficiency or bugs in our code or could it also because the autograder cant process it besides i submitted at 430pm today and the autograder still has the public horse test when would it be removed thanks very much

  correct = student, predicted = student, log-probability score = -84.8

  correct = student, predicted = student, log-probability score = -195
  content = alright i know horses is not being used in pg3 however i dont interpret the meaning of resizecompilationcheck 00 what does 00 means i dont see whats the error neither besides i have passed all tests except processingpublichorse 01 and resizecompilationcheck00 and received a score of 78 soam i failing the resizecheck or any other thoughts thank

  correct = student, predicted = student, log-probability score = -88

  content = hi in 5e of our midterm whats wrong with the following code of library print for int i 0 i nummovies i movieprint libptr moviesi cout endl my thought is libptr is a pointer and in function movieprint it takes in a pointer as well so libptr moviesi gives as an address of the ith movie which means it should work

  correct = student, predicted = student, log-probability score = -276
  content = there are three rules for the command line arguments 1 there are 4 or 5 arguments including the executable name itself ie argv0 2 the desired width is less than or equal to the original width of the input image 3 the desired height is less than or equal to the original height of the input image i know the spec already specifies this but just to be clear do we always use the following lines when any rules are violated or we print different messages when different rules are violated for example when only the first rule is violated are we supposed to only print the first message or print the second message as well cout usage resizeexe infilename outfilename width height endl cout width and height must be less than or equal to original endl exitexitfailure

  content = the horses tests take quite a bit of time roughly 6 minutes for horses seam carve 300 382 and 8 minutes or so for 400 250 our matrixat uses no loop and no other functions use an unnecessary loop crabster and dog seam carves take no time at all but horses takes quite a bit is that a reasonable amount of time for the horses seam carve it passes all of the tests for horse eventually but just it takes a little time

  correct = student, predicted = instructor, log-probability score = -342
  content = when i run the processing tests my program quickly runs through the dog and crabster images however once it reaches the horses image the compute vertical cost matrix test takes forever and a half 3 minutes and the seam carve test does not finish within an hour therefore i found it safe to assume that my compute vertical cost matrix function is probably the problem however i tried to follow the guidelines of the specs initializing the cost matrix filling in its first row and then looping through the rest of the matrix using the matrixminvalueinrow function along with matrixat and i cannot think of any different way to attack this any help would be appreciated thanks

  correct = student, predicted = student, log-probability score = -227
  content = i dont really understand the logic behind the whole process of seam carve first you call seamcarvewidth which reduces the width by 1 then you call seamcarveheight which also calls seamcarvewidth and therefore reduces the width by 1 again which is actually the height because width is always reduced by 1 for dogppm all my other functions pass the tests but in seam carve my width ends up at 4 and height 4 when height should be 5 what am i missing here am i just calling something incorrectly in seam carve width

  correct = student, predicted = student, log-probability score = -425
  content = so im testing seamcarve right now and im coming around a strange that i honestly have no idea how to fix when running seam carve against the dog tests everything works perfectly however when i use it on crabster tests i get a seg fault i commented my code in both seam carve and seam carve width since this is where most of the work is done so i could see where the seg fault is happening in the screenshot of my terminal below 1 2 3 and 4 corresponds to my calls of computeenergy compute vertical cost find minimalcost and remove seam between steps 3 and 4 i print the height of the img being passed in dog test runs perfectly but when i get to crabster seg fault happens when i try to print the height of the img i put print statements in seam carve too orgi height of the img new height of what the picture is being changed to to see if height was being passed to seam carve width in the first place and it is im not sure why my seam carve width function isnt getting the height of my image for crabster since it does so for dog what do you think

  content = this become weird i think the way we initialize an image could be many possibilities there would be no differences between initialize with a pointer pointing to a image and initializing a actual image as long as we are consistent with using them correctly in later functions however when i am writing the removeverticalseam i was told to use an auxiliary image my logic of this function is initializing a smaller auximg and fill the image with the desired elements i copy all the original element in the img before the index in the seam and skip the index in the seam and copy the following elements in the original img by using nested for loop and two if branches and then i assign the auximg to the original img even though they have different size first i would like to make sure this logic is correct however my confusion is that when i initialize the auximg with a pointer and using the auximg whenever it requires a actual img and do the assigning like img auximg it stop compiling at the point imageinit function where assigning the wid parameter to the imgwidth when i initialize auximg with an actual img like image auximg and using auximg whenever it requires a pointer and do the assignment like img auximg it does not pass the given test it stop at the assertion line however it is really weird that when i change the assigning to img auximg it pass the test and seems like nothing wrong all the methods have same logic

  content = when testing my code i fail the testcost for crabster i used my output the correct output on diffchecker to see what the difference is and it looks like the differing values are the ones for the very last value in the row that sounds like an easy fix but these values only start to differ halfway into the test and all of the values before were the same im not sure what would be wrong to cause my cost function to not work properly halfway into the matrix but thats what diffchecker is telling me help heres a link to what im talking about if it helps

  correct = student, predicted = student, log-probability score = -95.1
  content = i think this is because we had two versions of matrixat one which returned a pointer to an int and one which returned a pointer to a constant int but which both had the same input parameters is there a way around this or am i just doing something wrong

  correct = student, predicted = student, log-probability score = -333
  content = no idea what to do here debugging has gotten me nowhere my program passes testing crabster seam carve 50x35 but for some reason fails the 70x35 test case this is not a problem with the dog tests this makes no sense to me at all how could all my functions pass up to this point work for all of dog work for the crabster 50x35 and then fall apart for the 70x35 not to mention the file is so big how could i possibly shift through the matrix and try to find the issue any advice or potential solutions would be appreciated as i have spent way to long trying to fix this note that i have already tried redownloading the starter files in case i accidentally changed something and this did not fix the problem thanks

  correct = student, predicted = student, log-probability score = -166
  content = how come i cannot instantiate an array with variable length even when i make that variable constant for example if i had a function int fnint which is a function that takes in an int and returns an int and i wanted to set the output of this function to the size of my array when i instantiate it i get an error saying that the expression must be constant i set a variable named size equal to the output of this function so const int size constfn5 int arraysize this will not work for some reason

  correct = student, predicted = student, log-probability score = -123
  content = can we create a function that calculates the minimum of two numbers i know we have to use matrixminvalueinrow but how do you use that if you are trying to find the cost of a pixel at the last column of a matrix because for that case if we did matrixminvalueinrow wouldnt we go out of bounds

  correct = student, predicted = student, log-probability score = -147
  content = im not quite sure how to convert my command line arguments into ints so that i can see if they fall within the requirements explicitly casting as an int causes an error in the g compiler conversion causes imprecision error or invalid staticcast type from char to int how can i go about this

  content = when width such as 0 is put in for resizeexe ie resizeexe dogppm dogtestppm 0 should the program fail at assertion of the functions that resizeexe uses or should resizeexe check it the specification only says resizeexe should check if the width is smaller than or equal original width

  correct = student, predicted = student, log-probability score = -192
  content = when i tried running my resizeexe against the ppm files that are given the code seem to work fine giving the correct ouput size when viewed in gimp however when i tried making my own ppm file and pass that into the program it always seem to give a segmentation fault this seem to occur when i try to initialize an image based of the ppm info from the file any ideas of what might be causing this

  correct = student, predicted = student, log-probability score = -78.7
  content = how can the assert fail for the rotate test for the crabster image but not for dogs if my image code was not correct for image wouldnt it also fail when the test ran for dogs as well

  correct = student, predicted = student, log-probability score = -62
  content = am i correct to understand that we have to create a blank ppm file to act as the output file before actually running the program thanks

  correct = student, predicted = student, log-probability score = -73.4
  content = the course states that if you fall within the standard deviation you will pass does that mean pass with a c or simple not fail d etc

  correct = student, predicted = student, log-probability score = -10.1
  content = thanks very much

  correct = student, predicted = student, log-probability score = -128
  content = for functions such as imagesetpixel and imagefill why are we actually sending a pixel rather than sending a pointer to a pixel i thought that for structs you are supposed to send an address and the parameter would require a pointer what the difference between the matrix image structs and the pixel structs

  correct = student, predicted = student, log-probability score = -168
  content = i searched and dont think this question has been asked yet in the example test function testprintbasic that was provided for us in imagetestscpp the code const pixel red 255 0 0 is used isnt this disrespecting the interface since its not using a function inside imagecpp and assuming that this is the right format to initialize the pixel

  correct = student, predicted = student, log-probability score = -337
  content = hello for question 4a i dont believe it said that we couldnt use an auxiliary array to pass in values before copying values etc so i was wondering why there is a specific grading criterion that tests for this while this isnt explicitly disallowed in the problem shouldnt it explicitly state that an auxiliary array is not allowed if the graders are to test 3 points worth for it i couldve easily not used an auxiliary array and i had even considered the idea but it wouldve taken more time to think through and wouldve introduced a higher probability of making an arithmetic mistake therefore i chose what worked with the least amount of thought while optimizing my time any info is appreciated thanks

  correct = student, predicted = student, log-probability score = -133
  content = in the function removeverticalseam it has the rme such as the size of seam is imageheightimg each element x in seam satisfies 0 x imagewidthimg how should i use assert to test this because i do not have access to the size of array or i can skip testing these two requirement

  correct = student, predicted = student, log-probability score = -398
  content = i am confused about how this function is tree recursive while funcd calls itself twice in its body the recursive calls do not create a wellformed binary tree for example in countingchange the problem was split into 2 smaller subproblems and combined them after computation by adding the results this creates a tree structure where at each node there is a left and right subtree representing recursive calls and the value of the node is obtained by combining the left and right results through addition in this function the recursive calls are nested so there is no such binary tree structure it is possible to create a tree for the problem but this tree is not a wellformed problem tree like the one above two function calls are made at each node but the result of one is dependent on the other so there is no true combination step and it is impossible to split the tree into two smaller independent subtrees looking back through notes and old materials tree recursion was never thoroughly defined in the way that tail recursion was is this analysis correct

  correct = student, predicted = instructor, log-probability score = -43.1

  content = the cstring header is not included as one of the libraries that we are allowed to use is it possible to still use cstrings without this header do we just traverse them as pointer arrays to chars what is the difference between a cstring used under this header file and one used without

  correct = student, predicted = student, log-probability score = -142
  content = just a clarification on how argc and argv function they are both automatically created when you execute a program that has been compiled with g and also automatically sent to your main function thus you can declare them as parameters in your main also when we write main without any parameters are argv and argc still passed on we just arent utilizing them thanks

  correct = student, predicted = student, log-probability score = -176
  content = when i was trying to test my work against the horse test case i have shifted the order the test is run putting the horse before the crabster and after the dog in the end i managed to get it to passed as well as the other two however when i revert to the original order it was in i suddenly fail the crabsters second seam carve test is there a reason why this is the case

  correct = student, predicted = instructor, log-probability score = -48.9

  content = hey yall so im having trouble with this function i run the tests and it simply says that it doesnt pass my code seems right to meanyone know some common mistakes with this or how to easily find the bug im setting the first row of cost then doing nested for loops with 3 different cases inside if along left wall if in middle if along right wallit seems pretty logical thanks

  correct = student, predicted = student, log-probability score = -234
  content = for this function when i am trying to find the energy for at a certain index and the pixel that is nesw is the border pixel do i calculate the value of that pixel too or should the value here be whatever the value of the index im at is for example if i had a matrix that is 4 x 4 and the computeenergy function was at 1 x 1the first index that isnt on the border of the matrix for the sq difference function would n and w be the border pixels or the pixel at 1 x 1 i know the spec says to compute for all non border pixels but im confused as to what i should be doing for the indexes next to them

  content = for removeverticalseam after i remove the seam in the auxiliary image can i use img aux rather than writing a loop to copy aux into img since img is a pointer i think it should work but actually it doesnt wondering why

  content = hi my partner and i have finished processingcpp and we are trying to test it right now it successfully tests dog crabster and up to horses remove seam when it gets to horses seam carve 300x382 however it simply freezes in runtime and never finishes in terminal i understand that horses is a big image and so it should take a while to process but it should still eventually finish any ideas on why this may be happening we are experiencing this problem locally with g for mac and on caen thanks

  correct = student, predicted = student, log-probability score = -86.8

  correct = student, predicted = student, log-probability score = -189
  content = i have finished writing my code and i kept testing my code for 4 hours for one reason i passed the all test cases for dogs and horses but i kept failing the cost calculation for crabster i tried to com up with the uniqueness of crabster file and write some function to come up with its uniqueness however i still dont understand why i passed the horse image but not crabster could some one give me the hint of crabster image uniqueness

  correct = student, predicted = student, log-probability score = -159
  content = we are having trouble with the seam carve width function it really feels like we have to use recursion it also feels really tedious making each variable into a constant after its corresponding function call what are we doing wrong do we have to make a new image instance each time we take our a seam until we get the desired width

  correct = student, predicted = instructor, log-probability score = -26.3
  content = thank you for the 90 year extension

  correct = student, predicted = student, log-probability score = -90.3

  correct = student, predicted = student, log-probability score = -126
  content = how is the computeenergymatrix supposed to work if it is passed a 2 x 2 image as there is no center value you cant use north south east and west to calculate what it should be we will just not be passed an image this small thanks

  correct = student, predicted = student, log-probability score = -173
  content = how should we compute the vertical cost if the entire row has the same value for example every pixel in the bottom row of the matrix energy has the same value and the minimum cost in the row above is 960 since 960 is right in the middle of a 5x5 matrix there are 3 possible pixels below that would return the same cost so how should we determine which one to use

  correct = student, predicted = student, log-probability score = -195
  content = while trying to initialize seam in the seamwidthcarve function i am running into the compiler not letting use an expression that does not have a const value for the size of the array i have declared a const int variable to hold the result of imageheightimg to no avail how do i create the appropriate size array using the imageheight function i am using visual studio which from looking up has some problems with this httpstackoverflowcomquestions18919647declaringanarrayusingconstinteger thanks

  correct = student, predicted = student, log-probability score = -97.3

  correct = student, predicted = student, log-probability score = -311
  content = hi i just checked the email and found that i got 067 for project 2 i felt there might be something wrong since i had my code complied in the terminal and all the tests were passed i went back to the autograder and i found there were two submissions for project 2 the first one was mine and the second one was my partners which showed invalid because he didnt submit the test file is that why im getting 0 because my partner forgot to submit his testing file and did you grade only the last submission of both partners instead of grading the file individually i didnt remember i heard anything like we should only submit once and we would be graded based on the same file like in 183 we were told we could write the code together but we had to write our code individually

  correct = student, predicted = student, log-probability score = -138
  content = at this point i have implemented the computeenergymatrix function when i tried testing it with the given processingtest file i immediately get a segmentation fault when running the exe is this because i havent implemented the other functions yet when i tried commenting out the function as well as the squareddifference one given the segmentation fault still remains thanks

  correct = student, predicted = student, log-probability score = -79.6

  correct = student, predicted = student, log-probability score = -33.6
  content = do we have to index by pointer or can i index with something like arrayi

  correct = student, predicted = student, log-probability score = -208
  content = i am confused as to the definition of border pixels may we take the phrase to mean all pixels in the first and last row and first and last column of the image if so how would the function computeenergymatrix be used if given for example a 1x5 image would all pixels be counted as border pixels and thus ignored or would only the end pixels be counted as border pixels similarly if given a 2x7 image would we ignore all pixels as the only two rows and columns would be the first and last rows and columns or would we scan the second row excluding those pixels in the first and last column

  correct = student, predicted = student, log-probability score = -117
  content = the rme of this function says column 1 is inclusive while column 2 is exclusive does that mean we can never check the whole row because the last element will always be excluded what if the min value is on the last column of a row how would i find this

  correct = student, predicted = student, log-probability score = -144
  content = in the energy matrix function it says to initialize the energy matrix to be the same size as the given image in order to initialize the matrix we must know the width and height of the image is it safe to assume that in the test cases the image is initialized with a height and width i did not find any imageinit functions in the processingtestscpp so how do we know if the given image will have a provided width and height

  correct = student, predicted = instructor, log-probability score = -176
  content = in the spec it explains how to remove the seam by copying all but the seam into another image then copying it back since you cannot change the height or width of an existing image since the height and width will remain the same that means we will need to fill that column with some sort of values then right what should we but putting at the end of the image in order to satisfy this thanks

  content = hey guys i have a question about how to test the function matrixat since we are not recommended to acquire the elements directly by using the dot operator how could we ensure that the matrixat gives us a pointer that points to the right element

  correct = student, predicted = student, log-probability score = -112
  content = i tried testing a 2x2 matrix in the third imageinit and the matrixnormalize function is giving me really weird numbers for example when have a 2x2 matrix and filled it with 0 the normalized matrix returns with huge negative numbers

  correct = student, predicted = student, log-probability score = -58.7
  content = does the code for the checkpoint need to be fully commented to receive style points fort the checkpoint submission for project 3

  correct = student, predicted = student, log-probability score = -128
  content = hi i have received this error when running it thru cywin this variable has actually been used in a loop to contain the column value as well as being returned as column value for the function i am not sure why it said set but not used how should i solve this problem when it is in fact used thanks

  correct = student, predicted = student, log-probability score = -67.3
  content = when i am testing the function int matrixmaxconst matrix mat it requires a const matrix so how do i declare a const matrix i tried const matrix mat and matrix const mat but neither works

  correct = student, predicted = student, log-probability score = -21.5
  content = are we allowed to use constcast in our code

  correct = student, predicted = student, log-probability score = -64.6
  content = do we need to protect against invalid ppm input for example p3 1 1 255 255 255 255 0 0 0 or p3 2 2 255 0 0

  correct = student, predicted = student, log-probability score = -125
  content = for the matrixcolumnofminvalueinrow function the rme has a condition of 0 columnstart columnend matrixwidthmat if a matrix has a width of 5 the columns will be indexed from 0 to 4 so how can columnend be equal to matrixwidth which is 5 shouldnt it be columnend matrixwidth

  correct = student, predicted = student, log-probability score = -45.9
  content = confused on how to return a pixel for this function how do create the pixel that will have values set to be returned for the function

  correct = student, predicted = student, log-probability score = -102
  content = i think i read about this somewhere either on the specs or piazza but i cant find it anymore are we allowed to set matrices to each other say i assign imgredchannel mat would that be allowed

  correct = student, predicted = student, log-probability score = -117
  content = i tried debugging using cout statements in my test functions to resolve the segmentation error i cout a string in the very first line of one of my test functions but it still gives me a segmentation error for that particular function the function that im testing is the second initialization function in imagetestscpp can someone please help me out

  correct = student, predicted = student, log-probability score = -256
  content = i keep having an issue where im able to compile and run imagepublictest on my own with all of the tests passing but every time i submit to the autograder it claims that the return code is incorrect just to be sure i tried submitting on different computers setting the stack size limit to 60000 and even compiling on caen right now i am on caen linux the public test for image compiles and runs fine when i set the stack size limit to 60000 but even if i run firefox through terminal to access the autograder the submission still fails the imagepublictest with return code incorrect and no other useful information what am i doing wrong

  correct = student, predicted = student, log-probability score = -120
  content = inside the test case functions for image is there any way we can call matrixat we cant use dot operator when passing members of imgie redchannel because test case functions are outside the module right or is it just not possible to use matrixat here

  correct = student, predicted = student, log-probability score = -292
  content = i have searched piazza a bunch of times and found that it is okay to use multiple functions in the same test case if they test the same behavior but i am confused of what a single behavior would be for example for testing matrixprint i would need to use matrixat or matrixfill to change values so would this test then test both of these functions if so does this constitute as testing the same behavior i would also like some clarification as to when it is appropriate to use functions to test each other and when it will cause your code to not work it does not make sense to me how i can use matrixat to test matrixat if that is the function i am testing and yes i have searched piazza and still do not understand how this can be valid is there a way to define what is meant by single behavior in a test i just dont want to use the functions i wrote too often in my test cases because it makes me feel uneasy about them

  correct = student, predicted = student, log-probability score = -73.8
  content = this may sound basic but how do you compile our files to test with the publictest files instead of the actual test cases we created through caen linux

  correct = student, predicted = student, log-probability score = -175
  content = i dont really understand in matrixrow how to access ptr in order to extract the row of the specific element in the matrix and then do basically the same thing for column while using the same variableptr im pretty sure my matrixat is working properly but when i debug in the public test ptr 0x7fff5fb0b604 and ptr 255 i dont know what im doing wrong or how to access two different variables from ptr

  correct = student, predicted = instructor, log-probability score = -187
  content = im working in xcode and my program is running extremely slow and xcode is often freezing ive never had this issue before and dont think it is my computer i set a breakpoint and looked into the data of my matrix and there is values for all 250000 spaces some zeros and some junk could having this massive data structure be the reason for my issues thank you

  correct = student, predicted = student, log-probability score = -57.6
  content = i got a error message saying that your program exceeded the time limit and was terminated what does this mean

  correct = student, predicted = student, log-probability score = -133
  content = my partner and i made a ppm file 500x500 to test image init then we realized that the autograder wont be able to use that file so which file should we use for a stressboundary case horses even though it wont be the max height and width

  correct = student, predicted = student, log-probability score = -99.2
  content = hello can we access an element in data by index as following matdatai or do we have to access the element in data in a matrix by pointer only matdata i if either is fine is the second one considered better style thanks

  correct = student, predicted = student, log-probability score = -77.1
  content = suppose that the normalization of the matrix is not an integral value what should i have the pixel output be ie do i have it round to the nearest int

  correct = student, predicted = student, log-probability score = -63.6
  content = specifically for the third initialize function can we assume that all colorchannels and the mat matrice are the same size

  correct = student, predicted = student, log-probability score = -69.2
  content = should we reset matrices back to all 0s after testing so the memory values are back to rather than leaving the junk in the memory

  correct = student, predicted = student, log-probability score = -132
  content = in imagepublictests the imageinitimg mat function is tested by pixel gray 51c 51c 51c assertpixelequalimagegetpixelimg 0 c gray what does the 51c mean how are you able to check that a certain pixel is gray if they are all varying degrees of gray

  correct = student, predicted = student, log-probability score = -216
  content = so in the specifications it says to be assertive as in to add assertions inside the code implementations for the various matrixcpp and imagecpp functions is the purpose of this to help us debug our programs in case we run into a issue while writing test functions or is it required because the autograder will test for cases that violate the require clause i thought we werent supposed to test for invalid input and that it was ok to assume that the conditions in the required section would not be violated

  correct = student, predicted = student, log-probability score = -194
  content = so ive been trying to initialize this image right but ive been using a matrix filled with all zeros when i call the normalize function during initialization the function cant hang bruh it tries to divide each value by the max value of the matrix but the problem is the max is zero dawg should we be asserting that the matrix isnt entirely filled with zeros modify the normalize function or what im so lost yo

  correct = student, predicted = student, log-probability score = -47.1
  content = i and another group am getting this error message on the checkpoint on auto grader right now

  correct = student, predicted = student, log-probability score = -107
  content = in matrixprint wherever it is supposed to print a 0 it prints out a number greater than 30000 in the test case that we made while we are able to get around that by saying if the element in the matrix is greater than 30000 print 0 the element in the matrix should not be greater than 30000 it should be 0 what is happening

  correct = student, predicted = student, log-probability score = -202
  content = i have some questions regarding testing 1is it generally okay for us to use other functions in the same module as helper functions to test a specific function like using matrixfillor more to test matrixat 2 can we use matrix functions in the testing of some image functions 3do we still need to write our testing for matrixfill and imageprint since free ones are already given 4can we use multiple asserts in one function

  correct = student, predicted = student, log-probability score = -81.3
  content = is it ok if partner uniqnames are not put on the top of the files i shall put them but just wanted to know in case i forget sometime in the future

  correct = student, predicted = student, log-probability score = -103
  content = for this function i know we are supposed to normalize mat to maxintensity but are we supposed to assign the values in mat to the red green and blue channels so that all three of the channels are identical to each other

  correct = student, predicted = instructor, log-probability score = -247
  content = hi when working to test my imagecpp specifically the set pixel function this error got thrown at me in the terminal to share more detail and i believe this should be in the clear w honor code i initialized a matrix w imageinitimg 3 3 and the error occured when calling imagesetpixelimg 1 1 blue my understanding of the error is that it is due to stack overflow or calling something out of memeory but i believe i should have done neither here any suggestionsfixs for others that have run into this thx

  correct = student, predicted = student, log-probability score = -49.5
  content = within matrixcpp can the operator be used to access data or this considered disrespecting the interface

  correct = student, predicted = student, log-probability score = -157
  content = having some issues with the third imageinit function how i understand it is we need to normalize the values in the matrix passed to us and then assign those values into red green and blue chanel in img to do so should we be making a copy of the values in mat its a const so we cant call the normalize function on it

  correct = student, predicted = instructor, log-probability score = -105
  content = is there incentive to submit to the autograder again before the checkpoint deadline if i have a 44 on my last submission improvements that i would make between now and then would be some style corrections and additional test cases

  correct = student, predicted = student, log-probability score = -179
  content = when it says in the requires clauses that something points to a matrix basically for all the init functions which dont have pointers that point to valid matricesimages that means if i were to assert it it would return false and throw an error right im guessing that since the nonvalid matricesimages have not been properly initialized theres just junk saved in them is my thinking correct on this

  correct = student, predicted = student, log-probability score = -237
  content = i have a function void test image img cout test endl that causes this stack overflow error exception thrown at 0x011ecc89 in project3exe 0xc00000fd stack overflow parameters 0x00000000 0x00092000 unhandled exception at 0x011ecc89 in project3exe 0xc00000fd stack overflow parameters 0x00000000 0x00092000 the program 6236 project3exe has exited with code 0 0x0 it runs fine when i comment out the image img line im not sure how to go about this isnt it simple declaring an image using the struct from the header file that was provided to us

  correct = student, predicted = student, log-probability score = -34.4
  content = what does this array normalize to 0 1 2 3 4 5

  correct = student, predicted = student, log-probability score = -136
  content = i check if matrixatmat row column matrixatmat 0 0 equals to the desired distance so to speak but this way im using matrixat to test itself would it be acceptable i cant think of any other ways to test it because were not allowed to access data thanks very much

  correct = student, predicted = student, log-probability score = -95.7
  content = so for this test in publictest assertactual outputcorrect i printed out both actual and outputcorrect and got this p3 2 2 255 255 0 0 0 255 0 0 0 255 255 255 255 p3 2 2 255 255 0 0 0 255 0 0 0 255 255 255 255 yet i failed this assertion how does this work out

  correct = student, predicted = instructor, log-probability score = -345
  content = i have encountered a very odd problem with my imageprint function posted below is the output on the terminal that i get i have an input stream which i print as correct the following couts are sent from the matrixinit function this shows that the values are correctly initialized under printing are couts from matrixprint even though all im doing is dereferencing matrixat to obtain the values at the row column specified as printed its producing the wrong values another interesting tidbit is that it worked with the given test function testprintbasic any idea as to whats gone wrong thanks correct p3 3 2 255 255 0 0 0 255 0 1 2 3 0 0 255 255 255 255 4 5 6 matrixinit red channel value at 0 0 is 255 green channel value at 0 0 is 0 blue channel value at 0 0 is 0 red channel value at 0 1 is 0 green channel value at 0 1 is 255 blue channel value at 0 1 is 0 red channel value at 0 2 is 1 green channel value at 0 2 is 2 blue channel value at 0 2 is 3 red channel value at 1 0 is 0 green channel value at 1 0 is 0 blue channel value at 1 0 is 255 red channel value at 1 1 is 255 green channel value at 1 1 is 255 blue channel value at 1 1 is 255 red channel value at 1 2 is 4 green channel value at 1 2 is 5 blue channel value at 1 2 is 6 now printing p3 3 2 255 red channel value at 0 0 is 255 green channel value at 0 0 is 0 blue channel value at 0 0 is 0 red channel value at 0 1 is 0 green channel value at 0 1 is 255 blue channel value at 0 1 is 0 red channel value at 0 2 is 1 green channel value at 0 2 is 2 blue channel value at 0 2 is 3 red channel value at 1 0 is 1 green channel value at 1 0 is 2 blue channel value at 1 0 is 3 red channel value at 1 1 is 0 green channel value at 1 1 is 0 blue channel value at 1 1 is 255 red channel value at 1 2 is 255 green channel value at 1 2 is 255 blue channel value at 1 2 is 255

  correct = student, predicted = student, log-probability score = -81.1
  content = it happened when i used the make command also we only have to write imagecpp and matrixcpp right why is processingtestcpp and processingcpp in the makefile command thank you

  correct = student, predicted = student, log-probability score = -108
  content = so i printed matrixprintmat ssoutput and asserted for equality with a string thats exactly the same including whitespace as the matrixprint but it still says theres an error what am i doing wrong

  correct = student, predicted = student, log-probability score = -90.3
  content = why my xcode only shows number of compile errors on the upper right side instead of showing it on each line when i write code also it corrects no spelling errors

  correct = student, predicted = instructor, log-probability score = -56.6
  content = for some reason the autograder thinks that the deadline for the project 3 checkpoint has passed and is not letting me submit

  correct = student, predicted = student, log-probability score = -54.3
  content = i just tried to submit to the autograder and received the message error the deadline for this project has passed not sure why its doing this

  correct = student, predicted = student, log-probability score = -254
  content = in imagepublictest we have the following code ignore that f3 in cout if im not mistaken the portion where it says a very poorly behaved ppm should result in a assert fail this means that the image img still has the same dimensions as when it was first initialized 3 4 this is resulting in my code throwing up faulty output for the should be well behaved since img hasnt been reinitialized since is this intended to happen if so how would i go about circumventing this thanks

  correct = student, predicted = student, log-probability score = -136
  content = for the implementation of the first imageinit do we specifically have to create the three channel matrices or do we just have to initialize it i tried just initializing the channels using the matrixinit without creating the matrices themselves but have been getting the error colorchannel was not declared in this scope thanks

  correct = student, predicted = student, log-probability score = -79
  content = do we necessarily have to test functions like imageheight or matrixwidth or do we need to test all functions by default it just seems that some functions would be unreasonable to test extensively

  correct = student, predicted = student, log-probability score = -112
  content = should we consider cases where input pixels exceed the maxintensity of imageh for example if we used setpixel to enter a pixel of r 300 should we assert for that condition

  correct = student, predicted = student, log-probability score = -150
  content = when i test matrixat i may use matrixfill to first fill some elements i am assuming my matrixfill works without bugs when i test matrixfill i may use matrixat to do assert i am assuming my matrixat works without bugs however there must be an order to test these 2 functions whether i test matrixat first or matrixfill first but at the first i trust my other function to be true even i havent got a chance to test it is this allowed to happen in testing

  correct = student, predicted = instructor, log-probability score = -125
  content = so for the 3rd image init what exactly is the interaction between the matrix and the image doesnt the image already hold 3 matrices for the r g and blue values can we just fill these matrices with max intensities what is the need for another matrix

  correct = student, predicted = student, log-probability score = -132
  content = for some reason i get my return code as incorrect when i ran my code through autograder for the matrixpublictest when i ran the file through caen using make it didnt give me any complier errors for matrixpublictest i even tried using make clean but it still ran perfectly fine is the matrixpublic test on the autograder different from the one given to us

  correct = student, predicted = student, log-probability score = -128
  content = i know someone asked this question earlier however no response was given for the checkpoint it was mentioned that only the public tests cases would be checked by the autograder is this to suggest that our checkpoint grade will equal our autograder grade just trying to get some clarification on this thank you very much

  correct = student, predicted = student, log-probability score = -61.7
  content = imagepublictestcpp calls a pixelequal function does this mean we have to right one even though it is not in the h file and is not a helper function

  correct = student, predicted = student, log-probability score = -124
  content = i am trying to test the function const int matrixat const matrix mat int row int column but i do not know how to declare a const matrix since we cannot use matrixinit after declaring a const matrix in order to call this function we need a pointer to a const matrix right may i know how i could overcome this problem thank you

  correct = student, predicted = student, log-probability score = -62
  content = not sure if im interpreting this correctly but is autograder telling me matrixh doesnt exist should it not be included in matrixtestscpp

  correct = student, predicted = student, log-probability score = -88.3
  content = is it ok if we include two functions in the same test case for example it makes sense to have a single test case for both matrixheight and matrixwidth rather than testing them in separate functions

  correct = student, predicted = student, log-probability score = -147
  content = i realized that my testing of the width height and imageinit with width and height as parameters will basically all be the exact same code as to test the init function i use the getwidth and getheight functions would it be sufficient to test all three of these functions in one test function or should i find another way to test them separately

  correct = student, predicted = student, log-probability score = -27.4
  content = are we allowed to add any include to any of the cpp files that we write

  correct = student, predicted = student, log-probability score = -74.4
  content = this is the last test function i am writing but imageinit has an error in this one single test function it works in all other tests except this one and i have no idea what the problem is here

  correct = student, predicted = student, log-probability score = -62.2
  content = how do we access the member variable of a pixel i tried using pixel r base operand of has nonpointer type pixel

  correct = student, predicted = student, log-probability score = -133
  content = hi im having trouble figuring out how to to use matrixrow in the third image initialization i currently want to use a for loop but matrixrow requires a ptr to constant int and i dont know how to have that happen while still in a for loop any suggestions am i not on the right track with using matrixrow inside for loop thanks

  correct = student, predicted = student, log-probability score = -161
  content = my test for matrixrow is failing i know my matrixat functions work so i created a pointer using matrixat to point to the 14th element in the matrix i created in my test function then i called matrixrow with that matrix and that pointer i traversed through data comparing the address of each element in data to the pointer i printed out each of the addresses and none of them match that of the pointer even though the address of the 14th element and the pointer which points to the 14th element should be the same im not sure what the problem is

  correct = student, predicted = student, log-probability score = -82.7
  content = if they dont have a default value which is empty the following way of testing should cause trouble for we dont know whats in ssoutput before or after imageprint is called

  correct = student, predicted = student, log-probability score = -82.9
  content = i am confused as to how to use the normalize function given to us because the imageinit function gives us a const matrix so we cant use it as input to the given normalize function also maxintensity is also const so we cant use that with normalize either

  correct = student, predicted = student, log-probability score = -263
  content = for testing the imagecpp file ive found that i use many of the image functions to set up images for my test cases for example in the imageinit test functions ive been using setpixel fill and the other init functions to create images to compare to the image created by the function test being implemented so for the init that passes a matrix as a parameter i create two images one using that function specifically and one using a different init function and manually filling the image using other means to create an exact copy of what should be created by just using the one init function the reason i think this may be an issue is that technically im using some functions before running the test for it and regardless of the order i run my tests in this will still happen is that okay

  correct = student, predicted = student, log-probability score = -67.5
  content = how do i convert a string to istream that i am able to use for a ppm file as a paramerter for initializing image

  correct = student, predicted = student, log-probability score = -37.9
  content = should the color channels have the same dimensions as the image

  correct = student, predicted = student, log-probability score = -38.3
  content = is the width and height of matrix equivalent to the width and height of image

  correct = student, predicted = student, log-probability score = -32.9
  content = do we need to test normalize for matrix thanks saul

  correct = student, predicted = instructor, log-probability score = -27.2
  content = i assume there would be no office hours on spring break

  correct = student, predicted = student, log-probability score = -103
  content = i have several questions about rme and unit tests 1 do we need to write unit test for matrixnormalize since it is provided 2 do we need to include rme for unit tests 3 are we allowed to write functions to help the unit tests ie print things if so do we need rme for them thank you

  correct = student, predicted = student, log-probability score = -58.1
  content = has nonpointer type matrix this error came up when i tried to access the data array of a matrix not sure why i cant

  correct = student, predicted = student, log-probability score = -145
  content = im trying to test my second init function using the string stream im trying to get the dimensions of the image as well as the rgb values for each of the pixels do i use toyviewer to do that because we are going to have to hard code the dimensions of a ppm image to see if our function worked right how exactly do i get the dimensions and values using toyviewer

  correct = student, predicted = student, log-probability score = -77.9
  content = can we normalize a matrix to a negative value or negative maximum if so the steps given to find the normalized value will no longer be applicable

  correct = student, predicted = instructor, log-probability score = -93.1
  content = if we are unable to attend the review session on saturday will it be recorded and will any solutions be posted so we can check some of the problems we did this would be very helpful for studying purposes for those who cant make it

  correct = student, predicted = student, log-probability score = -45.1
  content = just want to make sure we only get pass or fail on labs we would not be graded on labs correct

  correct = student, predicted = instructor, log-probability score = -73.1
  content = last week we got an announcement saying that only the public test cases are run for the checkpoint does this mean that the score we see from the autograder is our score for the project checkpoint

  correct = student, predicted = student, log-probability score = -312
  content = hi i was trying to test imagecpp however i encountered the problem that in this public test case the previously initiated img 3x4 is reused for a smaller img of 2x2 so some of the values from 3x4 reamains in img 904 a professor mentioned that reset matrix to zero is fine for test case but what about in the imginit functions themselves are theythose corresponding rgb channels supposed to be initializedreset to zero at first then take care of the values that the user want to initialized in case the img is going to be reused sorry for my unorganized way of asking this question i hope it is understandable thanks

  correct = student, predicted = student, log-probability score = -74.4
  content = just to clarify for this example 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 matrix width would return 3 and matrix height would return 3 correct

  correct = student, predicted = student, log-probability score = -49.7
  content = since matrixnormalize is already provided for us ie we didnt write it do we still have to write test cases for it

  correct = student, predicted = instructor, log-probability score = -128
  content = the autograder gave me feedback for my first few tries in like a minute but my latest submission is still going and its been 40 minutes im wondering what might be the problem because its not like last time when so many people were submitting near the deadline

  correct = student, predicted = student, log-probability score = -114
  content = hello i am testing the imageinitimage img const matrix mat function in the function when i call matrixnormalize it is turning a 1x1 matrix with value 0 into a 1x1 matrix with value 2147483648 does anyone know why this is happening thanks

  correct = student, predicted = student, log-probability score = -238
  content = how can we develop a test case for this 3rd imageinit function looking at the public test case it multiplies the original value in the matrix by 51 for the grey pixel and then checks each pixel is this how we are supposed to test if so what am i missing about the 51 my other thought is to normalize the matrix in the test function and then somehow compare that normalized matrix to each element in red green and blue of the image however this is following essentially the same logic used in the imageinit function itself so isnt that a bad test

  correct = student, predicted = student, log-probability score = -54.4
  content = how can we test these functions if our only method of filling the data array is with using matrixfill

  correct = student, predicted = student, log-probability score = -89.8
  content = i submitted my cpp files to the autograder to see how much i would get but the status just says received its not even pending and shows no result is there something wrong with the autograder or is this just me

  correct = student, predicted = student, log-probability score = -152
  content = how do you test for the void imageinitimage img stdistream is can i make my own ppm in the test function and use that to test the imageinit quite confused here since ill only submit the imagecpp and imagetestcpp to the autograder along with matrixcpp and matrixtestcpp and wont submit any ppm files

  correct = student, predicted = student, log-probability score = -109
  content = im a bit confused about the format of the rgb data for this function i know that for each pixel the rgb values are the same but does the matrix that is passed in have a copy of this value for each channel in each pixel similar to the format of a ppm file thanks

  correct = student, predicted = student, log-probability score = -62.1
  content = what is the difference between stringstream and istringstreamostringstream can stringstream serve as both istringstream and ostringstream

  correct = student, predicted = student, log-probability score = -96.3
  content = how do i interpret these results what does it mean by return code did the output just not match the correct output do we have access to a correct output txt file for the sake of diff checking any help would be appreciated

  correct = student, predicted = student, log-probability score = -97.4
  content = for the second imageinit the one that has istream is as a parameter do we need to initialize redchannel greenchannel and bluechannel or do we just need to initialize width and height

  correct = student, predicted = student, log-probability score = -192
  content = my partner and i are having some trouble with the second imageinit function that takes in an istream we think we need to open some ppm file and read in the values to the respective red green or blue channel matrix sort of like the way we read in from a file on the last lab if thats the case how do we know the filename to read from is that something to do with the pointer to an image passed as an argument

  correct = student, predicted = student, log-probability score = -112
  content = can we assume that the three ints in the pixel struct will always be between 0 and 255 it doesnt say anything about it in the rme so do we need to account for cases where one of the ints in the pixel gets a value outside that range

  correct = student, predicted = student, log-probability score = -44.5
  content = is the checkpoint going to be graded for style or this that something we can adhere to afterwards

  correct = student, predicted = student, log-probability score = -154
  content = im having trouble implementing imageinit in order to initialize the red green and blue channels i have to use matrixinit to create 3 matrices but i keep getting an error telling me that there is no matching function call for matrixinit i have already completed all of the matrix function implementations and they are working

  correct = student, predicted = student, log-probability score = -74.1
  content = i searched and reread the specs but i wanted to be clear a matrix can hold any integers so does that mean negative and positive too

  correct = student, predicted = student, log-probability score = -115
  content = for the free test case that was given testinitbasic the comments say that they initialized a 3x5 matrix but the width is 3 and height is 5 should it not be row by column so that it is a 5x3 matrix

  correct = student, predicted = student, log-probability score = -166
  content = i have a weird problem when testing imagesetpixel if i do imagesetpixelimg 0 0 red then the pixel on row0 column0 is 255 0 0 but if i then do imagesetpixelimg 1 0 green then the pixel on row1 column0 is 0 255 0 and the pixel on row0 column0 also changed to 0 255 0 as well i dont know why this happen anyone met the same problem or have any idea whats wrong with the code

  correct = student, predicted = student, log-probability score = -309
  content = im still very confused about the ppm are files like dogcostcorrecttxt and horsecostcorrecttxt in the starter files ppm if so why they are not in the correct format for example the following is what dogcostcorrecttxt contains it has width and height in the first line however where do p3plain ppm file and 225max value for rgb go also if the rgb value is 1470 for a pixel how do i determine what its individual elementredgreenblue is it seems like there are more than one combinations for example in this case red can be 1 green 47 and blue 0 it can also be interpreted as red 14 green 7 blue 0 so how can i tell which combination is true

  correct = student, predicted = student, log-probability score = -201
  content = effects initializes the image to be a normalized grayscale representation of the data stored in the matrix that is the values in the matrix are normalized to maxintensity and then used to initialize the red green and blue components of each pixel in the image does this mean the values are already normalized or do we need to normalize them by multiplying by 255 before assigning them to the color channels

  correct = student, predicted = student, log-probability score = -159
  content = for the function void imageinitimage img int width int height we are trying to create a test case we are trying to check that the matrix redchannel bluechannel and greenchannel now have the given width and height but we cant figure out how to write code without directly accessing member data by using imgredchannel

  correct = student, predicted = student, log-probability score = -114
  content = are we supposed to have test functions that directly test imageinit or do we just test imageprint imagewidth imageheight imagegetpixel imagesetpixel and imagefill because to be used they would need to initialize the image

  correct = student, predicted = student, log-probability score = -76.9
  content = because i cannot access a matrixs data variable directly from an outside file can i add in functions to imagecpp in order to work around this problem

  correct = student, predicted = student, log-probability score = -382
  content = i want to confirm that my idea of a ppm image is correct specifically i want to better understand how pixels and the color channels relate assume we have 3x3 ppm image it is solid green except for a vertical red line running down top to the bottom like this if we were to initialize this image using the image struct it would have the following values image width 3 height 3 redchannel matrix width 3 height 3 data 25500 25500 25500 greenchannel matrix width 3 height 3 data 0255255 0255255 0255255 bluechannel matrix width 3 height 3 data 000 000 000 also to represent a specific pixel of my image we would pick the rgb values from the same specified position in each of the color channel matrices for example the pixel in the first column and row would be represented by 25500 is my understanding correct thanks

  correct = student, predicted = student, log-probability score = -64.1
  content = i pass all the asserts but im fairly sure what i print is wrong 3rd row has 6 elements instead of 5

  correct = student, predicted = student, log-probability score = -128
  content = for imageinitimage img stdistream is and imageinitimage img const matrix mat i have not initialized rbg matrices so it should have no width nor height but i am able to assign values from is or mat how is this possible

  correct = student, predicted = student, log-probability score = -134
  content = hi i was debugging using labster and the code works fine on g but in labster it tells me that theres a syntax error on the line where i make the declaration stringstream ss however when i include sstream it tells me that include is not supported at the moment what do i do to test my code on labster thanks

  content = for example a nonempty matrix mat beginbmatrix 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 endbmatrix that is passed to the function void matrixcopyconst matrix mat matrix temp mat matrix copy temp matrixprintcopy i keep getting an assertion fail stating that the height and the width of copy is 0

  correct = student, predicted = student, log-probability score = -105
  content = for one of the imageinit functions the requires clauses states that 0 width maxmatrixwidth and 0 height maxmatrixheight should we check these conditions with asserts and if so how do we access maxmatrixheight and maxmatrixwidth

  correct = student, predicted = student, log-probability score = -79.5
  content = i just wanted to clarify that the imageprint function only needs to modify the ostream in the arguments it does not need to display a ppm image correct

  correct = student, predicted = student, log-probability score = -40.6
  content = or we have to traversal by pointer only when dealing with arrays thanks very much

  correct = student, predicted = instructor, log-probability score = -229
  content = in terms of testing setpixel and getpixel i am having a hard time figuring out different way to test them both in both you must initialize an image set some pixels then get some pixels i am tempted to copy and paste my test from set pixel to get pixel i assume that is not sufficient the only other thought i am having is to fill and image then get a pixel then change that pixel then get the pixel again but that would again be essentially the same for both test and set pixel any thoughts or are these tests as coupled and redundant as they seem

  correct = student, predicted = student, log-probability score = -50.1
  content = this is one of requires clauses for imageinit i am not sure what this exactly means and how i am supposed to check it

  correct = student, predicted = student, log-probability score = -116
  content = for the cases when there are already some member functions that provide the information we need for example in matrixprint can we directly access the width and height of the object or we have to call matrixwidth and matrixheight thanks very much

  correct = student, predicted = student, log-probability score = -87.4

  correct = student, predicted = student, log-probability score = -112
  content = although it is required that width and height to be greater than 0 by the rme are we guaranteed that the autograder will not test for a 0 width or a 0 height matrix i am concerned because one of the functions will fail since i cant divide by 0

  correct = student, predicted = student, log-probability score = -128
  content = im creating a while loop for this function i want the while loop to stop once my pointer is lower than matdata but is it always guaranteed that there will be memory below the array in other words is it valid to check if an address is lower than the address of the 0th index of data

  correct = student, predicted = student, log-probability score = -111
  content = i didnt see it stated either way in the spec and since every other function is pretty much dependent on it wondered if we needed dedicated test cases in matrixtestscpp it is tricky to test without being dependent on itself

  correct = student, predicted = student, log-probability score = -91.4
  content = do addresses increment by one for example say i have an array 1 2 3 4 and the address of the first element is 100 would the address of the second be 101 and the address of the third be 102 and so on

  correct = student, predicted = student, log-probability score = -120
  content = do we need to check things like a matrix which is initialized and not filled i know that the matrix will have values that were left there in memory and that the values are unpredictable therefore do we need to address this type of case in the function itself with an assert if so how do we check this thanks saul

  correct = student, predicted = student, log-probability score = -134

  content = since the boarders of energy are initialized to max energy the first row index 0 is initialized to max energy then since the cost value of each pixel in first row index 0 of cost matrix is initialized to its energy the value of each pixel in the first row index 0 of cost matrix would be its energy which is max energy since all values in the first row of cost matrix are initialized to max energy all values of the first row of cost matrix are the same then trying to find the column of the smallest value in that row would result in returning the leftmost column index which is 0 that 0 then would go on to be the first element index 0 in seam array is it true that each seam array begins with a 0

  correct = student, predicted = student, log-probability score = -157
  content = since there isnt an example in rme just want to make sure if the array is 12345 when we divide every element by the current maximum value 5 does 1 change to 0 or 1 i dont understand the sentence in the note make sure to do the operations in that order to ensure roundoff error is the same in your implementation as in the correct solution

  content = in the spec it says that the interface allows us to directly copy the matrix struct as follows matrix matnorm mat when i print out the copied matrix it looks fine but after i pass it through matrixnormalize the elements in the matrix appear as follow i am confused about why this happens because the matrixnormalize function was implemented for the staff and works in the public test case and my own test cases with different matrix structs i have tried to debug my code on xcode but xcode always crashes when i try to access data under each colorchannel matrix is there a chance that the matrixnormalize function produces unexpected output under some circumstances

  correct = student, predicted = student, log-probability score = -76.4
  content = when i click into p2cpp it shows that i have an error but autograder still shows queued and doesnt let me submit until current submission is graded

  correct = student, predicted = student, log-probability score = -138
  content = i read 603 about this problem im encountering and dont know what to do my code fails the simple test function when i run make test in putty but outputs the exact same output when i run the autograder it gives me 11 on the simpletest should i leave my code as is or do i need to change something so that it is able to pass the simple test function in putty

  correct = student, predicted = instructor, log-probability score = -174
  content = hi i tried to submit my p2cpp and p2testscpp onto autograder and it says status queued and it has not been graded i have been experiencing this for more than 10 minutes and i cannot submit another submission because there is an error saying you currently have a submission being processed please wait until it is finished before submitting again should i worry about this or what should i do thanks

  correct = student, predicted = student, log-probability score = -218
  content = i all but a few functions finished with function stubs in the unfinished functions i used the command make p2tests to test the functions i have written but when i do this absolutely no terminal output is shown i the iostream library is included in p2testscpp and i am using cout for the results of each test but nothing happens this is what my terminal looks like when i try to run p2tests bash42 make p2tests g wall werror pedantic o2 stdc11 p2testscpp p2cpp recursivelistcpp binarytreecpp recursivecpp testhelperscpp o p2tests bash42 p2tests bash42

  content = i submitted about 8 minutes ago and this is what i get why can i not see my results it also wont let me resubmit because this one is still being graded

  correct = student, predicted = instructor, log-probability score = -124
  content = so i submitted my files to the autograder and it says the following submitted at february 5 2016 at 45500 pm est status queued files submitted p2cpp p2testscpp results does this mean it is still in the process of grading or something else

  correct = student, predicted = student, log-probability score = -70.2
  content = hello the autograder discarded my file and said it is unnecessary while it has exactly the same name as p2cpp does anyone know what is going on here

  correct = student, predicted = student, log-probability score = -75.1

  correct = student, predicted = student, log-probability score = -64.3
  content = do we necessarily have to use static in front of helper function declarations ive been told id get a 0 if i dont put static in front of the helper function declarations

  correct = student, predicted = student, log-probability score = -92.2
  content = im kind of confused for the rmes for the helper functions because arent they basically the body of the actual function and then the actual function is just calling it ultimately i feel like i am rewriting the given rmes thanks

  correct = student, predicted = student, log-probability score = -136
  content = if a function already has a requires statement would its helper function also need a requires statement i take it as if it passes the initial functions requirements then you would not need to restate the requirements for the helper function also many of my effects statements are fairly similar to the original functions rmes is this an issue my helper functions do everything that would be in my original functions but my original functions simply return the helper functions

  correct = student, predicted = student, log-probability score = -56.7
  content = are we allowed to use variables with the static keyword in the fibtail function or does it have to be completed only using helper functions

  correct = student, predicted = student, log-probability score = -172
  content = so i know our test functions should follow the style guidelines comments use assert etc but i was wondering if wed get points taken off if our test function outputs are a bit of a mess for example when an assert doesnt work i would print out the listtree to see whats wrong would we get marked down for having those trees and other comments in the cout output

  correct = student, predicted = student, log-probability score = -59.2
  content = this is what i get when i first type in make p2tests then i copied in the g line but it is unresponsive how do i run p2tests on the terminal

  correct = student, predicted = student, log-probability score = -116
  content = i cannot do make test or compile the code i will post what was outputted to me in the terminal what should i do from here i was in the correct directory all the files are there and none are commented out i believe i types everything in correctly but especially for make test thanks saul

  correct = student, predicted = student, log-probability score = -69.9
  content = is it ok to name helper functions the same name as the actual function for example if i have a tail recoursive function sumdouble would it be ok to name the helper function sumdouble int thank you

  content = can we find people who take are taking eecs281 to write the this review for me

  correct = student, predicted = student, log-probability score = -120
  content = i used the treecontainstest examples as tests on p2tests the first one terminated with an instance of treeexception and that the error there was that it was tree empty shouldnt it return false if the tree is empty instead of error in p2cpp i wrote return false if the tree was empty what do i have to write in p2tests to assert that it returns false and not error

  correct = student, predicted = student, log-probability score = -175
  content = im having a little trouble understanding how to code my base case for maxvalue i have one base case so far and thats when i cannot add any more items to my knapsack due to capacity limits but i want a base base case that returns the highest maxvalue evaluated ever in my function this means that i only want to return the value maxvalue once but how would my code know when to do this how do i know when all combinations have been done

  correct = student, predicted = student, log-probability score = -67.5
  content = will there be any points deducted if i create an array for the function numpartitions cause i saw some answers saying you should not create an array

  content = should we test the case when the identity is not correct for the accumulate function

  correct = student, predicted = student, log-probability score = -79.5
  content = if we use listrest in a function is this considered modifying the list even though it actually creates a new one would we mention this in the m part of our rmes

  correct = student, predicted = student, log-probability score = -116
  content = hi i am testing the traversal function and i tried to use assert to test if the list returned is what it should be however it says that list list is improper use i thought about taking sum of each list and then comparing that but then the order would be lost which is the whole point any suggestions

  correct = student, predicted = student, log-probability score = -0.0306
  content = 

  correct = student, predicted = student, log-probability score = -30.4
  content = is it fine if i submitted to the autograder but i cannot open p2cpp on it

  correct = student, predicted = student, log-probability score = -137
  content = i didnt realize you provided us with a test function for treecontains and although i pass all of my own tests which are more complex than the one provided i dont pass the provided one when run through the treecontainstestcpp file however when i do the same exact tests in my own test suite i pass them should this concern me

  correct = student, predicted = student, log-probability score = -30
  content = do we need to include helper functions in p2h do we make them static in p2h

  correct = student, predicted = student, log-probability score = -135
  content = would a function be considered tree recursive if it had a similar form to this int fooint x int y if x 0 y 0 return 0 if x 0 return fooxy1 if y 0 return foox1y return foox1 y foox y1 so if it usually is tree recursive but there are some cases where it doesnt do a tree recursive call

  correct = student, predicted = student, log-probability score = -159
  content = on the project 2 code review worksheet it says each test case is implemented as a separate function does this mean that every test case for one function must be put in a separate function and called separately in int main ex void testsum1 void testsum2 void testsum3 is it ok to put different test cases for the same function inside of one test function ex void testsum test case 1 test case 2 test case 3

  correct = student, predicted = student, log-probability score = -57.4
  content = if itemvalues is empty how can we initialize such an array is it like itemvalues1 or put zero into the array

  correct = student, predicted = student, log-probability score = -65
  content = im sorry if this has been asked before but for testing do we have to use listequal and treeequal can i just print out the output thanks

  correct = student, predicted = student, log-probability score = -40.6
  content = in the requires part of the rme do the requirements only need to be true for the first call of the function

  correct = student, predicted = student, log-probability score = -40.6
  content = do we need to write unit test for helper functions or the function we wrote as arguments for accumulate function

  correct = student, predicted = student, log-probability score = -229
  content = are we supposed to be able to see the cpp files that we have submitted to the autogravder by clicking on the file i have submitted everything for project 2 and if i click on the p2testscpp after i review my submission it directs me to a page where it shows me exactly what my code looks like but if i click on my p2cpp it just says oops you got an error message object object the same thing happens if i try to click on the nontest files that i submitted from project 1 as well is this an error in loading the page or an error in my code im not really sure how to interpret it thanks

  correct = student, predicted = student, log-probability score = -75.2
  content = if two lists or trees print identically is it safe to assume they are equal or should we use the listequal or treeequal to verify they are equal thanks

  correct = student, predicted = instructor, log-probability score = -123
  content = hey has anyone found a good resource for finding solutions of the partition problem online the highest i found was n6 but i would love to test a higher integer to stress test the program a little more thnaks

  correct = student, predicted = student, log-probability score = -142
  content = for each function i have one test function for it however in each function i may test the function more then once with different numbers i heard through the grape vine i may need to create a whole separate test function for each test of the same function is this true and if its true since i need only one test function for each function could i just get rid of all the other times i test the function in each test function and not loose any points

  correct = student, predicted = student, log-probability score = -79.5
  content = i know we have to write at least one test function for every function but can i call both fib and fibtail under fibtest instead of copy pasting the test function

  correct = student, predicted = student, log-probability score = -130
  content = do we need to write rems for our helper functions and our simple maxint int function i understand in the last project we didnt have to write rems for our functions because they were already in our h file does the same apply here or since we have helper functions we need to do it for those and not the others also do we need to include a prototype of our helper functions in our h that was provided

  correct = student, predicted = student, log-probability score = -53.7
  content = is it required that only one among the two partners submit the project is it okay if both partners submit the projects through the autograder

  correct = student, predicted = student, log-probability score = -210
  content = the p2h file doesnt exactly specify whats supposed to happen when an empty list i assume identity should be returned as accumulate is a generalization of sum and product and if empty lists are passed into those functions they should return their respective identities zero and one im just wondering because for other applications of accumulate perhaps using it to find the max element or the element closest to a certain int value what would the identity be and should the identity be returned

  correct = student, predicted = student, log-probability score = -80
  content = can one person fill out multiple peer reviews if i ask someone to fill it out for me but they have already filled it out for someone else is that allowed

  correct = student, predicted = student, log-probability score = -63.6
  content = for this sheet do we need to turn it in on ctools because its a pdf so im not sure how to edit it or do we print it out and turn it in thanks

  correct = student, predicted = student, log-probability score = -42.5
  content = is calling a tailrecursive function inside a helper function to make a tailrecursive function tailrecursive or not for example if i am calling reverse a tailrecursive function inside a helper function is this still a tailrecursive function

  correct = student, predicted = student, log-probability score = -76.3
  content = for the treecontains function are we supposed to check the condition that the tree given is a sorted binary tree within our function or is it assumed that every tree inputed will be a sorted binary tree

  correct = student, predicted = student, log-probability score = -31.2
  content = can i use reverse in listt first reversefirst is this correct

  correct = student, predicted = student, log-probability score = -52.1
  content = for maxvalue function how are we keep tracking of our values would helper function be useful here

  correct = student, predicted = student, log-probability score = -67.7
  content = 3 should be filtered as an odd number if 3 5 0 9 are put into filterodd then 3 5 and 9 should be in the new list right

  correct = student, predicted = student, log-probability score = -44.6
  content = i did not write that many test functions but am pretty certain my code works do i have to write more

  correct = student, predicted = student, log-probability score = -22.7
  content = are we allowed to write two helper functions for one function

  correct = student, predicted = student, log-probability score = -30

  correct = student, predicted = student, log-probability score = -19.4
  content = are we allowed to use void functions in p2cpp

  correct = student, predicted = student, log-probability score = -21.5
  content = is an empty tree sorted binary tree

  correct = student, predicted = student, log-probability score = -188
  content = i notice that in the tree recursive functions we pass new parameters every time we recur through the function ie switching the tree variable to treeleft or treeright i cant help but notice that maxvale has const arrays and no parameters that would change upon calling it again it just doesnt seem like its meant to be recursive is there something im missing in terms of structure here

  correct = student, predicted = instructor, log-probability score = -120
  content = my partner and i have been working on this for a really long time is there any other hints we can get from other piazza posts it seems that its necessary to have an array is this really necessary we notice a pattern but we cant seem to implement it right any direction would be great

  correct = student, predicted = student, log-probability score = -137
  content = whenever i try to insert an element anywhere other than the first position i get a message saying exception thrown in visual studio and it takes me to a spot in recursivelistcpp i know there must be an error in my code but visual studio wont let me stepinto the function to debug it what should i do

  correct = student, predicted = student, log-probability score = -106
  content = if this function must be treerecursive how are we expected to iterate through these two arrays i get an arri but if i recur through it i wont know my position without a variable to keep track of place

  correct = student, predicted = student, log-probability score = -129
  content = need this because type of grid is int10 which we dont want int gridptr intgrid i was really confused about this step in lab4 and what it meant why is gridptr declared the way it is and why are there parenthesis around int on the right hand side

  correct = student, predicted = student, log-probability score = -172
  content = i am having trouble storing the values from the tree into the list it seems like the values get overwritten when i run my tests the list only contains the top element i run my code on labster and the values are there but they are not saved for the final list that is returned i cannot seem to find a solution that doesnt involve a reference argument does anyone have any tips on how to save the values into one list thanks

  correct = student, predicted = student, log-probability score = -10.7
  content = thank you in advance

  correct = student, predicted = student, log-probability score = -48.5
  content = just to make sure this is an incorrectly sorted binary treethe bottom one right

  correct = student, predicted = student, log-probability score = -137
  content = are we allowed to implement a max helper function that calculates the maximum value of two integers and use it to evaluate the return values of recursive cases when we implemented the function in labster it told us that the function itself is not recursive because the max function is technically not recursive should we implement the max functionality within the recursive case to maintain recursion

  correct = student, predicted = student, log-probability score = -78.8
  content = im trying to test my filter code in labster and its giving me a syntax error when i try to define a variable with a typedef i defined is this not supported in labster

  correct = student, predicted = student, log-probability score = -53.2
  content = since the instructors have already written one test case for maxvalue do we need to write any more test cases for it

  correct = student, predicted = student, log-probability score = -53.1
  content = after i go to httpclass1eecsumichedu it redirects me to httpsclass1eecsumicheducallbackmodeselectnextreason and is just a blank page

  correct = student, predicted = student, log-probability score = -119
  content = so if an element is the last element in a tree and i try to call treeleft or treeright from that would these functions return an empty tree i am slightly confused about these functions because they state that they require the tree not be empty but does that mean they cannot be used on an empty tree or does it mean they cannot create empty subtrees from the last element

  correct = student, predicted = student, log-probability score = -145
  content = when i run make test everything works perfectly i even pass all of the tests however in the provided test for treecontains it appears to be testing if my program can identify if a particular sub tree is contained within the whole tree this just seems odd because treecontains is only supposed to see if a tree contains a particular element

  correct = student, predicted = student, log-probability score = -107
  content = the wikipedia page for partition has a recursive mathematical formula that solves the partition problem for any number n are we allowed to use this formula or do you have to come up with our own unique recursive function

  correct = student, predicted = student, log-probability score = -56.6
  content = the title pretty much says it all in the spec it says we cannot use pass by reference for the main functions but can we for our helper functions

  correct = student, predicted = student, log-probability score = -115
  content = lets say i have a helper function for fx called fhelperx in another function gx is it considered bad style if i call fhelper or i have to recreate a ghelper which is the exact same thing as fhelper

  correct = student, predicted = student, log-probability score = -94.5
  content = traversal is not tail recursive the problem is it calls other functions highlighted that arent tail recursive to be clear this means that traversal is recursive but not tail recursive correct if it were not recursive it would have that statement that says traversal does not appear to use any recursion at all

  content = are we responsible for handling a wrong identity in accumulate in addition 0 is the identity because x 0 x assume i have lista 1234 if i call accumulate using an incorrect identity accumulate lista add 1 will it be a problem if it returns 11 instead of 10 thanks

  correct = student, predicted = student, log-probability score = -98.5
  content = i was wondering where we are supposed to put the implementations of the helper functions for project 2 are we supposed to implement them right above each function that they are for or can we declare them at the beginning of the code and implement them all at the end which is considered better style

  correct = student, predicted = student, log-probability score = -159
  content = an attribute of a wellformed sorted tree is that all elements in the right subtree are greater than or equal to the top element of the tree and all elements in the left subtree are strictly less than the top element of the tree when it refers to the top element does it mean the very peak or just the element above the branch 4 can 3 be a four 2 6 1 3 5 7

  correct = student, predicted = student, log-probability score = -135
  content = do we need to write fib regular nontail recursively to be more specific i wrote fib regular tail recursively not realizing there was a function specifically to write it tail recursively i noticed however in the rme it states this must be recursive but need not be tail recursive does this mean i can just have both regular and fibtail be the same exact thing

  correct = student, predicted = student, log-probability score = -269
  content = i understand that the identity for addition is 0 and for multiplication is 1 but i dont necessarily understand how that is specifically used in accumulate i had written sum and product before accumulate so i had already taken care of their identities so i know that accumulate must work for any associative fn that takes two ints but im also confused of the usage of the parameter int fnint int the example given was just add that refers to the name of a given function correct rme states that for the example the following invocation returns the sum of all elements but what was the difference between calling accumulate vs add basically my question is what is accumulate doing that product or sum isnt

  correct = student, predicted = student, log-probability score = -218
  content = before i noticed it was predeclared for us i wrote my own equivalent to the filterlistt list bool fnint which is actually more efficient as it does not require the creation of yet another helper function filter is already called from filterodd and filtereven my function takes the form of filterbool fnint listt list listt sofar and is tail recursive without the need of a helper function may i use this in lieu of the given starterfunction

  correct = student, predicted = student, log-probability score = -66.7

  correct = student, predicted = student, log-probability score = -45.7
  content = is it okay that nearly all of our functions require helper functions in order to be tail recursive

  correct = student, predicted = student, log-probability score = -213
  content = i ran the simpletest and all the numbers came out correct diff and sdiff claim that the output doesnt match the correct output file even though they look identical so i thought it was a common spacing bug if i use a w flag in diff the problem is resolved so it must be a whitespace problem i assume however diffcheckercom says our output file and the correct output file are identical should i ignore this as we did not write the simple test output and because our numerical output is correct

  correct = student, predicted = student, log-probability score = -50.4
  content = eg in c when i do cout 17 5 it prints 2 if i remember correctly isnt 17 5 3

  correct = student, predicted = student, log-probability score = -128
  content = hypothetically if there were only one element in the argument listt list for the accumulate function what would be returned i understand the base case when the list is empty returns identity but if a one element list was passed in the function pointer fn which requires two parameters in order to be executed will not be satisfied

  content = i am not quite sure how the fib functions are supposed to work do i create a tree of ns then add them on the way up if so can i use a helper function to first create the tree then another function to get the fibonacci number i guess i am confused how to recursively call the fib function that only passes in an int not a tree

  correct = student, predicted = student, log-probability score = -59.7
  content = in the rme for numpartitions is says that it must be tree recursive is this supposed to be tail recursive or is there a specific type of tree recursion

  correct = student, predicted = student, log-probability score = -81.7

  correct = student, predicted = student, log-probability score = -16.5
  content = can we have a helper function call another helper function

  correct = student, predicted = student, log-probability score = -46.5

  correct = student, predicted = student, log-probability score = -345
  content = so i have written code for traversal and it appears to move through trees in the correct order but i am having trouble getting it into a list when i replace the line of my code that calls listmake by doing list listmaketreeelttreelist with a cout statement that just prints the top element of the tree to the console it prints the elements of the tree in the correct order from left to right however when trying to put these elements into a list i get very weird results as intermediate lists and ultimately end up with an empty list i tried printing the list at every stage and the results dont make a lot of sense i should be outputting something like 7 3 4 2 1 9 but the i am getting something like 7 3 2 4 1 4 9 1 4 when i print the list after every modification of it i am wondering if this is something wrong with the way i am using the listmake function my code clearly is traversing the tree correctly but the list aspect is not working

  correct = student, predicted = student, log-probability score = -89.6

  correct = student, predicted = student, log-probability score = -299
  content = i keep getting new stack frames each time it goes through any of my tail recursive functions here are the stack frames for my accumulate function i believe the function is tail recursive i rewrote it all in labster and tested it in there and it does say its tailrecursive and running through the simulation does not produce any new stack frames but on visual studio it still creates all these stack frames for all of the functions there is also something weird going on after my base case becomes true and it attempts to return the accumulated value the debugger keeps jumping between a bracket and the recursive return statement of my functions this occurs until the value of the accumulate variable is back to its original value but then my function returns the correct value of the accumulated variable before it was reduced and it passes all my tests what is going on here

  correct = student, predicted = student, log-probability score = -256
  content = i have been trying to debug my code in labster but i keep experiencing a syntax error which labster refuses to ignore so that i cannot actually simulate any program on labster the syntax error is not in my code but rather the copy and pasted class definition of recursivelist specfically at the following line it throws an error at column 31 which is the beginning of the parameter elt explicit recursivelistint elt since my functions require this class definition to define all of the other functions that were given to us i think i do not know how to proceed does anyone have any advice for how to fix this in labster thanks

  correct = student, predicted = student, log-probability score = -105
  content = is it possible to append an empty list to another list consisting of an integer followed by a wellformed list for example if lista is empty and listb is 2 4 6 can we append lista to listb would our resulting list be 2 4 6 or would we not get a wellformed list because a is empty

  content = i wrote the first function listcontains and wanted to try to run and compile it in visual studio but i get these errors and im not sure what it means i have include iostream and include p2h in my p2cpp file and in my source files i have p2h p2cpp recursiveh binarytreeh and recursionlisth

  correct = student, predicted = student, log-probability score = -77.7
  content = the functions listcontains sum and product do not have a requires clause so is it safe to assume the list could have anything as in be empty or one element or multiple

  correct = student, predicted = student, log-probability score = -104
  content = if we want to use a text editor instead of nano in the command line while sshing to caen is it possible to use sublime to edit the documents remotely how would you go about doing that

  content = hi so i am having difficulty with the basic issue of compiling through terminal before my program is finished it keeps saying that there is an undefined reference to main in the function start both of which i have not written then it lists a whole bunch of undefined reference to each of my functions in p2cpp i do not know to what this is referring this is how i am compiling g p2cpp recursivecpp o p2 thanks

  correct = student, predicted = student, log-probability score = -48.5
  content = is it possiible to do lista listb given both are of data type listt

  correct = student, predicted = student, log-probability score = -16.5
  content = what if the lest is empty

  correct = student, predicted = student, log-probability score = -57.9

  correct = student, predicted = student, log-probability score = -199
  content = i am working on developing one of the list functions but i have run into an issue whenever i return a list from one function it seems to disappear as in the list that is assigned the output of that function is empty i have checked and verified that the function inside the function is correct and certainly has values so i am unsure why it is not being properly assigned in case this comes up yes i checked the contents of the list by making a copy first so i didnt undo the entire list in the process of checking it

  correct = student, predicted = student, log-probability score = -28.8
  content = if a function calls another function that is recursive but not tail recursive is it still recursive

  correct = student, predicted = student, log-probability score = -131
  content = does the operation listfirst return the first element as in the first element to be accessed meaning the one that was last deposited to the list or does it mean the first item that was created in the list to be more clear if i create a list like this empty 1 21 321 does listfirst return 1 because its the first item or does it return 3 because it is the first accessible item in the list

  correct = student, predicted = student, log-probability score = -64.3
  content = will we be deducted points for having bad style on labs or is the grade purely based on completion

  correct = student, predicted = student, log-probability score = -114
  content = im confused about using helper functions when using them with tail recursion does it matter where the base cases are defined also when youre using a helper function will that always be what you return in your other function because the helper function is also tail recursive so the original function remains tail recursive as well

  correct = student, predicted = student, log-probability score = -38.4
  content = should our helper functions be in p2cpp or should we make a helpercpp and include that file

  correct = student, predicted = student, log-probability score = -114
  content = i was working on my countdigitcpp file and i was trying to undo a few things but i undid too many things and now everything in the countdigitcpp file is gone i tried to restore to the file that was given at the beginning but that did not work what should i do do

  content = instead of using a helper function can you give an initial value to a parameter for example could i do something like this int sumlistt list int sofar 0 code here return sumlist sofar

  correct = student, predicted = student, log-probability score = -112
  content = i have just started the project i downloaded all the files and implement the sum function however when i try to do the make p2test in terminal it gives the following error i am missing something to include in the files or should i not be doing this test yet i just want to run the p2testscpp file thanks

  correct = student, predicted = student, log-probability score = -42.9
  content = if we try to access an element outside of a list would it return an error or give back 0

  correct = student, predicted = student, log-probability score = -137
  content = im confused as to how to go about the iterations for this i implemented a while loop with if statements but it turns out my function is tail recursive im not sure how to do this without it being tail recursive if i used for loops im just confused about the i part since n is a variable and not a vectorarray how would i also know my size range of the for loop would it just be that n 1

  correct = student, predicted = student, log-probability score = -60.8
  content = im trying to create test cases for functions and was not sure if lists could contain negative numbers or not could somebody clarify this for me

  content = hey was just wondering if any one had suggestions for easy ways to share code between partners for the projects like is there a google docs for code thx in advance

  correct = student, predicted = instructor, log-probability score = -88.4
  content = are we allowed to use github to help us collaborate during partner projects or is that not allowed because its publicly accessible and could violate the honor code

  correct = student, predicted = student, log-probability score = -205
  content = i read in the specification that we are allowed to use helper functions for our tail recursive functions but it only mentioned using them for the fibonacci functions specifically are we also allowed to use them for the other functions such as reverse product filterodd etc also it says that we have to declare them as static is this as easy as just writing static in front of it or do we have to do something else when i just write static i get this error p2h8215 error ‘ listt filterevenhelperlistt listt ’ declared ‘ static ’ but never defined werrorunusedfunction

  correct = student, predicted = student, log-probability score = -81.9
  content = i tried returning a variable and it didnt work it just returned whatever the variable was and ignored the i simply just said variable on the line before that and then returned it and it worked fine just a heads up

  correct = student, predicted = student, log-probability score = -39.4
  content = for example i want to add int times0 before a function to count digits

  correct = student, predicted = student, log-probability score = -108
  content = i am wondering if we need to add comments to our lab homework also i noticed that if i copy hailstonecpp from labster the file dont contain code like includeiostream using namespace std should we add these too

  correct = student, predicted = student, log-probability score = -65.7
  content = im slightly confused about what to include in p2cpp do we just include iostream and p2h or all the other header functions in the starter files too

  correct = student, predicted = instructor, log-probability score = -94

  correct = student, predicted = student, log-probability score = -119
  content = i am confused about the function maxvalue int maxvalue const int itemvalues const int itemweights int numitems int capacity according to the description what is the variable numitems if i set numitems 5 but i have 7 items in itemvalues and itemweights does that mean i can only choose 5 items out of 7

  correct = student, predicted = student, log-probability score = -260
  content = i just started this project and am trying to run the makefile command for simpletestcpp to start this project with a better understanding of how all the files work together however when i do this i get a long line of errors that boil down to g being unable to find references to listmake and listmakeint recursivelist const i dont understand how i could have done something wrong as the list of links that would allow simpletestcpp to access those functions lie outside what i have already touched p2h recursiveh recursivelisth does anyone understand how i messed up

  correct = student, predicted = student, log-probability score = -102
  content = since we havent gone over function pointers could you post an example of a simple test function for accumulate or at least a fillintheblanks carcass of a test function so that we know where to plug in our test cases

  correct = student, predicted = student, log-probability score = -224
  content = im having some difficulty writing the recursive function for countdigitscpp countdigitsrecursive i have made the function recursive but not tail recursive however i am running into trouble with keeping track of how many times the digit appears in the given number i have a variable count declared in order to keep track however i cant find a way to initialize it without messing up the function if i initialize it to zero at the start of the function then every time i call countdigitsrecursive when executing the recursive case the count variable will be reset to zero making it impossible to keep track this way any thoughts

  correct = student, predicted = student, log-probability score = -85.3
  content = after reading the project 2 spec i am still confused as to what it means by identity the identity argument is typically the value for which fnx identity x and fnidentity x x for any x thanks

  correct = student, predicted = student, log-probability score = -189
  content = in lecture 4 we wrote normal recursive and tail recursive listmax functions both of the solutions involved using a max helper function see below which i found confusing because it used notations that i had never seen before static int maxint x int y return x y x y what does it mean to have a static int as the return type also what do the question mark and colon mean

  correct = student, predicted = student, log-probability score = -116
  content = for the counting function in lab 2 could someone please explain the difference between recursion and tail recursion im a little lost i kind of thought of them as being the same thing and im not sure how to distinguish between the two since we have to write one function with recursion and another with tail recursion

  correct = student, predicted = student, log-probability score = -184
  content = im using pass by reference to increment the value of a counter each time the specified digits appeared in the number n when i tried running this through a compiler visual studio it seems to work perfectly fine however when i test it using labster the first test seems to always return a 0 for the function is there a way to overcome this problem or a better alternative method what could i be doing wrong thanks

  correct = student, predicted = student, log-probability score = -70

  content = do we need ensure that there are no spaces or commas after the last number in our hailstone sequences

  correct = student, predicted = student, log-probability score = -97.6
  content = should i just copy the code from labster into a text file or do i have to add namespaces and run the code on my ide also should both hailstonecpp and countdigitscpp be in one file or two separate files

  correct = student, predicted = student, log-probability score = -66.7
  content = can i submit my code from labster for lab 2 as text files without including any textiles or using any namespaces

  correct = student, predicted = student, log-probability score = -55.6
  content = the solution for listmax using tail recursion uses 2 helper functions can it be done with just 1 helper function

  correct = student, predicted = student, log-probability score = -105
  content = so i am using a counter to record the amount of times the digit occurs i initialized my variable as int counter 0 but when i use recursion it keeps resetting my counter to 0 and not saving the value how do i save the value of my counter

  correct = student, predicted = student, log-probability score = -138
  content = when i try to implement and iteration in countdigititerative i have a condition in the code that states n n 10 so i can use only the last digit of the number for comparison when i run my code the answer always ends up being n 0 instead of the same number with one less element how can i correctly implement that operation

  correct = student, predicted = student, log-probability score = -133
  content = in the lab one of the tests of digit counting was measuring the amount of times 0 appears in 0 but 0 appears an infinite amount of times in any number so for the test where n 0 and digit 0 do we count this as 0 1 infinite i can understand counting 0 finitely if we were using a string but were not were counting it as an int what value should my functions return for this case

  correct = student, predicted = student, log-probability score = -117

  correct = student, predicted = student, log-probability score = -120
  content = if the way we prefer to format things like functions is different than that in the given code should we change the given codes style to make it all consistent or should it be left the way it was given i am specifically referring to statstestscpp for example if i prefer to format a function like int main code other code return 0 but the given code is in this style int main code other code return 0

  correct = student, predicted = student, log-probability score = -146
  content = when i implement the mode and summarize functions i see myself comparing two values to see if they are equal since were comparing doubles and rounding errors could affect output of the operator should we check to see if the difference is within a small range instead or are the values precise enough that the operator will be sufficient

  content = i am confused between the project 1 specs and the percentiles rme in statsh from what i gathered in the rme we are supposed to use the microsoft excel version to calculate which make sense however in the project 1 specs in the section where it shows how to read in data from the romance page all of the percentiles are 0 and 1 or 1 and 2 to my understanding the true percentiles in these cases should be decimals between the two numbers for example the 25th percentile of the data ranging from 01 should be somewhere around 25 depending on the actual data but the answer shows the 25th percentile being 0 the test data provided is unclear because the 5 data points perfectly correspond with the true percentile markers so for the percentiles are we supposed to round down to the closest actual value from the data or are we supposed to stay true to the excel definition of percentiles thanks
