exam,please do not discuss the exam until 400 today thank you
exam,how is this 3 3 why is it not 2 1
calculator,is there anyway we can see the tests that the autograder ran on our old projects
exam,instead of using first could i instead write first null on the exam
exam,for example in w15 problem 4d when we create base baseptr der does this make an instance of base with value 5
exam,im very confused by this question solution it was my understanding that we were to take the current list of a collector and modify the list so that there were no duplicates but the solution shows us making a whole new instance of a collector c and using a list from a different collector im just really confused could someone please clarify the solution
exam,in the context of the problem below why do we have to go with option 1 to deallocate the array vs option 2 when would we want to use option 2 option 1 for int i 0 i numparts i delete partsi option 2 delete parts
exam,if simpleplayer is a derived type of base class player and i have code player p new simpleplayer is a player object allocated space in the heap just like a simpleplayer object is also how are both the objects destroyed when we say delete p
exam,i dont see how the solution here would evaluate an item in the list that is equal to the item we are comparing the comparator provided only evaluates true is the item is greater than the compared value not grater than or equal to so in the example provided this solution would not return 4 because 4 is not greater than 4 so it would return 5 am i missing something
exam,june 20th was yesterday is the exam review today 21st or tomorrow 22nd
exam,i have a few questions about problem 5 1 for part a why is number exception caught printed is it because rangeex is derived from numex class and so the numex catch block catches any child class exceptions 2 for part b does the code terminate because there is no catch block for inputex if so can a also be a correct catch block and location for part c if not why would c be the correct choice thanks problem 5 solutions eecs280w15finalsolutionsannotated2pdf
recursion,what does numitems indicate are we supposed to interpret that if for example numitems 8 we should be going through items 0 7 in our arrays
recursion,on the autograder there are a bunch of boundary tests could someone quickly clarify that
recursion,could someone explain to me what the identity parameter does in correspondence with fn i dont completely understand the specs
recursion,i may have missed this somewhere in the specs but would we expect to have negative numbers in our liststrees
recursion,should we include rmes for every one of our helper functions in p2cpp and for any function pointers we made to test filteraccumulate in p2testscpp
exam,will the final review on 621 be recorded i have a conflict but would still like to see the material reviewed
recursion,for my maxvalue test cases some runs it turns out correct while other runs it doesnt i print out the result every time i run it and i found out that sometimes it doesnt cover the last element in the item list while other times it does any ideas as to why this would be the case it seems to only be a problem for the last item in the item list
recursion,i test my maxvalue function on labster and it worked well but the autograder told me it exceeded the time limit anyone know how to fix it
recursion,the rme for this function does not mention what to do if both lists first and second are empty lists should it just return an empty list or a list of two empty lists or would this be the same thing
recursion,can we write a tree recursive helper function for numpartitions that essentially takes in the same input as numpartitions but also an additional input variable for keeping track of the largest integer so far basically can we use helper functions that have recursion in them even if the function is not tail recursive for example int recursionint n return recursionhelpern n static int recursionhelperint n int high do tree recursion and return int would something like this be ok for the numpartitions function
recursion,can we write a helper function to calculate the max between two integers and use that in our recursion
recursion,on labster its saying that my treecontains function isnt tail recursive because it calls the traversal function but then my helper function which gets called by treecontains is tail recursive does this mean my treecontains function is tail recursive or not
recursion,do we have to consider functions for accumulate for which order of operations matters ie if textttfn pointed to an textttint divide function i seem to have trouble getting the same output for the nontail recursive implementation given in the spec and my tailrecursive version for these types of functions since they seem to start at opposite ends of the list
recursion,if we are not allowed to modify the values array its const nor are we allowed to create new arrays how else are we supposed to keep track of which items that have already been included such that we do not include them again in the knapsack thanks
exam,when is the alternative final exam
recursion,can anyone explain what the accumulate function is supposed to do i dont really understand what is meant by return the tail recursive equivalent of fnlistfirstlist accumulatelistrestlist fn identity is there a parenthesis missing thanks
recursion,it says in the project spec that we cant use anything other than tail recursion to implement the functions in p2h but will there be a problem with the autograder if we use iterative helper functions to test our code what about including libraries such as vector also in p2testcpp
calculator,anyone want to do the code review after lecture tomorrow
recursion,are we calling our project five file p2cpp or p5cpp i realize its is a typo but i dont know if the name of your h file has to match the name of our cpp file
recursion,do tree functions in p5 also have to be tail recursive or just general recursive
exam,on the final will we be allowed to have one sheet with notes like we had for the midterm
calculator,when i run this in xcode i get the correct output however this is what i get in terminal any help would be great
calculator,when i run calc01 test on my computer and sdiff it there is no difference with the correct output but the autograder said i did not pass the test what might be the problem and i pass the test of calc00 on autograder
calculator,when i manually input the arguments into the terminal my calccpp seems to work correctly and print the right things to the terminal but when i use io redirection with calc calctest00in calctest00out nothing appears in the calctest00out file i cant figure out why nothing is being printed in the calctest00out file
calculator,im passing the stack public test in xcode as well as the other visibly graded autograder tests but i dont pass on caen running with valgrind produces this output i have been trying to change things and look into why this is happening for the past two days but havent been able to figure it out if anyone has advice of what to look for when trying to fix this i would really appreciate it it seems as though im trying to access an invalid next node but i dont understand why the problem wouldnt appear in xcode
calculator,should we have a node destructor my popfront and popback arent deleting the nodes that are being pointed at
calculator,it says the output is different for lines 2 5 i am printing a space after each element in the stack as well as a newline at the end of the stack is there any better way to get more information about whats going wrong
calculator,hi all im getting segmentation faults that im pretty sure are related to how i wrote popback and popfront but i dont really know how to fix them since i call popfront in popall and popall in my deconstructor these are really the only functions managing dynamic memory for me at first i wrote them to 1 assert that list is not empty 2 make a temp pointer to firstlast so as not to orphan it 3 set the secondpenultimate item to firstlast 4 delete the item that we wanted to remove through the temp pointer at this point even though they looked nearly identical to me popback was not doing its job but popfront was but if i tried to run lots of test cases i would eventually get a seg fault i went back and tried to fix it by setting firstprev lastnext to 0 a null pointer but now nothing works my program immediately seg faults any help is much appreciated
calculator,i cant find any description in the spec about whether should be readonly or also allow user to change datum thanks
calculator,how am i supposed to be checking whether my calccpp runs properly as of right now i am checking to see if my calccpp compiles correctly and then i run calc calctest00in calctest00out i then use sdiff to check between the given correct output and what should be in the output of calctestout the problem i am running into is that my out file does not have anything in it but when i manually enter in the numbers i end up with the correct result i think there may be a problem with my printing functions in stackh but i would first like to be sure that i am testing calccpp properly on the caen environment
calculator,i dont think this is relevant to the project but i noticed something peculiar while debugging stackh that i couldnt find an explanation for the following code stackint stack stackint fill with 1bottom 2 3top cout stackpop cout stackpop cout stackpop endl prints out 3 2 1 which is the stack from top to bottom as one might expect however this code cout stackpop stackpop stackpop endl prints out 1 2 3 instead i wouldve thought these would be equivalent expressions but evidently not it doesnt seem to affect the rest of my program all my test cases run fine and my driver works i just thought it was a really weird phenomenon and was wondering if anyone could shed some light on it
calculator,whenever i try to run it i get stuck here anyone have any ideas
calculator,im confused what decoration i should put in front when i declare a operator function for dr also since number and operator all are typed in as string in command line how could we distinguish them
calculator,are we allowed to add other private data members in listh
calculator,should it prints out infinity or negative infinity when denominator is 0
calculator,is the purpose of this function to overwrite the datum of the previous node or insert a new node with the given datum
calculator,we are passing all the public tests but we are having a small memory leak somewhere in stackh it is stating that we are creating a longs that were never destroyed but we never created any long variables does anyone have an idea of whats going on
calculator,how do i test my code on caen i want to make sure my code has no memory leaks what should i enter in the terminal
calculator,is there any way to test iterators default constructor i want to check that nodeptr points to 0 but cant access nodeptr in the test files
calculator,could someone tell me whats wrong
calculator,we have 0 definitely lost 0 indirectly lost 0 possibly lost but we have 120 bytes lost in 5 blocks in still reachable are we actually leaking memory
calculator,should helper functions be the first things declared and only implemented after main or is it okay to implement when declared before main
calculator,is there a difference between setting first to 0 vs setting it to nullptr
calculator,so our calccpp works pretty well but listcompilecheck is failing stating that b iter3 mylistend has invalid operators to a binary expression const listintiterator and listintiterator why is a comparison between const and noncost invalid
calculator,as far as i can tell its not possible to instantiate useful iterators outside list without list having begin and end functions however begin and end arent included in the project spec and were not allowed to modify the lists public interface only add private helper functions are we allowed to add public begin and end functions or is there another way of creating iterators outside of list that can access whats contained in a list
calculator,what should we expect to see as output if we have say 10 1 10 10 or 00 00 there is no specifications for special cases such as these just a few other weird ones bulletpointed on page 7 of the spec
calculator,i have my and overloads in the public section of iterator but they wouldnt compile according to the internet its necessary to prefix both functions with friend why is this necessary and what does friendship mean in this context
calculator,for the copy all function in list i am under the assumption you cant access the first pointer to the first node in other since there is no public function that allows you to access the first node besides its data how would you copy the next nodes data if you cant access others first nodes next pointer
calculator,does this function erase the contents of this and then copy over the nodes from other or does it add the nodes from other to the end of this
calculator,does the iterator assignment operator need to delete the old node and create a new node equal to–but not the reference of–the other iterators node or does it only need to set the datum value equal to the other nodes datum value
calculator,when i stepping through my function to test the insert function my functions work and insert at the correct spots but when i turn off the breakpoints and run the entire test from start to finish it doesnt insert correctly anyone know why this happens i am using xcode
calculator,is there a difference between a valid and dereferenceable iterator for example in listtinsert could it be possible that an iterator hold a null node pointer and be expected to create a node at the back of the list im not sure how else a node could be inserted at the back of a list through listtinsert since there are no elements after the back for the iterator to point to be dereferenceable thanks
calculator,in the stackh file the compiler is getting angry when i try to declare an iterator based on a list of t is that not allowed in general or could i be making a mistake somewhere else in my code
euchre,im on central right now in the ugli i can meet up pretty much wherever
calculator,i noticed when i tried testing very large numbers that our rationalh was declared with int instead of long this is a bit limiting for our calculator isnt it
calculator,after the erase function is called should the iterator be at the node before or after the erased node or does it not matter
calculator,when implementing rationalcpp i came into such a problem that could we put 0 as a denominator in rational especially in the constructor part since c will automatically change 0 to 0 1 0 actually means 1 0 in c and this is not we want is there anybody can help me with this thanks
euchre,if anyone is still looking for a partner and can meet tomorrow beforeafter lecture let me know
calculator,if you get valgrind errors are pretty confident you have no memory issues in your code and have a leak summary similar to below saying you have possibly lost 2064 bytes in 1 block then it is likely an issue with mac osx el capitan and is not your fault see here httpstackoverflowcomquestions34573039possiblememoryleakvalgrindinosxelcapitan run your program as well as valgrind on caen and those errors should no longer be there
calculator,the google form for project 4 says that the registration is for project 3 is the link really for project 4
euchre,i am looking for a partner to review my code let me know if you are interested
calculator,im getting an error that says lexical or preprocessor issue stackh file not found it says the same thing for list h as well
calculator,trying to clear up is operator for iterator supposed to be prefix im unsure based on the wording in the comments and the spec thanks
euchre,when i run the pack public test on my computer it runs fine but for some reason when i run it in caen it spits back a segmentation fault when it tries to initialize a new pack why could this be
euchre,hi im trying to test player and i want to test by looking at the size of a players hand or particular cards within a players hand im trying to write const helper functions that return those values but if we cannot modify the playerh files how are we supposed to let our test file access those functions thanks
euchre,delete works for alice and human but not bob
euchre,i am still confused with the shuffle option is it the case that we always shuffle between hands otherwise we are actually playing with the same hand of cards all the time and if the noshuffle is chosen then only the first shuffle will be turned off
euchre,ive been using sdiff to compare my euchre results to euchretest00 01 and 50 in terminal and none of them return any errors but only 01 is passing the autograder
euchre,in this section of the autograder all our test cases show up except our pack test cases is this intentional there is no student test suite student pack tests
euchre,my euchre driver is getting a segmentation fault whenever i have to shuffle the deck however my shuffle function did not cause segmentation faults during testing what is going on
euchre,the instructions for the simple player states that if the player can follow suit they play the highest card that follows suit otherwise they play the lowest card in their hand however in euchretest01outcorrect drew plays his jack of hearts even though the lead card is the jack of diamonds and he has two other diamond cards in his hand
euchre,say for example the trump suit is hearts and the left bower is a jack of diamonds if we perform the suitnext function on the left bower should it return hearts or diamonds i have it returning diamonds because the left bower is technically considered as a trump suit but i just wanted to make sure that this was correct because the autograder says i have a buggy test and i think this is one of the things that might be causing it
euchre,in the spec it says for consistency with the autograder to print the human players hand in ascending order as defined by the operator when prompting them to make trump so i tried to use the sort function to get the hand in order before printing it but found that we cant call sort inside a const function im confused as to why we would be asked to print the human players in ascending order but not be allowed to use the sort function to do so inside the maketrump function is there a different way were supposed to sort the hand or are we just supposed to leave it unsorted in this function
euchre,in hand 1 of test 01 bob is the dealer and cathy orders up clubs when the upcard is a jack of spades according to the correct solution bob discards the jack of spades however surely he shouldnt do that because the jack of spades is left bower and he has several lower cards heres bobs hand before the discard nine of spades ace of diamonds ten of spades jack of clubs queen of clubs
euchre,when you get to the third trick in hand 0 the correct output says alice leads with jack of diamonds but from my understanding when a simple player leads if they have only trump cards in their hand which alice does then they are supposed to play the highest trump card in their hand which in this case would be the ace of spades all my output is correct except for hand 0 tricks 3 and 4 i am getting the ace leads in trick 3 and the jack leads trick 4 does anyone know why this may be happening and why the jack is played before the ace
euchre,playerteststartercpptext0x457 undefined reference to cardcardstdstring const stdstring const playerteststartercpptext0x4eb undefined reference to cardcardstdstring const stdstring const tmpccrveartoplayerteststartercpptext0x57f more undefined references to cardcardstdstring const stdstring const follow tmpccrvearto in function testmaketrumpround1 playerteststartercpptext0x12e6 undefined reference to playerfactorystdstring const stdstring const playerteststartercpptext0x158a undefined reference to playerfactorystdstring const stdstring const my playerteststartercpp works well in xcode but when i tried it in caen it just gave me the warning like this what could be the problems i did include the player h and cardh not include the packh
euchre,ive been trying for the last few hours to figure out a correct way to output the sorted hand for human play specifically maketrump is there any obvious way to duplicate the vector sort and output it ive tried passing it by value to a sortprint function that still violates the constraints any tips would be highly appreciated
euchre,when i submit my files to the autograder i get a message saying playertest1cpp320 fatal error packcpp no such file or directory include packcpp compilation terminated i am initializing some of my players hands by making a deck and getting cards from that deck directly since im doing that i have to use the header file for packh when i run my tests on linux everything seems to pass fine by not in the autograder running linux by connecting via ssh on mac terminal
euchre,playerteststartercpp in function void testmaketrumpround1 playerteststartercpp635 error player was not declared in this scope player simpleplayer1 playerfactorysimple1 simple when i tried to test my test cases in autograder it kept giving me this kind of message and i was wondering what it means by palyer was not declared in this scople can we create a player in playertestcpp functions or we have to do other ways
euchre,if lead and trump are spades and hearts respectively if you have nine of diamonds and ace of clubs in a players hand would nine of diamonds be less than ace of clubs or would ace of clubs because of the hierarchy in cardh
euchre,can anyone give a hint about testing the add and discard function in playercpp
euchre,when trying to implement the playerfactory i keep running into this error in the line return new simple
euchre,for the human playerwe need to work with inputoutput streams eg to print the players hand and receive a decision in maketrump if i write maketrump to have two extra parameters input and output streams i get a complaint that the function shouldnt have more than four parameters if i write an extra function in my human class to deal with inputoutput i get a complaint that my function doesnt exist how am i meant to deal with input and output for human players
euchre,we have a playertesthumancpp file for specifically testing the human subclass of player however input is required specified in the standard output to run these tests were getting a giant boldfaced surrounded in message from the autograder saying that this file is marking the correct solution as buggy should we be concerned about this is there anything we can do since by the interface requirements player subclass functions cant take a speacific stream ie stringstream as an argument for testing
euchre,how to fix the error like this
euchre,i created a new input file packtestin to test the nondefault constructor in packcpp however the autograder discards this as unnecessary when i upload my test cases is this something i should be concerned aboutcan fix
euchre,currently i have the dealone function using an if else statement to check if the pack is empty or not in the case that the pack is empty what should the function do should it exitexitfailure it says it must return a card so im not sure if we need to check for this scenario or not
euchre,i dont think i understand the point of having a game struct where should i put it so that its variables are visible to my entire program and its helper functions why not just store those variables directly in main and pass them into my functions by reference right now i only have four variables in my game struct
euchre,i passed all three test i wrote on caen terminal but got this warning from autograder what is the problem here
euchre,in the provided euchretest00outcorrect file for the third trick it has drew playing a queen of clubs i am confused because at this time she also has a nine and ten of hearts in her hand since she cant follow suit diamonds wouldnt she play her lowest card the 9 of hearts
euchre,hi there im wondering about how our output will be graded on the autograder specifically the gameplay output such as human player name and name passes etc etc are these graded on a functionbyfunction basis meaning that our functions will be graded one by one and be matched with a correct autograder output or do we just need to have the correct overall output it was never really specified in the specs which outputs go where so my partner and i used our better judgement
euchre,i am running valgrind on my code and i have 0 bytes directly lost all my memory leaks are in possibly lost when i googled what possibly lost meant i found out that possibly lost means your program is leaking memory unless youre doing unusual things with pointers that could cause them to point into the middle of an allocated block see the user manual for some possible causes use showpossiblylostno if you dont want to see these reports i dont know what this means could anyone clarify also any reason i could be getting possibly lost memory
euchre,i tried to test these conditions in euchrecpp but i ended up with this warning in xcode do anyone have any ideas how to fix this warning
euchre,hi im having trouble calling the addanddiscard function in maketrump i think its because maketrump is a const function while addanddiscard is not if this is the case how are we supposed to pick up the upcard and discard the lowest in maketrump without calling addanddiscard
euchre,whenever there is someone ordering up we should print the dealers hand how do we know who the dealer is when we are in a random player class so for this function does the code like ifisdealer orderingup print the hand work
euchre,what it says in the title whenever i make tests the sdiff fails due to euchre insert command line arguments here not being in the output file is there a particular reason for this problem i am on os x does make tests only work properly on caen environments
euchre,specifically for the player class in project 3 im wondering if we are allowed to make private member functions as helper functions for example i think it would be easier to implement something like a function that returns the highest card in a players hand if it didnt have to be written outside the class i dont know if this breaks the rules of interfaceimplementationrepresentation stuff or would be considered poor style
euchre,i get the code like if something something when the condition is too long for one line from which point should i divide the condition into the second line
euchre,the maketrump rme said return true and change orderupsuit to desired suit does that mean that i need to assign the orderupsuit after i return true
euchre,in the maketrump function what should i put in the if statement condition whenever there is an order up situation should i define a bool called orderupi dont think that works
euchre,when i try to delete my player objects it gives me the error cannot delete expression of valuetype aka player
euchre,im confused as to why the humanplayer functions leadcard playcard take in ledcard and trump given that the human determines their own strategy is it just because the functions in simple player need these parameters and the two functions have to have the same signatures so basically are we supposed to do anything with these parameters or are we just prompting the user for the card of their choice
euchre,im getting a swap error in playercpp and it wont compile does anyone know what the issue could be thanks
euchre,would we need to implement screwing the dealer for the human player whos the dealer during round two it didnt say anything about it in the spec is it safe to assume that the simple players will pick a suit before the human player
euchre,so my partner i ran all of our code on caen and then performed the valgrind memory leak test there are 0 bytes neither directly nor indirectly lost however there are 652 bytes possibly lost in 22 blocks how can this happen given that the only dynamic memory directly allocated were the players and do we have to worry about things being possibly lost
euchre,hi all just as a heads up i redistributed my office hours tomorrow so that they arent all in a three hour chunk in the morning they are now 121 230330 and 78 i hope this wont cause any scheduling conflicts please let me know if i can help out at all grace
euchre,im confused about how to represent the cards in a players handi expected hand to be a private vector or array in player seeing as all players have a hand and the operations in player mostly act on that hand is it that we create an array hand for each subclass where should i be keeping track of the cards and who they belong to any help is appreciated
euchre,can i include header sstream sstream is not included in the library list in spec so i was wondering am i allowed to use that
euchre,when testing pack are we to assume that the filename packin will be supplied in the autograder there arent a lot of options for testing packconst stdstring packfilename
euchre,stdarraycard packsize cards can anyone explain this to me how to use it i have no idea thanks
euchre,so this sounds a bit crazy but is it at all possible to iterate through a vector in a circular fashion eg we have players 0 1 2 and 3 we want to do something with players 1 2 3 then 0 all within a single loop instead of doing a forloop for players 13 and having a separate line of code for the action done to player 0 is such a thing possible
euchre,if someone types no shuffle and enters the point as 10 since the point can not be gained in just one round do we need to shuffle the card at the start of a new round
euchre,i keep getting this error for the player factor yet all my virtual functions have been implemented
euchre,can we using assignment rather than using initializer in constructor
euchre,the specs says that when making trump reaches a human player first print out the players hand shall we need to do the printout in the make trump function or just do it in the euchrecpp if a human player is dealer and someone orders up during the first round of making print the players hand and an option to discard the upcard should this step to be done in euchrecpp or we still should do it in playercpp
euchre,i have already include algorithm in my playercpp and try to use sort function but when compile i keep getting no matching function for call to swap and sort3 etc is there a way to fix it
euchre,1 when making trump if the human player is the dealer should we still have the output be human player name please enter a suit or pass seems pretty counterintuitive is the expectation that the human player will ignore the pass portion and type in a valid suit 2 when we display the hand in order during the trick is it in order wrt trump this would be pretty annoying as the sort function i imagine uses our overloading of the and operators which do not account for trump
euchre,during the second round of the human player making trump can it order up the same suit as the upcard from the previous round or does it have to follow the simple player algorithm in this way also will we be playing screw the dealer with the human dealer during round 2
euchre,lets say that a diamond was the upcard in round 1 and nobody orders up is it permissible for a player to order up diamonds in round 2
euchre,so i ran my code through the autograder and even though all of my packtestcpp files compile for me they do not work in the autograder the following is the error output playertestinitializationcpp1818 fatal error packh no such file or directory include packh compilation terminated are we not permitted to use pack objects or functions to help test player im not sure what else is causing this
euchre,there is an error in my code said overloaded operator must be a binary operatorhas 3 parameters what does it mean
euchre,since we can not modify the h file where should we declare the derived classes like the simpleplayer and humanplayer
euchre,why does the spec specify the order of suits to break a tie d c h s as far as i understand this should never be relevant because in all cases either the led suit or trump will take precedence over all others unless this is different from the euchre i play it is impossible to take a trick with a card that is neither trump nor the led suit also why are ranks 27 included in cardh as far as i know they are never used in play thanks
euchre,i am confused that if the addanddiscard function is only for dealer if so should we consider the trump in the implementation of this function and the trump is a global variable for the entire program thanks
euchre,would anyone know why im getting a segmentation fault for packpublictest
euchre,should i be putting private variables in separate inherited classes even thought the variables are both the same can i use protected variables
euchre,im confused about the requirement and public test in this function whether should we return the trump suit or next suit since it can only return one value
euchre,when we discard the lowest value card in hand do we need to worry about led suit to determine which one is lowest
euchre,how can we test our driver euchrecpp efficiently it is working for all 3 examples and works in the autograder but i want to know if there is anything else i can do to make sure it is working fully
euchre,can someone explain how we do shuffle function the two parts we split is not even so how do we swap them
euchre,for the dealone function in packcpp how do we know what the starting value of next is should we just initialize it to zero in the function but if we do that it will be initialized to zero every time the function is called am i missing something obvious thank you
euchre,when i tried to run packpublictest on visual studio i get an unhandled exception badalloc at memory location error and it gave me a break point at my cardgetrank const function in cardcpp does anyone have an idea what this could mean when i ran cardcpp and its tests i didnt get this error i also tried commenting out everything in packcpp that used the getrank function but still got this error thank you
euchre,when i was doing the cardless function i was wondering if i could assume that a and b are different or i still need to check the situation where they are same and then return false
euchre,if a simple player can follow suit they play the highest card that follows suit otherwise they play the lowest card in their hand does this mean the lowest card in their hand considering trump
euchre,could someone please explain the syntax of this line for me stdarraycard packsize cards is the array name cards and it takes in two arguments im confused about how i can push something into the 0 index of this array and then increment and push another thing into the array
euchre,the requirements and restrictions section of the project spec does not list sstream as one of the libraries that we can use however the card public test file uses this library to test the operator function i would think that being able to use ostringstream would be helpful for testing this function in our own tests but i just wanted to make sure that it was left out of the project spec on purpose and not by accident
euchre,is it true that if everyone doesnt pass in first round someone ordered up if someone orders up then we dont call make trump so we dont go to round 2 you get to round 2 if everyone passes round 1
euchre,im getting an issue when i use the sort function i have included the algorithm library in the playerh file when i go to compile the program i get a bunch of errors saying that there is no matching function call to swap within the algorithm library does anyone know whats going on
euchre,im trying to figure out a way to test addcard and addanddiscard functions the players hand is currently in private scope so i cant directly check hand to see if my functions added a card i also cant write a function that will returns a players hand because it wasnt declared in the header file can someone suggest hintsideas for how to check my players hand for my test cases thanks
euchre,when i run my program the file does not open anyone know whats wrong
euchre,im trying to read the file packin in a while loop but the variable im using does not read anything in
euchre,would it be okay to write a helper function in cardscpp to easily find the suit pairs but only use plain strings instead of the const string variables ie diamonds instead suitdiamonds since the variables are member functions
euchre,in packcpp are the cards including all cards or the only cards rank910jqka you can use in the came
euchre,i dont know what the error means or why its occurring
euchre,
euchre,i keep getting this error when running tests for my card file even with card public tests what could be the error
euchre,how does the sort function for vector work exactly wheres the implementation for the sort
euchre,for packcpp i put the class type and then the resolution scope operator and then the name function but i get an error saying undeclared identifier
euchre,for the functions that compare the values of the rhs and lhs in cards do we need to take into consideration both the rank and the suit
euchre,im a bit confused about the function stdstring getsuitconst stdstring trump const the hint says that the left bower is the trump suit this i understand but in the public test for this function it says assertthreespadesgetsuitcardsuitclubs cardsuitspades i dont get why this is true the card rank is three so it wouldnt be the left bower
euchre,for the procedure for addanddiscard the spec states the dealer then discards the lowest card in their hand counting the upcard for a final total of five cards how can we count the upcard when evaluating the lowest card in the hand without making the hand effectively 6 cards which would break the invariant
euchre,in appendix b it describes the make trump process it says that we should prompt the user to enter a suit what if we are in the first round isnt there only one suit to choose from with the other option being to pass so for example the upcard is the jack of diamonds we are in round 1 we print out human player bobs hand and ask him to pick a suit and he types spades should we be outputting some sort of error message to tell the human to enter a valid suit
euchre,hi all sorry because i know that i should know the answer to this but are we supposed to be using the makefile for cardtest ie make cardtest when i try to run my code i get an error for each constexpr saying constexpr only available with stdc11 or stdgnu11 so im assuming i need more arguments to compile it i have no idea any help is much appreciated
euchre,should we be resetting next to 0 in shuffle since it is supposed to only happen at the beginning of the game
euchre,for the maketrump function in playercpp do we have to implement all the various things that occur whether the round is 1 or 2 and whether the player is the dealer such as screw the dealer and swapping the dealers card or is that something that would be implemented in euchrecpp
euchre,so were having an interesting issue where xcode wont allow us to allocate a new simpleplayer as the playerfactory function does because were allocating an object of abstract class type simpleplayer even though weve defined every single function that was abstract in the player class the only function that was not redefined was the player destructor which we actually cant redefine as we cant have a player destructor for the simpleplayer subclass is there something were missing here
exam,does someone know when and how we can submit regrade request i didnt any regrade link on gradescope
exam,midterm exam regrades have been opened and the solutions have been uploaded to the google drive please look over the solutions before submitting a regrade request if after going through the solutions you still feel that your exam has been incorrectly graded then please submit a regrade request through gradescope while you submit regrades for specific questions we reserve the right to regrade your entire exam if you submit a request the deadline for submitting regrade requests is sunday at 800 pm
euchre,should we consider the case where two cards are the exact same rank suit if so what should be the functionality of the and operators in this case if not how is the operator implemented rank only how does the operator function since in a real game of euchre no two cards would be exactly the same
euchre,in our test cases and in our cardcpp file when we refer to a rank or suit can we use the string name or should we use the static variable in the card class for example if i wanted to see if a card called fourhearts had the right values should i use assertfourheartsgetsuit hearts or assertfourheartsgetsuit cardsuithearts i was wondering about this because i didnt know if this broke the rule of respecting the interface of a class
euchre,i am confused about what readpack is supposed to be doing does it read each card for the array cards into packinput
exam,the midterm scores have been released and can be viewed on gradescope the statistic scores can be found in the grade statistics thread 7 regrades are not open yet so please do not try to email us with regrade requests you will submit regrades through gradescope and those will likely be opened tomorrow watch out for another announcement regarding regrades eecs 280 staff

exam,how much do we need to know about scope resolution operators they were a part of lab 4 but i have yet to find them coming up on anything else
exam,if there is a c style string like char ptr someting is that correct ptr refer to whole string while ptr refer to first element in the string
image,
exam,for virtual or pure virtual functions the searching will stop until both a name and signature matching function is found but for nonvirtual functions it will stop whenever a matching name is found is that correct then that can explain in problem 4 since the dynamic type of bobptr is manager but the signature of getraise in manager doesnt match so it will go up find getraise in engineer class which is matched with the expression in main function
exam,for the following question could someone please explain the 3rd question argv
exam,for the following question is the 3rd line necessary if so why where do the instructions specify it
exam,my question regards number 5a in winter 2015 below is the answer provided on the answer key would the following also be correct for the 4th line deptptr studentsi students ini
exam,for 1d the correct answer is string speak const would the following also be correct string speak const
exam,im curious as to whether or not my solution for this would work the answer key shows that they just used the dot operator to access numstudents and students would it also be valid to initialize a pointer to eecsdept as department eecsptr eecsdept and then perform the same for loop by saying i eecsptrnumstudents and eecsptrstudentsi i feel like this should work but i want to double check thanks
exam,is the answer to this questions none because warships constructor does not use ships constructor to initialize numsailors to 0 correct me if im wrong but according to name lookup the compiler looks for a function with the name numsailors in the static type of the pointer ship since its not virtual it tries to execute the numsailors from the ship base class but since the constructor for red october did not use the ships initializing constructor the private member sailors is uninitialized so there would be no output thanks
exam,hi there im wondering if there might be an error in answer key to the second part of question 2 on the midterm review worksheet i put the exact same code into labster and the output was 30 30 5 n 29 4 2 but the answer key says 30 30 60 n 29 59 2 help
exam,i was wondering how we would approach the second part of this problem where it states foo is a pointer to a function that takes a c string and a char as its arguments and returns a double arent pointers to be declared to point at an object with a value by that logic how can a pointer point at a function if functions have no value my first attempt was double foo fstring in char in
exam,the practice questions from the midterm review and the solutions have been uploaded to the google drive under additional resourcesholly note that some of the trickier questions in this document involve material that we wouldnt expect you to know for the midterm particularly name lookup and using the scope resolution operator to call base class functions within a derived class ive also included the source code files in case youd like to download them and compileplay around with the code
exam,in the solution the second condition for both for loops is t and s would an equivalent statementcondition be that t 0 and s 0
exam,in this slide it says that the compiler stops looking for a function whenever a matching name is found does this mean that the signature and return type dont matter so say for example we are declaring an int variable and setting it equal to a member function named x if there are two versions of x one in the derived class that we are first looking in with a return type void and one of type int in the base class would the compiler stop looking in the derived class but then not compile due to a type mismatch sorry that was a bit wordy
exam,could anyone explain why option c is invalid while option d is not it was my understanding that fin only evaluates to true if the stream is in a good state is that last statement inaccurate or what else could be the cause
exam,hi i wanted to know if the exam review session this saturday will be recorded or not
image,i keep testing out my resize driver and it seems to work fine with all the test cases including dog4x5 yet i still fail the autograder test are there any other things i can test for it what should i be looking out for bug wise
exam,could anyone possibly explain why the first option would compile check that the address match but the second one gives a type mismatch are the arrays in the first one both turned into pointers while only the array on the lhs in the second is turned into a pointer if that is the case could someone explain how why that works thanks
image,in our removeverticalseam function do we have to write in a line of code that subtracts the width by one if not how would the seamcarvewidth function know when to stop
image,in imageinit when i write out is to read in the values it gives me an error saying that no operator matches these operands i already have include fstream
image,how should i go about testing image getpixel i tried printing out the pixel in the test function but that didnt work i also tried to create a pixel correct and compare using assert but it wouldnt let me do that either
image,both dog and crabster run wonderfully and fast but horses takes a ridiculous amount of time to process so long in fact that i havent actually had it finish any of the resizings i dont have any extraneous code and my matrixat function is succinct are there any other locations in particular that might slow down the program that i should check
image,i try running processing public test on the terminal and then select dog but then it just does nothing after can anyone help
image,anyone else able to pass all the tests in this file except the final seamcarve test im confused as to how i can pass all of them but not seamcarve since the other functions are part of seam carve
image,i tried to call matrixat in imageprint as well as set and get pixels but i got an unresolved external symbol error what could be causing this
image,i keep running into an issue where when i rotate files that are not square it cuts off the oblong portion and only rotates a square section im assuming its because the new image isnt large enough but how can i change this without editing the rotateleft function

image,i got a 01 for this on the autograder was publicresizetest something that was given to us im not sure how to debug this
image,how do you test the matrixmax function do we have to create a matrix ourselves in the testcpp manually and then see if the function returns the max value if so how should i go about making the matrix
image,when i test this function i got similar outputs but it still fails assert when i compare the two strings and i eliminated all white spaces i used diff checker and it said they were the same
image,im confused the spec says you cannot change the width of an image but when i run the test for removing the seam the resulting removedimgcorrect has a smaller width the spec says we should copy into a smaller auxiliary image then into the original image but i dont understand how this would change the width if it says right above that we cant change the width of an image
image,when i type the command line arguments and the output file doesnt exist it just creates a file instead of printing out the error message is this ok
image,is it ok if a library is included but none of the functions in the library are used for example in one of my files i have included the cassert library but have not used any functions from it but there is a possibility i might is it ok to leave it even if it is not used
image,whenever i try to compile in terminal im getting an error segmentation fault 11 and it doesnt execute
image,i am really confused about the correct seam outputs outputs attached are given in the starter folder based on my understandings isnt the correct output supposed to be 0 2 2 2 1 since on the handout spec it says we need to return the leftmost lowest cost for every row in the cost matrix can anyone clarify this for me thanks in advance
statistics,do we need to write a test case for print that can be submitted to the autograder or can i write code and output it using the print function and then visually analyze it to determine that my print functions are working as intended if the second option is allowed would it be best to then comment out that test and leave it in the code so that other users will understand that i have tested my print function or should i then delete the code after determining that it is printing the expected output
image,dose any one passed publicresizetest please let me know if you passedjust to make sure its not the fault of autograder iv submitted several version of resizecpp none of them cab pass publicresizetest iv tested every edgy case i can imagine and dose this test depends on the rest of my program or it will use a correct version of other files in order to prevent cascade errors thanks
image,resizecpp8913 error cannot resolve overloaded function ‘isopen’ based on conversion to type ‘bool’ if foutisopen resizecpp8913 error in argument to unary resizecpp9413 error statement cannot resolve address of overloaded function foutclose does someone know whats going on here
image,when i tried to run the processing public function in xcode it always stops at the testremoveseam function the code paused at the code cout testing prefix remove seam flush saying thread 1 excbadaccess but my codes ran well when it goes through the energy cost and find seam functions i was wondering whats going wrong here
image,any strategies on how to best proceed and debug this im getting segmentation faults when i try to run crabster dog or horses it doesnt say anything else other than segmentation fault
image,when one of the rules is broken for the command line arguments are we supposed to cout both error statements or just the appropriate one for example if theres 6 command line arguments should usage resizeexe infilename outfilename width height only be printed or should both statements be printed
image,i was trying to create an array and pass it as a parameter of this function but it gave me this compile error it seems that i have to specify the length of array without using a variable to specify the length but i have no idea how to fix it this is what i did int seamimg height 1 any help is appreciated
image,i am confused why the output of the matrixpublictestcpp in the linux was like the below with many numbers ahead anybody know the reason thanks
image,matrix and image here are all struct and all the members are accessible so why we still need the functions like these matrixwidth
image,how could we make an assert statement for this in our matrixrow function or do we not need to i thought we had to make an assert statement for the requires clause of each function
image,for computeverticalcostmatrix the second step is fill in costs for the first row index 0 the cost for these pixels is just the energy what would the energy of these pixels be since they dont have a north pixel and some dont have east or west pixels
image,are we allowed to include testhelpersh in our implementation for processingcpp to assert some of the requires clauses
image,i have my seamcarve as putting both seamcarvewidth and height in however when i run the public test it says that it doesnt match so then i was trying to find the difference but i found that dog4x5correct and dogremovedcorrect are exactly identical even though dogremovedcorrect is the file for when only seamcarvewidth is applied is this an error in the correct file or is the seamcarveheight not suppose to take any columns off for the dog file
image,inimagepublictestcpp there is a function pixelequal called in an assert statement but i cant find it defined in any of the other files we were given are we supposed to write this function ourselves
image,when i tried to run matrixpublictestcpp i ended up with this error can anyone explain to me what does this error mean
image,when i wrote imagetestscpp i used dogppm am i allowed to use the some starting file in my tests
image,when i do matrix and image public test i got this out for each function i implement undefined reference to some function does someone know what does this mean
image,when i declare an array in seamcarvewidth function can i give it a big enough number as a size of array i know the height of image would be enough but since its a variable so i cant use it as a size index
statistics,is anyone experiencing the problem of being unable to compile the make command for matrixpublictest i redownloaded the makefile from the google drive and am still experiencing this error
image,there are two matrixat one is const the other one is not but the problem is they have exactly same name whenever i want to write this function it always refer to the const one what should i do if i want to use the other one
image,when will the autograder for project 2 be posted
image,when i try to compile a processing test the terminal points to where i initialize the seam array in seamcarvewidth and gives me the error error variable length arrays are a c99 feature
image,when i run processing public tests it gives me deriveddataproject 2 image processingbuildproductsdebugproject 2 image processing dogcrabsterhorses program ended with exit code 1 what do i do
image,i dont know why i am not able to use dot operator to get the element in struct like imgsomething the error says expression must have class type
image,im a little confused with redchannel and blue and green so does matrix redchannel basically contains an array of all the values of red of each pixel so if i had a 3x3 all filled with red pixels would redchannel array look like this 255255255255255255255255255 with the first element corresponding to the first pixel and the second to the second pixel in the image
image,i keep getting an error that says undefined reference to function the compiler seems to be complaining that i havent declared any of the functions but ive already included both the image and matrix headers in the public test file
image,what is the max run time allowed for resizing ive passed all the public test cases and when i run my program from the command line it works quite fast to resize dogppm but for crabsterppm and horsesppm it takes 30min
image,in the driver file how can we get the original height and width of the file
image,clarification question if i call the function with columnstart 0 and columnend 1 does this mean that the minvalue in whatever row this was called is simply whatever element is at columnstart because columnend is exclusive so were left with really only 1 column
image,what exactly do the redchannel greenchannel bluechannel matrix objects represent
image,how do we provide a command line interface into resizecpp
image,this is kind of a big picture question about the way this project is designed rather than an actually question about how to do it lets say we have an image that has lots of energy in the center but low energy on the left and right sides at the top of the picture the left side has a lower energy than the right side so thats where we start to find the vertical seam since the middle of the picture has very high energy once the seam starts on the left it really cant cross over to the right even if at the bottom of the picture the left side ends up having relatively high energy as long as the center is always higher than the left the seam will not get to the right side so the high energy center functions like a barrier but perhaps the right side has an overall lower cost starts a little bit higher but is consistently pretty low and therefore makes a better seam so i get that this project is already complicated enough but if we wanted to make an even better contentaware image resizing program wouldnt we want to deal with this possibility perhaps by calculating various possible seams and selecting the one that has the lowest overall cost
image,does someone know what these stand for is that the name of file are passed into the function
image,i have to say this algorithm is awesome but im wondering why removing the least energy seam wouldnt change the image of original picture
image,my processingpublictestsexe finished essentially instantly for dogs and crabsters but its been running testing horses seam carve 300x382 for about 25 minutes now i cant see any way to make it run faster without altering the seamcarvewidth header in processingh so is this just how long its meant to take
image,what are we supposed to do with the extra column of pixels that remain on the right side of the original image when the seam is removed the spec says that there is no way to change the width of an existing image so should the leftover pixels just be set to black
image,im trying to test the processing functions using the public tests and whenever i call the testrotate function in the testall implementation i get a segmentation fault when the testrotate function is commented out there is no longer a segmentation fault what could be causing this since we did not modify the implementation of any code above the line in processingcpp screenshot20160514at112213ampng screenshot20160514at112206ampng
image,trying to compile the processing public tests and in both terminal xcode getting the following error any idea where this is coming from its in some algorithm file
image,in the imagecpp file can we include the matrixh library
image,if we were returning something from the first row would we print 0 or 1 are the rowscolums index 0 or index 1
image,we are getting this error when we try to compile our matrixcpp file does anyone know what this error means and how to fix it
image,in the imageinit functions is it also necessary to initialize the three matrices inside img as well also for the second imageinit function where we read in values from a ppm file do we just initialize the image with the width and height or is it necessary to read in all the matrix values from the ppm file and input them into their respective matrices
image,my partner and i finished matrixcpp imagecpp and processingcpp but when we tried to run the public test we got a weird error that we arent sure how to interpret we made sure that all the necessary files were excluded from the build can anyone help
image,ptr points to an elements index right so if the element is element 3 then ptr would equal 3
image,would it be okay to test multiple matrixcpp functions in a single test function for instance test the width column at and print all in one function since they would all act on the same matrix thanks
image,hi all just a quick note since i forgot to mention this in lecture with the material from today weve now covered everything that gets used on the project thanks james
image,i just tried running xcode to see if it would compile and this error comes up thanks
image,is there some way to upload an entire folder at once to mfile
image,in the starter code why is the attribute int datamaxmatrixwidth maxmatrixheight a onedimensional array when the matrix is supposed to be two dimensional not sure if im missing something obvious here or if im not thinking about matrices right thank you
statistics,how to print summarize on main i keep getting errors when i have coutsummarizedata please explain
statistics,in class it was mentioned to we were expected to test for mistakes but not for machiavellian errors in addition to running statstests ive tested on the real data file on 15 columns with complete correctness is this considered adequate testing or should we be looking for bad data as well is bad data considered machiavellian or a mistake
statistics,in the project style guidelines it says that all functions you write must have an rme clause see lecture 2 slides the rmes are already included in the header files but do we still need to include them in our cpp files
statistics,in the caenlinux file in quick references it says that after working on the project on our computers we have to copy your completed project files from your local computer to your directory on caen linux how exactly would i do this
statistics,hi i still cannot locate the real data tsv file i have read through all related piazza posts and the announcement i have tried to download the files manually through the links in the announcement through the original link on the spec and all links that have been posted on piazza relating to my issue i have tried all of these links while both signed into my umich account and a basement ugli caen computer is there any other way to download the file some relevant text from terminal bash42 unzip icpsr30103zip archive icpsr30103zip extracting icpsr30103termsofusehtml extracting icpsr3010330103manifesttxt extracting icpsr3010330103relatedliteraturetxt extracting icpsr3010330103descriptioncitationpdf inflating icpsr30103ds0001301030001codebookpdf inflating icpsr30103ds0001301030001questionnairepdf these are the only things being unzipped i think the tsv file should be here this text is unchanged if i download the delimited version the direct link from the announcement and the exceltsv download link
statistics,when running the mode and summarize test cases the assert fails and it says that vector iterator offset out of range does anyone know what this means
statistics,if i dont want to connect to caen from my personal computer would it work if i copied the files into a usb drive and downloaded them onto a caen computer
statistics,so i got my summarize function to work but im confused about how we are supposed to print out the values of the vectors in maincpp thank you
statistics,when i am trying to use the given sort function it keeps saying that the identifier is undefined i have even included p1libraryh i am using it as so sortv does anyone know what i might be doing wrong
statistics,for the summarize function should we use the pushback function
statistics,1 for curly braces i was consistent within individual files in the test cases i copied the format of the sample test case provided which put curly braces on their own separate line under the function however in my main and stats files i used formatting that put curly braces on the same line as the function is that okay i did not want to change the sample test case that was there 2 the style guide states we must provide rme clauses for all functions we write however for the stats file the h file provided already lists all the rme clauses is it necessary then to copy the rme clauses from here for the stats functions i wrote
statistics,do we have to put comments on the same lines as their statements in this case my lines will be long over 80 characters can we put comments on the top of their statements
statistics,i still cant find the tsv file in real data i tried downloading the files in caen and in windows i tried downloading the exceltsv files
statistics,i have everything working as far as i can see both on my computer and in linux except when i run the makefile test suite it goes through all of the tests and give me this error at the end the autograder also gives me 0 points for the main file what might be happening here
statistics,for the percentile function if theres only one element would we just return that element itself
statistics,if the vector has only one element does that vector act as a min and max
statistics,i know its difficult to say but approximately how many test cases should we have there are some functions for example the min one where i cant think of any edge or unique cases is it still advised that i write a basic test case ie vector 1 2 3 for it or is that not necessary
statistics,i get the following error in the autograder im using codeblocks with c 11 compiler and i dont get any errors or warnings it compiles just fine my variable modev is initialized as double modev at the top of my mode function the line in my code the error refers to is returnmodev at the end
statistics,im getting an error when i try to compile my summarize function i currently have the declaration as vector vectordouble summarizevectordouble v with a return type that is declared as vector vectordouble summary stuff but im getting an unresolved external symbol error it looks like im returning the same type that is asked for in the statsh file any thoughts
statistics,is there a standard format we should use to write out file descriptions or should we just make sure to include our names and project 1 also could the rmes for our functions in statscpp be the same as the rmes in the statsh file thanks
statistics,what type of return does the summarize functions returns
statistics,im trying to go through my stats tests through my caen account and im sure i have all the files saved in mfile and ive compiled using the make command but whenever i use the statstests command it says permission denied
statistics,hi so i finished all functions almost done with main and all i have left is the summarize function would some one briefly explain how should i start on it in statscpp vectorvectordouble summarizevectordouble v
statistics,are there any style guides which we can follow i checked the style guide link in the specification of project 1 but one of the ias told me that was the old one for c can anyone upload the new one thanks
statistics,when i tried to test my maincpp after i entered the filename and column it kept telling me that error opening maintestdatatsv i do upload my tsv file in my folder is there any way to fix it
statistics,in the linux my compilation output was the same as the give correct one but the autograder kept telling me that the output was incorrect the following is the result in the linux anybody know where is the difference and why the output was incorrect
statistics,should we write a new function for each case to test each stats function or could we include multiple tests in one function for each stats function for example if i wanted to see if the sum function in statscpp worked for adding up x y z case 1 and a b c d case 2 should i write two different void functions in statstestscpp or can a single function include two assertions one for each case thanks
statistics,my code runs fine on the public test case on xcode but the autograder gives it no points what is going on
statistics,ive passed the all the public autograder tests without changing the default precision will that same default precision be okay for any private tests the autograder runs
statistics,in the autograder feedback when i see testcount testsum testsum so on does it mean i implemented them right in the below image i see every function other than testsummarize does that mean i got every function right except summarize
statistics,i cannot find the tsv file after unzipping the zip file downloaded from the internet did anybody find the tsv file where is it thanks this is the picture of what inside the zip file without seeing the tsv
statistics,i submitted my statstestcpp to the autograder and got this it looks like my statstestcpp did not compile becauce of using fabs so shouldnt i be using fabs
statistics,i keep getting an unused and undeclared variables error even though the variables are clearly declared and used sometimes in the same line the error is in
statistics,i just went through the lecture slide of checking the requires clause do we need to check requires of functions such as stdev function in this project
statistics,i keep getting multiple errors that look like this when i compile my driver file even when all i have in the file is a hello world cout statement i even commented out the include vector library the make file is correct and the statscpp and stats tests files both work fine and h files are all included
statistics,when i write out the equation on the project spec for percentile it gives me the output 0th percentile 7 25th percentile 8 50th percentile 9 75th percentile 10 100th percentile 163e322 but when i used the exact same equation but take out the 1 when calculating n i get the right answer is the equation wrong
statistics,im a bit confused by the h files statsh and p1libraryh and how these work for example in p1libraryh there is a function for extracting one column of data from a tab separated values file tsv stdvectordouble extractcolumnstdstring filename stdstring columnname is that just a header for a function we need to write to extract a column or can we actually just use that one line of code in our maincpp file to extract the column of interest from our inputed file
statistics,how do we set up a test case for summarize it is not like the test case that was provided and the output is a vector of vectors
statistics,judging by the rme for the mode function is it safe to assume that if a vector has an equal frequency of two numbers say 1 2 1 2 then the mode is the lesser of the two values i didnt see this anywhere in the wiki page provided but i might have missed it thanks
statistics,stdvectordouble extractcolumnstdstring filename stdstring columnname for the above function provided that extracts a column of data from tab separated value what is the name of the matrix that holds the extracted column in other words the function extracts this column of numbers but where do they go or how can i assign them into a vector
statistics,i dont have a working knowledge of how standard deviation or percentile work and without either of these i dont feel comfortable trying to write a function for it i tried reading the provided reading material but those offered relatively little clarity can someone explain how either of these formulas work please
statistics,i tried to compile my test cases in statstestscpp with given command but the result was like these g error statstestscpp no such file or directory g error statscpp no such file or directory g error p1librarycpp no such file or directory g fatal error no input files compilation terminated what went wrong here
statistics,is a valid way to compare two vectors
statistics,i cant find anything in the spec that says if two numbers appear the same number of times what mode should output as
statistics,how can i open a file without include fstream without it i keep getting an incomplete type error
statistics,how should i use statspublictestscpp it seems like i should compile it with statscpp and p1librarycpp but i get errors when i try to do so in visual studio the errors all look like this cstatscpp error c4716 percentile must return a value background in statscpp i only have function stubs of the kind described in the project outline like so double percentilevectordouble v double p assertfalse i dont know why the code i have necessarily should compile but the outline describes statspublictestscpp as a does my code compile test case and function stubs as functions that dont do anything useful but do compile is this an ide problem or am i misunderstanding the outline
statistics,i created a statscpp file and tried to link the statsh file by putting include statsh but it keeps telling me that it cannot open source file statsh can someone help me with this
statistics,i followed all instructions in spec but there is no such tsv file anyone succeeded to find that file
statistics,my project has been working perfectly on my computer but when i submitted it to the autograder it points to all my for loops where i use vsize v being the passed vector and giving me the error comparison between signed and unsigned integer expression
statistics,i dont understand how i am supposed to write the test cases so they are generic for any input i dont even understand the testsumsmalldataset test that is already in statstestscpp what am i supposed to write
statistics,for comparison assertion can we use fabs
statistics,my mean function crashes if the mean values decimals go beyond the tenths place is there a way for me to fix this
statistics,effects returns the count of the numbers in v int countstdvectordouble v do you mean the number of distinct values or the total number of values when you say count of the numbers
statistics,hi my statstests file compiles perfectly on the linux in caen but fails in the autograder and points to a helper function i created im suspecting its because the autograder uses its own statsh file would this be the case
statistics,when we implement maincpp do the prompts for file name column name etc have to be identical to those in the project specifications
statistics,screenshot20160505at35143pmpng screenshot20160505at35219pmpng im attempting to download the icpsr statistics from the given link on the spec and for some reason the tsv file is not downloading with the rest of the folder ive attached relevant screenshots below ive created an account and everything is there any way the tsv file can just be posted on the google drive
statistics,whats the standard heading were supposed to have on all files that we submit for the autograder does 33 mean full credit for the entire project thanks
statistics,im trying to extract column b from the maintestdatatsv file and even though im spelling everything correctly the extractcolumn function that i am calling is returning an error opening the file im trying to open the data by using extractcolumnfilename colname filename and colname arguments are local variables i have defined and inserted a string into using cin is there something that im missing here that may be prompting the error not sure what it is but i think it has to be something minor
statistics,im having trouble getting my statscpp to compile with the given statspublictestcpp in my statscpp file ive included include statsh as well as all the libraries with functions i used and i also included using namespace std these are the errors im getting one for each function please point me in the right direction
statistics,i have a problem when i log into autograder it says i am not enrolled into any class do i need to worry about that or its just because its not open yet
statistics,in the statsh file it says stdvectorstdvectordouble summarizestdvectordouble v is that also a function we have to implement thank you
statistics,the statistics pdf references two files called statscpp and maincpp but neither of those files are in the starter files folder or in the zip will they be posted later or do we have to build them from scratch thanks
statistics,hi all i hope youre excited to be starting project 1 one thing that i really struggled with when i was in 280 was working with caen from my local computer if youre using a mac here are some stepbystep instructions for one way to handle this project note this is only one way to do it there are lots of other ways to work with caen and linux that you can read about in the quick references section of google drive working locally this just means you are working on your own computer in your own filesystem not through caen work on xcode sublime or whatever idetext editor you prefer save all of your files within one folder navigate to that folder using your terminal using the cd and ls commands xcode note if your project is called 280p1 your files might be in another folder called 280p1 that is inside of the project folder 280p1 you can use ls after each cd to see if you’re in the correct folder yet this is what happened with my project you can see it in the screenshot below here is a screenshot of my terminal i had saved my project on desktop so the first two commands i had typed were cd desktop and cd 280p1 everything after in this screenshot are things that i had typed notice that i was already in my 280p1 directory and when i typed ls i saw that within that directory there was another 280p1 directory when i cded into that and then displayed the files within it thats where i found all of my project files once you are in that folder you can compile and use the command line instructions and make that are in the spec mfile once you feel like your code is all working properly and you’re ready to test it in a caen environment navigate to httpsmfileumichedu and create a new folder the actions pane on the lefthand side has “create a new folder” and “upload files” which you will need you may want to make a folder called eecs280 and a folder inside of that called project1 or something of that sort organize it however you would like upload all of the files you have in your local project folder to your project1 folder or however you decided to organize it the “upload files” action will only take 5 files at a time so this part may be a little tedious but after you’re done all of your files are copied over to your caen account it is important to note that those files are copies and when you change the files on your local computer the files in caen are not automatically changed so you will need to reupload them if you are using this method heres what mine looks like note my very old eecs280 folder back from my freshman year ssh then last step head back to your terminal at the command line type ssh uniqnameloginenginumichedu without the single quotes and replace uniqname with your own uniqname this will prompt you for your password go ahead and enter it it should be the same one you use for all logins you do with your uniqname through um it will look like you’re not typing but just type your password and then hit enter heres what my screen looks like at this point if it succeeds you are now sshed if you type ls it should display all the files and folders that are in your home directory you should hopefully see the eecs280 folder you created on mfile cd into that and then cd into your project1 folder again if thats how you organized it heres what my terminal window looks like at that point if you type ls now you should see all of the project files you uploaded woo now you can compile and use make the same way you did earlier but you are now within a caen environment type exit when youre done using ssh to go back to your local computer remember that any changes you make locally or on caen will not automatically change the copies so you may need to reupload files if you make changes hopefully this helps again this is just one of many ways to work with caen and linux but i hope it will be helpful for getting started
statistics,i was asserting my percentile function for 3 and got 46 my assertion statement failed and when i debugged it i found out that the percentile value returned was 46000000000005 is my function wrong or is there something i should be doing
statistics,does anyone know when the autograder for project 1 will be opened
statistics,im a bit confused about linux is that something we need to download
