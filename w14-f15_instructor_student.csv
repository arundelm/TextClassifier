instructor,a graduate student is looking for volunteers to participate in a research effort that is attempting to improve on android security if you are interested here is the link to a form to express your interest in participation httpgooglp008sw the phd student who is conducting the study is earlence fernandes earlenceumichedu and his office is in the cse division the study has an irb approval from the university of michigan he will do a raffle at the end of study the winner gets 50 amazon gift card if you dont win even then you will probably learn a little bit about potential security issues on android and smartphones and benefit a phd students research work from what i am told you will need to spend around 20 minutes of time using the students android device the study is somewhat like a little game in that you have to try to guess correctly as to when you are interacting with a genuine program and when you are interacting with a malicious program feel free to contact earlence with more questions or simply enter your information in the form and he will contact you if you are selected any personal information you provide is destroyed at the end of the study as per the irb rules prof prakash
instructor,weve modified the schedule a bit for the last few lectures mon 14 apr extra help and practice problems wed 16 apr extra help and practice problems ringenberg lecture canceled mon 21 apr final exam review pin
instructor,in the cse department we take our course evaluations very seriously and we want to encourage everyone to participate we would like to extend an opportunity for extra credit equivalent to one lab assignment for those who submit a course evaluation evaluations remain anonymous and we will only know that you submitted so we can give you credit to receive extra credit equivalent to one lab assignment complete your course evaluation for eecs 280 and forward the registrars email acknowledgement to eecsevalsumichedu pin
instructor,we clarified in the specs that rational0 0 results in 00 there was a bit of ambiguity in the original specs the change in the project5pdf from the original version is highlighted in yellow and q is nonzero this is a new project do let us know if you see any specs errors or ambiguities pin
instructor,the specs for project 5 have been released get started early unlike other projects it is due on a tuesday apr 22nd the assignment requires you to implement three classes a doublylinked list stack and a rational number class in addition you have to implement a postfix calculator for rational numbers you will be making use of many of the concepts we talked about in recent lectures including classes friends operator overloading function pointersfunctors the big three dynamic memory etc if you have never encountered a postfix calculator before and want to ask us questions about it please stop by in office hours we can show you some online calculators here are a few that i am aware of an online javascriptbased calculator httpwwwueaacukdpscalculatorhtml mac oss builtin calculator search for calculator in spotlight after you launch the calculator select view rpn mode a picture of it is attached in action after i entered two numbers 3 and 5 if i were to hit the sign at that point the two numbers would be added and then 8 put on the stack use this calculators to understand rpn mode but unlike these calculators your calculator will be textbased entirely and use rational number arithmetic happy coding
instructor,disclaimer its not actually a party its just extra office hours
instructor,dear students since so few of you have attended our recent office hours that must mean you are all finished with project 4 therefore we the staff have decided to cancel all office hours up until the project 4 deadline sincerely eecs 280 staff
instructor,as was pointed out by a student and discussed with staff we are allowing test case collaboration for project 3 there are currently a few different posts on piazza related to this topic while this provides great feedback to you and confirmation with regards to correctness i strongly encourage you to perform your own testing first and convince yourself of the results before comparing with others in the working world testing is a crucial part of any project and the stakes are much higher generally speaking it is strongly advised to spend as much time on testing as was spent on coding and some companies even have dedicated teams just for testing and test automation purposes testing is a crucial skill to have and admittedly quite hard to master but with practice you should all be able to also a friendly reminder this policy does not apply for project 4 as test cases are a deliverable for that project and such collaboration would lead to a violation of the honor code
instructor,several students have been having issues where their code seems to work fine when testing locally but doesnt pass the tests when submitted to the autograder in the project spec we suggest using something like this to test your code euchre packin noshuffle 1 alice bob cathy drew euchretest00out diff ­q euchretest00out euchretest00outcorrect these should be run as two separate commands it wont work if you type it out all on one line it wont find any differences and your code will appear to be producing correct output when its not of course you should also make sure youre testing on caen linux and are using a fresh copy of the sample correct outputs in case you accidentally modified them

instructor,hi my car is stuck in snow and wont budge ill be a few minutes late to discussion please start working on the lab ill be there as soon as i can pooja
instructor,i talked about an intset factory in the 500 pm lecture yesterday march 12th for those of you following my lecture attached is the code for the functions to help create an intset object and for destroying the object this helps completely the implementation of intset from maincpp note that maincpp only needs to include the two factory functions signature defined as part of intsetfactoryh and the pure abstract ie interface class intsetcpp the code on slide 15 of lecture 16 notes is somewhat simplified it does not completely hide the intsetunsorted class from maincpp since the header file is included by using factory functions it is possible to completely hide the implementation from maincpp the makefile includes the command to compile the code the factory code does require the use of newdelete two operations for creating and destroying objects dynamically we will talk more about them in coming weeks prakashlecture16codezip
instructor,it may be helpful to have a general idea of c operators and their precedence i am not sure if it is on the tomorrows exam but there are problems on the past exams that depended on it here are some rules 1 and post eg x where x is a pointer it could mean either x or x c gives higher precedence to the operator thus it means x this is explicitly in lecture 7 on slides 3538 so you should know that int p10 int x p now what does x do this means x is dereferenced x ie p0 is the value of the expression then x the pointer is incremented a subsequent x would give you p1 here are a few others that could be confusing 2 ab in the above there are two possible meanings ab or ab in c it is the former 3 ab means ab 4 ab means ab 5 ab means ab in your own code i suggest using parenthesis to avoid confusion but if you see something like this on an exam you now know what it means a full table is given below httpencppreferencecomwcpplanguageoperatorprecedence in the above a is frequently used in the lectures and in the labs so it is a good idea to know that in case a problem shows up with that notation pin
instructor,for those of you who havent left town yet i will still be holding my friday office hours feb 28th if youre around i highly recommend that you that you use this opportunity to get your project into a good position going into spring break vidal

instructor,if you are still struggling with packinit here are some hints i tried to address the points of confusion i am seeing in several of the questions regarding the function reading 1 you can read from file streams just like from cin 2 read c strings string type assume that file streams can only read c strings not cstrings directly converting from c strings to cstrings the problem you will face next is that the interface to the cardinit functions expects either enumerated type card and suit or cstyle strings const char but what you just read in were c strings they are not compatible a conversion is required from the c strings to either the enumerated type of cstyle strings in this case it is easer to simply convert c strings to cstrings use the scstr method whenever you need to convert from a c string s to its cstring representation following is an example char a scstr a is a cstring pointer it points to the internal representation of cstring in c string s or char amaxsize you create a cstring array strcpya scstr copy the c strings internal representation of cstring to your own private copy casting casting cannot be arbitrary the following would be bad as an example suit s staticcastsuitspades bad runtime error the problem is suit is an enumerated type that has integer values ranging from 0 to 3 corresponding to the four suits thus the only valid casts are from values 0 to 3 the following are more examples suit s staticcastsuit0 legal suit s staticcastsuit3 legal suit s staticcastsuit4 bad likely runtime error staticcast operator only tells the compiler to suspend its type checking for that statement the runtime system will attempt to interpret the number 4 or the character pointer to the cstring spades as an enumerated type but since the value does not lie in the range 0 to 3 your code will misbehave from that point on if you are lucky you will get a bus error segmentation fault etc so how do you go from the a cstring s that contains spades to its the enumerated type value spades you got to compare strings use the strcmp function

instructor,while you should do your final testing on caen linux machines many of you may be doing initial development on the macs here are some things that may be useful to get close to the linux toolset on mavericks the latest version of mac os install the commandline tools in xcode by going to xcodes preferences this gives you g and a debugger called lldb lldb replaces gdb on mac to use the debugger you need to add the g flag to g you can modify the given makefile and add g to the various commands and then do make or make packtest00 etc to make the desired executable debugger will be useful in case you get segmentation faults or aborts to run the debugger do the following lldb executablefile for example lldb packtest00 this should give you the lldb prompt then the key commands are lldb run executes the program lldb bt shows the call stack where your program the above is useful in the event that on running your program it crashes this is similar to gdbs where command lldb b functionname set a breakpoint in the given function setting breakpoints can be useful to pause the program a few lines before it crashes then once it pauses you can use the following commands to step through the program or examine the variables lldb next go to the next line in the same function lldb step go to the next instruction lldb print variablename print a value lldb cont continue on till next breakpoint or till program ends it is possible to install gdb as well using macport or brew but it should not be necessary if you use the above commands a full correspondence between lldb and gdb can be found at httplldbllvmorglldbgdbhtml pin

instructor,hi class if you are feeling up the task try your hand at writing a reversedeal program to help you test your euchre program here is the general idea in your main function you declare 4 arrays of 5 cards each ie 4 x card5 one array for each player set the values of each of the cards in each array to be the cards that you want each player to have in hisher hand this is the tricky part write code that takes these hands and places them into an array of 24 cards ie card24 such that if dealt using the 32322323 technique each player will have the original hands that you specified have your program output each card in the card24 array to a file use this new file as a custombuilt input file for your euchre program make several such input files that cover a variety of scenarios this is a very useful program to have handy i did exactly this when i was writing the autograder test cases vidal

instructor,i will attempt to occasionally share advanced optional material for students hungry for especially challenging topics that relate to eecs 280 material this material is completely optional and is intended for the advanced student who seeks additional challenges most of the material will generate more questions than answers bleeding edge which brings me to this weeks topic recall the recurring theme of eecs 280 and c its easy to shoot yourself in the foot the compiler will happily let you commit egregious errors worse the observable outcome of egregious errors varies by computer operating system anddrum roll compiler so whats the deal with these undefined behaviors who decides what a compiler can do for cases when the outcome of a c operation is undefined read a paper from mit called towards optimizationsafe systems analyzing the impact of undefined behavior published at the famous acm symposium on operating systems principles sosp a question to ponder now that you know compilers have weird undefined behavior how might you write a testing program to tease out security vulnerabilities assuming the testing program has access to the source code and compiled binary to analyze knows exactly what compiler was used to create the binary has access to the source code of that compiler can itself parse c and can automatically generate test cases the output of the testing program should be an input that causes a security exploitation in a binary think about it
instructor,unfortunately i have a family emergency so i will not be able to make it to my office hours today i apologize for the inconvenience

instructor,hi all by an unfortunate coincidence it turns out that a common mistake in the computational procedure for project 1 leads to numbers for the example given in the spec that are very close to the correct ones off by a few hundredths traditionally this has caused a bit of confusion as to whether it could just be a rounding issue but it does actually mean there is a conceptual mistake in the way your code does the calculations good luck and happy coding

instructor,by now windows users are probably wishing they could have one of those wonderful linux terminals on their home computer cygwin is exactly that its a downloadable bash shell terminal im going to quickly walk you through the optimal installation and include some quicktips installation 1 download the appropriate setup file from httpscygwincominstallhtml 2 run the setup file click the next button with the radio button on install from internet click next again 3 select your preferred installation directory in the root directory option remember where its installed well need that later click next 4 the local package directory is just where setup will download files it needs for installation pick where you want it i left it in the downloads folder click next 5 have the radio dial selected on direct connection and click next again 6 the available download sites is just picking which server you want to download the files from it doesnt matter too much where you download it just speed of download avoid servers that are hosted overseas because theyll take longer i selected httpcygwinmirrorspaircom click next 7 wait for the cygwin setup select packages menu to appear this menu is for downloading the additional toolssoftware you want to have access too from cygwin things like emacsvim g etc by default cygwin will force you to rerun this entire installation process to get more packages but were better than that were going to setup a package manager this will allow us to in the future download new tools with just a simple terminal command 8 at the top of the menu theres a search box in order to install a particular package you should type the name in the search box and the category options should reduce in the explorer below you can expand the category by click the button to see the associated packages in this case were going to exemplify with the package wget so if you search for it you end up with four categories one can infer which category it actually falls in but lets assume we dont know where it is expand all the categories then in the package column you can see the full package name we want wget which we can see is under the web category clicking on skip will change it to the version number to install in this example it changed to 11631 as shown below 9 install the following packages web wget base tar archive bzip2 editors vim editors emacs click next make sure select requied packages is checked off and click next again it will now install this will take a bit click finish when it does 10 run cygwin yay a terminal but were not done yet we want a package manager so run the following commands wget rawgitcomtranscodeopenaptcygmasteraptcyg install aptcyg bin 11 you can now install packages using the aptcyg program notice how the name is similar to aptget for linux heres some examples that youll probably want for 280 281 aptcyg install gccg aptcyg install make aptcyg install gdb theres tons more you can do but this should allow you to get moving quick tips cygwin runs a local linux structured file directory which you can find in the installation directory of cygwin ie dcygwin64homeusername homemaxsd000 if you want to open a file with your systems default application run the following command this example opens up a pdf viewer adobe reader cygstart project5pdf if you want to access a terminal program that you have installed on your main machine but not cygwin we can create a symbolic link to reference it read more about this on google in this example were going to get access to a latex compiler the general structure for a link is ln s source target here the source would be the file you want to link to eg the path to latexexe and the target is the file we want to link the source to on cygwin its logical to put things in your bin folder so you can instantly get universal access to the program full example ln s cprogram files x86miktex 29miktexbinx64latexexe usrlocalbinlatex now we can build latex pdfs as follows in cygwin pdflatex exampletex pin

instructor,just because ive seen many of these types of posts here are some consolidated steps you should take if your code compiles on your end but not on the autograder 1 does it really compile on your end ie are you using the unmodified makefile that we provided and the correct command to compile 1935 2 do you have unmodified h files redownload to make sure 3 are you valgrind clean 1878 has good discussion about this see the end of the project 3 spec for more information 4 are you using a library or include h file or include a cpp you shouldnt dont do that 5 are you failing your own test cases oops better look at that 6 if you get to here and you cant figure it out do post a question or come to office hours a staff member can look up your submit and hopefully point you in the right direction pin
instructor,hi class i wanted to take an opportunity to debrief all of you that participated in the labster maize vs labster blue study first of all thank you for your participation we were able to learn a lot and have some pretty interesting results labster blue visualized a conceptual model of subcall execution and recursion similar to what is used in most contemporary program visualization systems labster maize visualized a different conceptual model prior to this study there was little evidence to suggest one would necessarily be superior to the other it turns out that labster maize was preferred to labster blue although the difference was small in magnitude it was statistically significant finally i just wanted to give you a heads up that im switching everyone over to labster maize beyond the fact that it was preferred it has also come to my attention that there is a bug in labster blue that prevents the execution of member functions from being displayed this wont have mattered for anything earlier on but now that were working with classes i think it would be best to migrate to maize im sorry if blue has caused any confusion for you recently thanks james

instructor,hello all over the weekend you all had the opportunity to look over your midterm exams on gradescope you are now able to submit regrade requests through gradescope for questions you believe were graded incorrectly in order to submit a regrade find the specified subquestion and select request regrade in the bottom right hand corner you will then be prompted to enter an explanation for the regrade in this text field you should include which part of your question was incorrectly graded 1 sentence why you believe your answer is correct 13 sentences depending on question type as you can see the second part is quite subjective however the more detail you give the better we can investigate your regrade please give enough information in your regrade request or we will not acknowledge it for example if you are requesting a regrade for question 4a the tree question and your defense is this will work we have less information for what the issue is and are less likely to fix the issue if you write although im not initially checking the base case i do have treeisemptytree checks prior to any other functionality not causing any possible segmentation faults we will have a better indication on where to start to fix your grade if you leave this field empty your regrade request will be discarded note that while regrading your exam the course staff will check through the rest of your exam as well because of this we may catch other errors we made while grading and your exam score could decrease if you have any questions please email me kmcateeumichedu thanks kris pin
instructor,if you were planning to meet with me during oh tonight please let me know and i will try to find an alternative time thanks
instructor,makefiles are convenient way to organize code compilation it allows you to refer to very large complicated build processes with very simple and short code calls to exemplify were going to consider the canonical hello world program maincpp include iostream int main stdcout hello world stdendl to compile this program you would run here denotes terminal commands g maincpp o main now this seems rather easy theres not a whole lot of trouble retyping this each time you need to rebuild the program just to make things more interesting lets consider the eecs 280 case where we require a whole ton of flags to make sure that any potential errors are caught earlier g pedantic wall werror o1 maincpp o main this would definitely be awful to have to type every time we wanted to make rebuild the program thats where makefile s come in makefiles allow us to create a sortof function call that would run these command line compilations for us were going to define a function called build so that when we wish to build our program its only a simple bash command like make build youll notice that make wants to know which build command to run so you need to specify it as the first command line argument namely make buildfunction so now we need to actually implement this function makefiles are conveniently always named makefile so we create our makefile file called makefile really fun to say outloud and we can add build commands with the following syntax note here that represent an abstraction and theyre actually not needed commandname dependencies bashcommand0 bashcommandn commandname the name of the command you want to build dependencies a space separated list of dependent header files bashcommand a list of all the terminal commands you want run when commandname is run for our hello world example we dont have any header files so we may omit the dependencies we specified our commandname as build and also described our bash commands earlier this allows us to write our makefile as so please note that are considered comment lines in makefiles makefile build g pedantic wall werror o1 maincpp o main now we can very easily build our project by running make build more coming soon however this is enough to open our makefile and use it pin
instructor,just wanted a bit of a dont panic post on piazza if youre getting status error the autograder has received your submission files and will be able to grade them later it just is under a large load and cannot grade right now sorry for the inconvenience of potentially not seeing the results of your last submissions the autograder right now the autograder later pin

instructor,hi class the project spec gives you several different messages to send to cerr when something goes wrong with input in your program and that you should also call exit1 or otherwise return a nonzero value from main if this happens there is some confusion on when precisely to use which message eg unrecognized mode vs error reading mode unfortunately the spec is not 100 clear on this we apologize its our bad on the autograder we will only be checking that you exited with nonzero status but we will not check the message that was sent to cerr pin

instructor,the final task in project 2 is to implement function inserttree please note that a sorted binary tree does allow for duplication of elements the specification of a wellformed binary tree requires that the elements in the left subtree is strictly less than the root while the elements in the right subtree must be greater than or equal to the root therefore is a wellformed sorted binary tree but is not sorry to those who i told that you didnt need to deal with duplication of elements in this function

instructor,the original version of my lecture 4 slide 15 claimed in a footnote that ironically both orderings of the update equations happened to work out because the work left out by the incorrect ordering was just redundant work however i later realized that there would also be an issue when the end of the list was reached because the incorrect ordering causes an attempt to use listfirst on an empty list i have corrected the slide accordingly

instructor,hello class starting this semester we have implemented what im calling primetime office hours you can stop by 1695 bbb any time from 2pm8pm monday thru friday for help during primetime office hours there will be two eecs 280 staffers present to answer questions note on tuesdays primetime office hours begin at 3pm instead of 2pm coordinating our office hours this way in a single location allows us to maximize the amount of help we can offer you in a class this large 750 students heres how 1 by having multiple staffers answering questions the helpqueue moves faster than when only a single staffer is answering questions this will help to decrease the huge waittimes weve seen in previous semesters 2 when one staffer leaves another one is arriving students who are still in the helpqueue when a staffer leaves can be assured that they will still receive help this is a vast improvement over the standard practice in most courses where those students would simply be out of luck when the gsi leaves 3 by having long continuous office hours instead of sporadically scheduled chunks of office hours you will be able to get more questions answered during one of your typical work sessions than was possible in previous semesters 4 since primetime office hours are situated in just a single location with easily remembered times there is zero guesswork involved when you realize you need help no need to check the schedule to see if someone has office hours that day or if those office hours conflict with your other classes if its between 2pm and 8pm just show up at 1695 we look forward to helping you cheers vidal and the staff

instructor,prof olsons mw1230p lectures in sph2 m1020 are a little bit different than the lectures being offered at other times these lectures are being whimsically called 280x but its really just 280 same labs projects and exams the 280x lectures are skipping over some of the material in the other lectures in order to create time to talk a bit more about how c and c work using comparisons to other languages and short arm assembly snippets to illustrate this the hypothesis of 280x is that this additional context will make it easier for new programmers to understand the trickier aspects of c while also providing exposure to material that should be interesting to students with previous programming experience since 280x lectures do not cover all of the material covered by other lectures including material that might be on the exam you should also watch 280 lectures online if you attend the 280x lectures if you were assigned to the 280x lecture you can of course switch to another lecture if its not for you similarly if youre in another lecture section and would like to try out 280x youre welcome to the slides and lecture recordings for 280x are available here httpauereecsumichedueecs280f15 pin

student,i passed every project 5 test case except for the rational arithmetic one rationaltest06 so i thought id start a thread to figure out whats wrong with my implementation and possibly those of other people who also failed the same test case one of the unconventional things that i did in implementing my rational arithmetic was to crossreduce the numbers during multiplication and to apply the least common multiple during addition in order to further mitigate possible intermediate overflows for instance if i were multiplying 215 and 157 i would first divide out the common factors between the numerator of one and denominator of the other in this case 7 for the numerator of the first and denominator of the second and 5 for the denominator of the first and numerator of the second and then do an equivalent multiplication with the redundant factors already removed in this case 31 31 if i were adding 34 and 56 i would bring each to the lowest common denominator 12 in this case so 912 1012 instead of just using the multiples of the denominators these changes dont make a difference for small numbers but if the test cases use large enough numbers with common factors my implementation might give a different answer than the common one for instance 230318 319230 1073741824387420489 11622614671073741824 is 3 on my implementation and 1 without crossreducing 3230 5230 31073741824 51073741824 is 1227 1134217728 on my implementation and undefined 00 otherwise i dont think it would make sense for the test cases to touch situations like this in order to make sure that our implementations overflow where theyre expected to overflow but if they did that might be the issue anyway heres what my rational class does for cases involving 00 10 10 0 1 and 1 it follows the general arithmetic formulas at least to my ability to check it which should be the right behavior according to earlier piazza discussions 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 10 00 00 10 00 00 10 00 00 10 00 00 10 00 00 10 00 00 10 00 00 10 00 00 0 00 00 0 00 00 0 00 00 0 00 00 1 00 00 1 00 00 1 00 00 1 00 00 1 00 00 1 00 00 1 00 00 1 00 10 00 00 10 00 00 10 00 00 10 00 00 10 10 00 10 10 00 10 10 10 10 10 00 10 10 00 10 10 00 10 10 10 10 10 00 10 0 10 10 0 10 10 0 00 10 0 10 10 1 10 10 1 10 10 1 10 10 1 10 10 1 10 10 1 10 10 1 10 10 1 10 10 00 00 10 00 00 10 00 00 10 00 00 10 10 00 10 10 00 10 10 10 10 10 00 10 10 00 10 10 00 10 10 10 10 10 00 10 0 10 10 0 10 10 0 00 10 0 10 10 1 10 10 1 10 10 1 10 10 1 10 10 1 10 10 1 10 10 1 10 10 1 10 0 00 00 0 00 00 0 00 00 0 00 00 0 10 10 0 10 10 0 10 00 0 10 0 0 10 10 0 10 10 0 10 00 0 10 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 00 0 1 1 0 1 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 1 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 00 00 1 00 00 1 00 00 1 00 00 1 10 10 1 10 10 1 10 10 1 10 0 1 10 10 1 10 10 1 10 10 1 10 0 1 0 1 1 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 10 1 1 2 1 1 0 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 0 1 1 2 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 00 00 1 00 00 1 00 00 1 00 00 1 10 10 1 10 10 1 10 10 1 10 0 1 10 10 1 10 10 1 10 10 1 10 0 1 0 1 1 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 10 1 1 0 1 1 2 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 2 1 1 0 1 1 1 1 1 1 i hope this proves to be helpful
student,when can we expect to get our exam grades and final class grades back
student,getting some very strange results when i submitted i had no diff errors with the test cases and did extremely thorough testing of list however i failed a lot of my test cases especially in list also there are some very contradictory tests i passed and failed ex how could i fail arithmetic in rational but pass it in calc also is there something strange going on when the average grade for p5 is lower than that of euchre
student,i just received my project five score and its extremely low even though i had multiple test cases and double checked many times im extremely worried because this is a big hit to my grade i got all of these simple functions wrong 02 calctest06 addition 02 calctest07 subtraction 02 calctest08 multiplication 02 calctest09 division 02 calctest10 duplicate 02 calctest11 reverse 02 calctest12 match even though i checked all of these multiple times before submitting was there any issue with the autograder
student,did anyone else have issues with their listtest grading for some reason we failed even the simplest ones like emptiness
student,what was the average score of project 5
student,thats baller
student,was that real life
student,for part b would the base class custom constructors run or is it only default constructors that run up until you hit your type at which what ever constructor is needed runs because a majority of the answers on the google responses said that the magicalbeing wizard and slytherin custom constructors would runbut i wasnt sure if that included custom ctors
student,i am a little stuck on one thing that i think may help clear up my understanding of dynamic memory if you initialize a local array i understand that it is really just a pointer to the first element of the array but are the individual elements stored on the heap for example is this correct int i2 23 this is stored in memory as beginning of stack int i end of stack beginning of heap 3 int 2 int this is what i points to int i2 i0 2 i1 3 this is stored in memory as beginning of stack int i end of stack beginning of heap 3 int 2 int int pts to 3 int pts to 2
student,yeah im just interested in sharing answers to compare and contrast and learn could anyone help me out
student,how lenient were these graded a lot of the choices seem to be a little vague and i some of the questions i couldnt decide whether to use 1 or 2 of the answers for for example the second question associate many behaviors with one function statically this is the definition of polymorphism but virtual functions are used to implement it would both be included in the answer and for used to implement a downcast would the answer be dynamiccast and dynamic type or just dynamiccast
student,when drawing the stack frame does the pointer only point to the little void when p0 is called after delete p
student,hi im just relooking over the practice exam and i noticed that the resizeandcopyconst stackt s declaration has the input argument s declared as const when i was at the review session they simply placed this into the function to use the function for the constructor wouldnt that be violating the const part of this then because technically youre changing the current this even though the this is passed in as an argument can anyone explain this provide any insight as to why this is ok
student,is the right order of this question be constructor 1 constructor 2 copy constructor 1 assignment 12 copy constructor 2 i got ten points destructor 1 destructor 2 i am missing one destructor 1 and one destructor 2 could anyone tell me when and where should i put them thanks
student,what is the output i get caught slytherin draco but the answers are mixed on the online submission form
student,when do we assign pointers to zero or null after deleting the object it points to and when dont we have to
student,i saw this function in one of the lab why dont we have to delete the array here void arrayintvectorpopback checkinvariants assertempty numelements checkinvariants
student,can someone please explain all the destructors in this problem i get everything else except why there are 3 destructor for 1 and where they are called
student,is this right this was so confusing
student,what is order constructor copy assignment run for these two lines bigthree othervar1 othervar2 thanks
student,hi im just making sure when you utilize the dynamiccast lets say to cast steve to a ceo just as in problem 2a of the spring 2013 midterm would that create an version of steve that would then call the constructor destructor the full code is as follows employee e steve no constructor runs because its just creating a pointer to steve ifceo c dynamiccastceoe cout cgreet endl my followup question is whether there would be a difference if we did this ceo c dynamiccastceosteve in this case were dealing with the actual objects instead of pointers so id assume that at this point a constructor and destructor would definitely run thoughts thanks for any insight
student,say we have the triangle adt from lecture with derived class isosceles if we do isosceles i new isosceles2 3 do we still run the triangle default constructor we should run it right
student,what if we make the code dracowhatami into myarray1whatami what is the output of myarray1whatami thanks
student,can anyone tell me if this is right
student,can derived class be abstract class
student,for example in problem 2 of spring 13 when we try to downcast employees to ceos what happens i know that say if you try to downcast horses from a horse stored in an animal array you would succeed but what about this
student,the question asks to circle deleted memory blocks when delete p is called wouldnt this cause the dlist destructor to run if so should we just assume the destructor is implemented correctly and no memory is leaked
student,did we ever get answers to the midterm
student,are we allowed to use memcpy on the exam
student,if we do this rectangle r3 r2r2 has been initialized before if rectangle has a default constructor does copy constructor run or assignment operator run
student,if you attempt to throw while you are not in a try block will you get a compiler error
student,i was looking at lecture 17 and on slide 18 there is a function that returns a pointer but all that is returned is an int array i tried coding it up but i get a compiler error that says i am trying to return the address of a local variable is the code on the slide correct and does that mean that we can return an array as a pointer without using the symbol
student,using the triangle class hierarchy we used in lectures if you throw an error with type isosceles and then have a catch block that catches triangles followed by one that catches isosceles will the exception be caught twice or just the first time because isosceles is derived from triangle and then it will skip the rest
student,help help say if we have a base class a whose destructor is virtual and we have another class b which is derived from a and class c derived from b if we have b b new b c c new c but we forget to delete these instances then here are the questions the number of memory leaks associated with instances of the a class wasthe number of memory leaks associated with instances of the b class wasthe number of memory leaks associated with instances of the c class was
student,can someone critique my interpretation of what happens on the stack and heap
student,when the delete function is called on a class does it call the classes constructor like if the destructor has a command to kill all the dynamic memory used by the class or does delete just simply delete the class without using the destructor
student,would a derived class function have to be declared virtual in order to use the function example if there is a base class function virtual void insertint n could the derived class function be the following and still run properly void insertdouble n or would it have to be virtual void insertdouble n
student,it says that you can use resizeandcopy in 5 of the 6 functions i used it in 4 of the 6 the only two that are left are the destructor and the constructor my guess was that you can use it in the constructor but wasnt really sure about thathow please help
student,1 so when a function is declared virtual in the base class and it is redefinied in another class polymorphism will always find the correct function implementation to call for example class a virtual foo do something class b public a foo do something else class c public b foo do something different an instance of c will always call the class cs implementation of the foo function i couldve sworn it only went down one level or am i thinking of destructors 2 this is derived from sp13 final problem 1b are the following actually valid statements that can be run and if so could someone give an example of it delete a delete a delete a 3 for the last question on the fall 13 final how can you say that the new function bebad wont change any behaviors of the class that isnt consistant with the supertype shouldnt the answer to this question be cant be determined i know youre allowed to add functions but how do you know how its being implemented in the class
student,when the main ends the destructors for the three bigthree variable will be run in what order will their destructors be run i know the output should be destructor 1 destructor 2 destructor 1 but does the other variable get destructed first or is it var1
student,on this problem the answer is no this is because it will call exit1 terminating the program would the appropriate thing to do in this situation is to remove that code and return this also the cout statement is different than that of the employees but that doesnt violate the liskov substitution principle in any way does it
student,generally when im unsure i tend to go the safest route even if its horribly slow for example in 3c fall exam in the iterator loop the way i implemented it is that it checks every iterator with the findif function even though i know the findif function skips to the first element that meets the criteria im just 100 sure my first implementation will work while maybe 95 sure the quicker and more effective implemention i have in mind will work of course ill choose the 100 way on an exam im wondering how if it will matter when the grader looks at the problem
student,private vs public
student,now you can ctrlf for anything in all of the lecture slides for the whole semester combined into one 8 mb pdf file
student,after checking the submitted answers on the google doc all the responses stated that the output was i am a magical being i am slytherin scum i dont think this is correct since array0 is a pointer to an elf why are students getting the first line of output i think the output should be i am an elf i am slytherin scum the function call to whatami is not virtual so shouldnt the elf class call its function any help is appreciated
student,do we need to include an rme for functions we write on the exam
student,fill in this google form with your responses to the spring exam httpsdocsgooglecomformsd1rqks0iichfowilczd9lvwfbdwibhdanji6hi5yuisviewform
student,would this be a validto run if not a null ptr int a 2 intb a ifb
student,when declaring ceo stevestevej there is no constructor in the base class employee that only takes one string argument so does it automatically go to the ceo class and call that constructor i know the usual hierarchy is that it first calls the constructor for the base class and then the derived class but is that only if there is an applicable one in the base class
student,int main vector v1 vpushbacknew int2 vpushbacknew int3 vector uv delete vpopback are we just deleted that individual data that we created with new int3 so then we would need three more to deal with the last one in v and the two within u
student,many versions of questions about destructors have come up and i was hoping to clear some things up it would be great if an instructor could supply their input in the slides there was a definition of destructors and when they run they run automatically for statically allocated objects when the object goes out of scope they run for dynamically allocated objects when it is deleted with delete when i spoke with an instructor at the review they said destructors run when delete is explicitly called on an object by the programmer there was a previous post where someone implement a cout statement in the destructor to check this and it didnt run is it possible to get an overview of when the destructors run does delete actually call the destructor thank you
student,ctors should never be virtual right
student,i am trying to complete the vector section of lab 11 and i was hoping someone could help me with the postfix and prefix overloads first of all i am not sure how to increment since we dont have a node with a next pointer secondly does the prefix still return this thanks for any help
student,im having trouble making the predicate functor this is what i have so far i think i need a constructor in here somewhere possibly but am not sure exactly what to do and what private member variables this functor needs if any if someone could point me in the right direction it would be much appreciated class greeneggs public bool operator const struct input if inputbreed araucana inputbreed ameraucana return true return false also how do you use the enums my thought was replace the araucana and ameraucana in the if statement with their respective numbers 0 and 1 possibly
student,will the destructor run when we use delete void intsetgrow cout using grow endl int tmp new inteltscapacity 1 for int i 0 i eltssize i tmpi eltsi cout delete endl delete elts cout delete endl elts tmp eltscapacity 1 intsetintset delete elts cout dtor runs endl say if grow is called somewhere in the program will the destructor run
student,i cant seem to figure out what they want for the very last question functors are different from function pointers because they are could anyone help steer me to the right answer i know that functors act almost like first class objects but i cant figure out what words they want from the answer bank thanks
student,are dracos destructors the only ones that run because everything else was created with new
student,i am confused what exactly happens when i try throw draco how am i suppose to know what error is thrown
student,just want to make sure that the subtype cannot return a value that is not allowed by supertype also considering this condition base class has copy constructor but derived class does not have one does this make derived class not a subtype or the copy constructor is inherited
student,this probably wont matter for the test but why dont you have to declare the template type when using a templated operator like
student,how do you perform a safe downcast per question 5f in fall 2013 im still a little fuzzy on downcasting
student,im a little confused on when custom constructors run lets say i have a triangle and isosceles class triangle default ctor triangleint a int b int c custom ctor isosceles default isoscelesint a int b triangleint a int b int b and in my main code i have isosceles a12 will the order be triangle default constructor isosceles custom triangle custom i believe in lecture deorio said that if you call the triangle function from an initilizer list like isoscelesint a int b triangleabb the order will be triangle custom isosceles custom but im not exactly sure if you call the triangle customer from the code block
student,in the copy constructor after you have newdatai datai is newdatai now the same int pointer as datai same memory address a new int pointer that points to the same address where an integer is held as datai a new int pointer that points to a new address with the same integer that datai points to something else that im entirely missing
student,does returning this from an overloaded assignment operator function produce a call to the copy constructor
student,just wondering if anyone would be interested to meet tomorrow sunday for a brief period mid afternoonevening to comparediscuss practice exam solutions all of my friends dropped the class during project 3 and scouring piazza is no fun i live near central but would be willing to meet on north let me know umich email stephds
student,i was looking over lectures and i was wondering under what circumstances would using protected member variables be better than declaring a derived class to be a friend class and vice versa thanks

student,for this question does the function first run slytherin constructor and then in its constructor it called wizard constructor and wizard called magicalbeing i got six lines of output which i believe make sense is it correct thanks a lot if someone could help magicalbeing ctordraco wizard ctordraco slytherin ctor draco slytherin dor draco wizard dotr draco magiaclbeing dotrdraco
student,hey does anyone remember if we were required to turn in our cheat sheet with our last exam i cant find the one i made but i never picked up my last exam so that could be why thanks
student,when drawing the stack and heap diagram do we have to include the member variables or no which one would you say is more correct this is 3d of the spring exam img0841jpg
student,say you have a class triangle and a class isosceles with isosceles derived from triangle and they both have non virtual destructors if you declare a local isosceles variable will both destructorsthe triangle and isosceles run when the object goes out of scope
student,im kind of confused on how to do this question without having a prev pointer what i was wondering is if every next node pointer has its own next node pointer for example the way i thought of maybe writing the removeback function is to create a new node called something like check that gets set equal to first and then do a while loop that states whilechecknext last checknext checknextnext im not sure if we can do this though the idea behind it is my new node will eventually be equal to the node in the list right before last so i can set last check effectively taking out the back node after i delete both check and victim the node ill have set equal to last in order to return the last element if this doesnt work it would be helpful to see a correct implementation thanks in advance for a reply
student,is it possible for there to be more than one answer on any of the vocabulary questions other than the very first one
student,can anyone tell me the answer and give some explanation
student,when drawing the class hierarchy does the way in which the arrows point matter so for example class public class second class public so for this would it matter if the arrow is pointing up from second to public of should it be pointing down from public to class or does it matter
student,can the cheat sheet be a blank white printer paper or does it have to be lined maybe a stupid question but i just want to make sure im not breaking any rules
student,say i do int ptr new int2 int newptr ptr delete ptr ptr null cout newptr endl one of these lines is crashing my code but im not sure which one probably because im not sure if im using delete and null correctly would anyone mind to help
student,i dont understand what the question ask me to do can anybody show me how to solve this problem thanks
student,i was wondering if the default argument constructor worked for all classes or if there was a specific usage
student,what do we need to know about factory functions if anything
student,the second to last line in main is linsertback new int2 there is no variable l declared in main is is supposed to be p and has anyone attempted this problem and want to share their answer we saw stackheap diagrams and linked list diagrams in lecture but never in one problem so im not sure how this is supposed to look
student,in the syllabus it states that final grades will be assigned based on the distribution of earned scores consistent with past incarnations of eecs 280 in the past the median student has received a grade in the low b range how is it that the grades are assigned relative to the median what grades might the students who achieve the median score receive in years past how much above the median does the a range begin
student,the question asks which iterators if any are invalidated by a call to erasei on the doublylinked list im not sure i understand what this question is asking does it just mean the iterator that was pointing to the item that was erased
student,does the ceo type adhere to the liskov substitution principle if not rewrite any necessary methods to make it substitutable according to liskov what was the correct answer to this a quick explanation as to why would be helpful too thanks
student,i just wonder if we can use specific int double values for the catch condition try if throw 7 if throw 70 catch7 cout error 7 catch70 cout error 70 will the code work
student,let say i had the code class a public virtual getname const class bpublic a int main a aptr new a ifb bptr dynamiccastbaptr cout bgetname how come this dynamiccast doesnt work isnt b an a int main b binstance a ptr binstance ifb bptr dynamiccastbaptr cout bgetname does this above code work
student,im unsure about how to check if it follows liskovs substitution principal or not i think that it does for football but not for ball is that correct my reasoning for why it doesnt follow the principal for ball is that ball has a virtual function bounces that is not in nerfvortex
student,i am confused about how virtual applies to ctor dtor and member functions are these true with virtual virtual constructor makes derived class run its own ctor and therefore only one ctorderived classs run virtual destructor makes both destructor run when the class is linked to a pointer virtual member functions makes derived class run its own member functions if these are true consider this code triangle t new isoceles i assuming ctor is declared virtual and isoceles ctor does not reuse triangles ctor will triangles ctor run
student,hi so im a little curious about how passing classes by value works and how to know which constructor will run i understand that the copy constructor runs if it is defined but what about in cases such as where a copy constructor is not created then does a normal constructor run or an alternative one if a normal one does not exist or does is there a default copy constructor that always runs
student,when you throw a derived class slytherin and if there is a catch for a parent class wizard the derived class object will always be caught by the parent class catcher is that right in the same vein if magicalbeing tries to catch a slytherin object it will succeed as well right
student,i was testing the harry potter code specifically this segment myarray0whatami dracowhatami and i get i am a magical being i am a slytherin scum but when i tweaked the code a little to myarray0whatami myarray1whatami i get i am a magical being i am a magical being can someone explain why is this is it because myarray is an array of magicalbeing pointers which results in the magicalbeing version of whatami being called
student,i accidentally saved over a word file that i was working on i remember prof deorio mentioning the usage of a terminal command something along the lines of cat devsda grcp stardata he went through it pretty quickly so i wasnt able to get it all down can anyone explain this to me and give me the correct command or if you know of another way to do it that would be really awesome thanks
student,after program finishes does dynamically allocated memory automatically get deleted if there are virtual destructors or do we only call the destructor by having the lines of delete
student,is it because functor can change as run time
student,can someone help me with the answer to associate many behaviors with one function dynamically the options are with the most improbable ones removes dynamic type upcast downcast staticcast dynamiccast container class
student,i was just confused by the double pointers and was wondering what happens when the copy constructor runs i made another int pointing to the existing elements essentially just copying the pointer array but wasnt sure if that was right do we have to actually copy the elements as well and have the new int point to those this is roughly what i have i apologize for the poorly drawn diagram
student,for the main function in this problem i put some cout break statements to help split it up int main bigthree var11 cout break endl bigthree var22 cout break endl bigthree other var2 cout break endl other var1 cout break endl testvar1 var2 my output when i put this in my computer to see the correct result was constructor 1 break constructor 2 break copy constructor2 break assignment operator 12 copy constructor2 destructor 2 break copy constructor1 i got my 10 points destructor 1 destructor 2 destructor 2 destructor 1 my question is why is the destructor running in the other var1 call im passing by reference so it shouldnt be creating a new object also why are the destructors called 4 times
student,if the whole idea is that you can replace a supertype with a subtype then wouldnt a weaker precondition for the subtype mean that it has behavior that the supertype isnt defined for or is the idea that the subtype can do everything the supertypr can do still but now can do more or accept a woder range of input
student,in the practice exam one of the codes uses a distributed list did we go over this which lecture
student,what happen to the big three problem b the parameters in the functionp
student,in the intset class for overloading the assignment operator the function declaration is intset operator const intset rhs could someone explain why it is necessary to return a reference to an intset rather than just an intset itself thanks in advance
student,when exactly would we use dynamic variables versus local variables i didnt fully understand this from lectures and it seems that dynamic variables only create potential for memory leaks and we might as well just use local variables
student,as i was going through the lecture on interfaces and invariants i ran into a slide which mentioned that you cannot declare an instance of an abstract interfaceonly class with pure virtual functions which i knew but then it goes on to say that you can declare a pointer and a reference such as follows inset isptr i have no problems with this inset isref however when i try to code that section i receive a compiler error stating that the isref is declared as reference but not initialized my question is that without being able to declare an instance of this how could we possible have an object or address to initialize this to thanks for any insight
student,hi i was hoping someone might know the answer to this question ive been going through the lecture slides and codingup all of the examples for polymorphism and i ran into this strange bug if i have an inherited class isosceles such as class isosceles public triangle isosceles why does the following code lead to an array of errors isosceles myisoscelestriangle rather to declare an isosceles triangle the must be omitted obviously this is strange syntax but i wouldve assumed that it wouldve worked just the same is it because that line would create another anonymous isosceles triangle thanks for any insight
student,could our cheat sheet be laser printed or it have to be handwritten thanks
student,where do we submit the evaluations for credit has the deadline passed
student,void testbigthree a bigthree b couti got my 10 points endl does the copy constructor run in for bigthree a in the same way it runs in the class example for foois ie because it is not passed as reference as bigthree b is we dont want dynamic memory to be deleted when is it passed as a parameter thanks
student,liskov subsitution principle states if s is a subtype of t then obejects of type t may be replaced with s in sring 2013 exam problem 2 b should we create a copy constructor for ceo are all constructors not inherited thank you
student,i just realized that i had forgotten to put my name at the top of my files when i submitted them how is this going to impact my score if it matters im worked on the project alone
student,will there be another submit doc for the practice exam answers i thought the one for the midterm was really helpful to confirm answers
student,so the final exam is cumulative but will focus more on topics covered after the midterm is this correct
student,will we be allowed a cheat sheet for the final like on the midterm
student,my partner and i had different style and i put no on the top of my calccpp but my partner forgot it says if you dont put anything theyll assume the style is the same is there a chance ours could be graded the same because he forgot or no because i put no is there anyone i should contact about this our code is really different
student,if it is possible could the exam be printed in a way so that we do not have to flip back and forth between pages to answer a question i find my self loosing a lot of time flipping back and forth while taking practice exams especially with what is the output questions where the code if on the back side of the page
student,so here is my stack printing function stdostream operatorstdostream os const stacku obj for typename listuiterator i objlistbegin i objlistend i if objisempty return os else cout i im getting an access violation reading location and using breakpoints it appears that my iterator is going one past where i need it to any ideas i checked my listend to make sure it was just going one past the end and thats all good i cant seem to figure it out

student,so in calccpp when writing the main im doing if statements checking for the commands after i read input in as a string they say things like reverse requires a stack with at least two operands do we need to assert to check for things like that or are we assuming youre giving input that wont try to do this sort of thing thanks
student,my partner and i are having trouble submitting our code our code passes the given test cases and compile on vnc however when we try to submit it says our code does not compile and we will likely not receive many points any help
student,when running valgrind i have memory possibly lost for the exact same commands when i use ctrl c to quit but no memory leaks when i use q to quit any ideas why this is what i get when i use ctrl c to quit 5 d m d m d m a c 2 1 1 5 c28141 28141 heap summary 28141 in use at exit 26 bytes in 1 blocks 28141 total heap usage 11 allocs 10 frees 266 bytes allocated 28141 28141 26 bytes in 1 blocks are possibly lost in loss record 1 of 1 28141 at 0x4a075bc operator newunsigned long vgreplacemallocc298 28141 by 0x374fe9c3c8 stdstringrepscreateunsigned long unsigned long stdallocatorchar const in usrlib64libstdcso6013 28141 by 0x374fe9d19a stdstringrepmclonestdallocatorchar const unsigned long in usrlib64libstdcso6013 28141 by 0x374fe9d5eb stdstringreserveunsigned long in usrlib64libstdcso6013 28141 by 0x374fe7b05a stdbasicistreamchar stdchartraitschar stdoperatorchar stdchartraitschar stdallocatorchar stdbasicistreamchar stdchartraitschar stdbasicstringchar stdchartraitschar stdallocatorchar in usrlib64libstdcso6013 28141 by 0x400fdf main in afsumicheduuserrsrshconneecs280proj5calc 28141 28141 leak summary 28141 definitely lost 0 bytes in 0 blocks 28141 indirectly lost 0 bytes in 0 blocks 28141 possibly lost 26 bytes in 1 blocks 28141 still reachable 0 bytes in 0 blocks 28141 suppressed 0 bytes in 0 blocks 28141 28141 this is what i get when i use q to quit 5 d m d m d m a c 2 1 1 5 q 28611 28611 heap summary 28611 in use at exit 0 bytes in 0 blocks 28611 total heap usage 11 allocs 11 frees 266 bytes allocated 28611 28611 all heap blocks were freed no leaks are possible i return 0 when q is inputted instead of exit0 thanks
student,such as this requires a stack with at least two operands
student,if my calccpp uses a string for user input must i include string the program works without adding it but im scared that im just getting lucky
student,can we use stoi on this project we didnt need to include anything extra and our project compiles and works on xcode but when we try to submit it it tells us the files wont compile because stoi was not declared in this scope
student,we are trying to create an overloaded assignment operator and a copy constructor for rational but this compiler error keeps showing up to my knowledge you have to declare the presence of the copy constructor and operator first in the class definition which is in the header to overload things properly but what do we do since we cant modify rationalh our function declarations are rationalrationalconst rationalrational r rational rationaloperator const rational r
student,im confused on what were supposed to do in m the example in the spec is confusing since it does something that isnt described it says that the stack 2 2 3 2 4 2 m should result in 3 4 2 3 2 2 which is the inputted stack but in reverse with the number of 2s added onto the front the spec says all we need to do is pop off the last element and push on the number of times it appears in the rest of the stack but it doesnt say anything about reversing the stack are we supposed to reverse the stack after we push the number of times the popped off rational occurs
student,everything in my calculator is working except when i try to divide by zero which gives me a floating point exception and then crashes my program any idea why this is it should create a rational number with the same numerator as the other number and zero for a denominator
student,when i run valgrind on my code at the end i get something like this for counts of detected and suppressed errors rerun with v 2055 error summary 0 errors from 0 contexts suppressed 6 from 6 do i need to look for suppressed errors if so how do i go about finding them
student,this is just a quick semantic question why can the list functions specifically insert and erase access the private member variables in the iterator class i know the iterator class defines list to be a friend but i thought that meant that the iterator class can access all of lists variables but not the other way around is this so because the iterator class was defined inside of the list class
student,within listh to check if an interator i is equal to the first node of a list would it be better to use ifi first or ifinodeptr first
student,consider this case listint empty listintiterator emptybegin emptybegin listintiterator emptyend emptyend emptyinsertemptybegin 12 emptyinsertemptyend 13 emptyinsertemptyend 14 emptyinsertemptyend 15 emptyinsertemptybegin 16 cout empty endl the result is the list 12 13 14 15 16 this means that emptybegin doesnt point to the beginning of the list after adding values is this something we need to worry about in our list implementation
student,i am submitting listh stackh rationalcpp and calccpp to the autograder but it says the submission will not compile and that i am likely to receive very few points the code itself compiles fine on the server when i run g wall werror pedantic o1 calccpp rationalcpp o calc should i ignore the warning and turn it in anyway im very confused as to why this warning appears since the code compiles does it not compile because rationalh is not included i didnt make any changes to that file so it doesnt make sense for me to submit it
student,when we create a functor for calccpp would we loose point is we dont have it within an anonymous namespace namespace class n
student,for the require clause of erase or insert requires i is a valid iterator associated with this list and points to an element ie it is not at end could we simply just void eraseiterator i asserti 0
student,where would we put a friend declaration in stackh i know we arent supposed to modify stackhs public interface but in the private interface the comment reads you must make use of lists public interface to implement the stack you must not make changes to the private section so does that mean we cant change the private section of stackh and what about the private section of listh
student,do i need to worry about the still reachable memory leak
student,my operator for my stack class is acting up it cant find the and i believe it has something to do with templating mixed with declaring it as a friend i can upload the error and relevant code but i dont know what the rules are on this
student,for my calccpp i created a functor outside of main is this allowed and if so should the functor class be static
student,i passed the published test cases with make test but when i submitted to submit280 there is a warning saying calc test 1 failed and when i looked at the email i received my output to calctest01 is missing the last line i have double checked the output of calctest01in and it is correct why is submit280 output missing a line of output
student,is there any code other than the includes for stack list and rational that are necessary to include in calccpp my compiler keeps saying that stack s is not declared in the scope but rational functions are thoughts right now i have include iostream include cassert include iostream include cstddef include listh include rationalh include stackh using namespace std thanks
student,should we assume inputs will be integers or could they be very large numbers requiring a long long
student,can we delete some of the instructional comments that were put into some of our files like listh these comments make it look like my file is cluttered but i want to make sure i wont lose style points by deleting them
student,i know that valgrind doesnt like exit0 but i also saw in a previous piazza post that we wouldnt lose points for using exit0 so my question is in our final submit should we use return 0 or exit0 regarless of what valgrind thinks thanks
student,so i found an interesting bug in my code when i was using iterators to test insert and erase i called insertfront numerous times to fill in an empty list i had already created an iterator i that pointed to the beginning of the list this is the list after calling insertfront 0 1 2 3 where 0 is the topmost element since i didnt alter iterator i yet it was still pointing to what it thought was the beginning which is now the 3s position then i did some more testing on the erase and insert function testing the boundary cases etc i did not change the iterators position in the beginning of this testing i had no segfaults and no compiling problems it worked perfectly and outputting perfectly i outputted the list after each inserterase when i used valgrind to check how my memory was doing it was telling me i had 7 allocations and only 2 freed which doesnt make sense because in total i had 9 allocations called insert five times insertfront four times and erase twice valgrind was telling me my problem was with my insertfront function but it doesnt tell me if it is when i call it in the test case or when insert calls it in special cases however i randomly decided to set the iterator to the beginning of the list after calling insertfront but before doing the indepth testing on erase and insert and then it worked i had 9 allocations and 9 freed any ideas why it wont work when i dont touch the iterator
student,when attempting to compile stackh i get this error among others listh in member function ‘void listtinsertbackconst t with t int’ stackh58 instantiated from ‘void stacktpushconst t with t int’ usrlibgccx8664redhatlinux447includec447cassert53 instantiated from here listh43 error invalid conversion from ‘const int’ to ‘int’ the thing is listh43 is an empty line whats more when i change listh to say add a line of whitespace its still spitting out listh43 why is it doing this
student,can we use cmath in rationalcpp
student,can somebody show me how can an iterator for insert be invalid i know that for erase if an iterators member variable is a null pointer its invalid but in insert if the pointer inside iterator is null we can insert at the end of the list so in order to satisfy the require clause i would like to find a way to use assert to identify an invalid iterator in this case what would such an iterator be or how do i use assert in this case
student,my stack wont print and i received this error undefined reference to stdbasicostreamchar stdchartraitschar operator intstdbasicostreamchar stdchartraitschar stackint const my code for os templatetypename t typename u function inputs fortypename listtiterator i objlistbegin i objlistend i os i return os
student,i tried declaring the function used to output a stack as a friend function of stack as in i added the line friend stdostream operatorstdostream os const stackt obj to my code but when i try to compile i get this error stackh97 note thats the line i added earlier to stack error friend declaration ‘stdostream operatorstdostream const stackt’ declares a nontemplate function stackh97 note if this is not what you intended make sure the function template has already been declared and add after the function name here
student,this segment of code is given in the private section of iterator in listhstarter construct an iterator at a specific position iteratornode p are we allowed to modify it i want to turn it into a custom constructor
student,i am trying to add assert statements to my calccpp for the input cases such as checking to make sure there are at least two elements on the list before calling i am calling assertspop or something similar but it says that no operator matches these operands i also want to call assert in functions such as erase but when i try something like asserti begin another error occurs does anyone know what these means as i am not using and how to go about adding the assert statements so that they dont cause these kind of errors thanks
student,just to clarify we dont need to be able to compare stacks right if we have two stacks a and b we dont need to worry about checking a b
student,are we responsible for memory leaks if an assert statement throws when the requires clause contract is not met we are currently leaking memory found by valgrind when our assert statement fires and unsure how to manage this memory thanks
student,my calculator works perfectly except that it fails to add zero to the stack if it is entered in the form 00 or with any other number of multiple zeroes is it a reasonable assumption that zero will always be entered as 0 is this something i should bother correcting

student,i looked through the lectures and i figured out how to implement countif using predicate in stackh but i am getting this compile error when i call it in calccpp in file included from calccpp9 stackh in member function ‘int stacktcountifpredicate const with predicate bool t rational’ calccpp81 instantiated from here stackh87 error ‘pred’ cannot be used as a function as far as i know i can put something like a and b is a variable of rational class stack is a stack variable stackcountifa b
student,if i input into calc 0 327 a then my output be 0 or should it be undefined because i will be putting 0 on the stack first then 327 pop 327 of first and then 0 divide zero by 327 and zero divided by anything is undefined or zero i thought that if rational number 01 is our representation of zero then should this be zero too
student,i am getting this error bash41 g wall werror pedantic o1 calccpp rationalcpp o calc in file included from calccpp9 listh in member function ‘const t stackttop const with t rational’ calccpp57 instantiated from here listh176 error ‘t listtiteratoroperator const with t rational’ is private stackh61 error within this context when i compile all the files as far as i can tell the dereference operator overload is in the public section of list so i do not understand why the compiler is telling me it is private within this context when i call return listbegin in my const t top function in stackh
student,last next np seg fault this is a part of insertback it makes sure that the second to last nodes next pointer is pointing to the last element this works fine in msvc 2012 in the testcase i am running this line only executes onceinsertback is called twice there is special code to handle an empty list here are the variables states when the seg fault happens last prev and last next are supposed to be pointing to null because it was the only node i am lost as far as i can tell this is not attempting to accessing data at null so why the seg fault
student,im not sure why i keep getting this error apparently its because of a type mismatch due to a const bool being returned bool listtisemptyvoid cannot convert this pointer from const listt to listt the function is just returning listisempty so im not sure where it is going wrong
student,if i remember correctly professor deorio mentioned this in lecture but i want to double check is it alright to have a memory leak with exit0 when i replace it with return 0 the leak is gone do i need to use exit0 in my code or can i use return 0
student,i didnt edit the test section of stacktest00cpp and im passing that just fine but when i tried submit280 i failed the stack test case this is the error i get void test assertion scountifcheck 2 failed is anyone else having this problem note i submitted an empty calccpp because mine isnt working completely yet but that shouldnt affect how stack works at all im working from my laptop but i am sshed in using putty
student,i have all the other files coded and the logic coded for stackh but i am having difficulty figuring out what object to use within stackh since we are not allowed to add private member variables to my understanding the type for stack adt is supposed to be list type and therefore it makes sense to use list member functions but i do not know what the object i should use is when i say object i mean obj isempty in other words i understand that i have to call isempty from list in the isempty function in stack but what is the object that i call isempty from list on thanks
student,i am attempting to use my insertfrontconst t datum function from class list in stackh to implement pushconst t item it is telling me that class listint has no member named insertfront syntax listinsertfrontitem what is wrong with my scope that would give me this error
student,i am getting a compiler error in my stackh file stating that i have an invalid use of incomplete type class stacku at the line where i define countif which is defined like this template typename predicate template typename t int stacktcountifpredicate pred const do stuff it follows up the error with error declaration of class stacku at the line where i begin the class which only uses t as a template variable i have no idea how this could possibly be happening
student,i have an issue with atoi for my calc function heres a slightly modified version of my code that shows the issue assume that the proper headers are present char input whileinput q cin input if atoiinput 0 or input 0 checks for either an interger or zero due to the fact that atoinonint returns 0 cout atoiinput endl lets say that i input three numbers 5 12 and 19 i would get this as my output 5 1 2 1 9 im not sure why this is happening
student,i tried to use valgrind in linux to check if theres any memory leak and got something like the following where did i do wrong thanks
student,do we have discussion tomorrow since there is no lab and all will the gsi be there
student,i know that this should have been asked earlier but i have no idea how to run calc you say in the project spec that you can do so by running calc but ive asked several people who have taken the class before and they are baffled in addition calc doesnt compile on mac i also dont know how to read input straight from the command line when using it in this way the aformentioned people who have taken the class before always suggest using cstdios functions then get confused as to getting it working when i tell them that were forbidden from cstdio this is an immense hurdle that i dont know how to surpass but i need to and soon
student,how can i make an iterator in testing right now i have iterator i lstbegin but it says that iterator was not declared in the scope i am including listh thanks
student,i am confused as to what the rme clause for inserti datum is saying and i probably am just confusing myself but it says it does not modify the element that the existing iterators including this iterator point to wouldnt this mean that the function cannot change what i points to but at the same time wouldnt i prev need to change to the new node again probably just confusing myself but some clarification on the effects clause would be very appreciated thank you
student,im struggling with this function when i try to call the predicate like predi i get an error saying called object type int is not a function or function pointer am i calling pred wrong thanks for any help
student,hello for some reason my countif function for the given test case should be running twice but is only running once anyone know why this could be
student,listint l fill l listint l2 l2 l listint l3 fill l3 after i erased elements from list l and tried to erase elements from list l2 it gives me seg fault i can still erase elements from l3 why does that happen which iterators will be invalidated by erase
student,where are office hours being held at today from 6 10pm
student,when i implemented my check for the iterators insert and erase functions i actually declared a separate function to do this knowing that we should declare helper functions as static i declared it so however i then ran into a problem where the code wont compile because the static function isnt visible as a friend of the list class so it doesnt have access to the first or last member variables this is easily fixed by simply removing the static declaration but im concerned that ill lose points because its not declared static any suggestions or would an instructor know if i would be deducted for doing this otherwise ill simply write the code twice but i dont want to be repetitive either
student,im getting the error stackh97 error nonmember function int countifpredicate cannot have cvqualifier stackh in function int countifpredicate stackh98 error there are no arguments to isempty that depend on a template parameter so a declaration of isempty must be available stackh98 note if you use fpermissive g will accept your code but allowing the use of an undeclared name is deprecated stackh101 error list was not declared in this scope i think the first one is the only problem since my function cant access isempty or list because the compiler doesnt register this as a member function it is declared within the stack class though i didnt change it
student,are we required to fill in rmes for all of the overloaded operators
student,do i need to have an iterator point to a node after i erase eg listint l2 l2insertfront3 l2insertfront2 l2insertfront1 listintiterator j l2begin cout l2 endl 1 2 3 l2erasej cout l2 endl 2 3 so should j point to 2 or 3 or neither
student,when i input the lines from calctest00in via copy and paste im working in xcode my code runs fine until it clears the stack the second time at which point it asks me for more input instead of cin 47 and continuing from there it works completely fine the first time it clears the stack but not the second time anyone know why this would happen
student,since the get functions are promising not to change the member variable then i assume any rational numbers they are given will already meet invariants when tested correct
student,in listh in functions insertfront and insertback my program gives me a segfault when i try to assign the old front or back pointers first or last pointer to the new node for example void listtinsertfrontconst t v node np new node code npnextprev np this is the line that gives me the segfault however i need to update the pointers on the old node return im confused as to why this gives me a segfault as i can edit other pointers no problem
student,for my m command i didnt use countif or any functors as the specs suggests we should use but my results are still correct is this a problem
student,it says dont edit
student,warning submission runs for over 10s with calc test case 1 you may have na infinite loop how is the testing done i thought we were supposed to simply cin command are we supposed to be streaming a file only way that our program would run into infinite loop is if the user does not input q
student,if we enter 4 6 should the final printed output be 23 or 23 as of now i am running it at 23 but thought it wise to ask anyway thank you
student,i am coding calculator right now and having trouble with the input the way that i am putting the number in is by converting cining a string and saving it to a string variable i tested this by putting in the test input line 25 17 6 32 p a c and went into the debugger to check that it was working and saw c only saved the 25 and has a ton of 0 following it does anyone know why this might be happening
student,0 0 a
student,for the command that prints the top element in the stack my code is only checking the assert statement in print if there is another operand after it for example 4 5 r c p q properly asserts that print should have at least one operand but 4 5 r c p does not do so i am not sure whether this is supposed to happen or whether there is a problem with my program does this have anything to do with my cineof i used that as one of two conditions in my while loop
student,i created a new test case for calccpp and one of the lines that i entered was 56 p 6 10 5 a c however the 56 prints as a 5 only im not sure if this is the proper value should we assume that it is legal to input rationalfractional values into the calculator or can we assume that they will all be entered as 5 6 p 6 10 5 a c instead
student,when going through my code to add comments i didnt think very many comments needed to be added because the functions are all pretty small and straightforward did you guys still include a decent amount of comments as compared to previous projects which had a lot more code and if so what exactly were you writing about
student,i have received these string of errors when trying to compile linktest00 listtest00cpp3 error expected nestednamespecifier before namespace listtest00cpp3 error expected unqualifiedid before namespace listtest00cpp3 error expected before namespace listtest00cpp3 error expected unqualifiedid before namespace listtest00cpp5 error declaration of class t any ideas
student,if i have iterator i can i use inext and iprev since i points to a node or will have have to use increment and decrement operators such as i i and create node pointers such as node down i i node up i i need these for insert and erase or just set node presentnode i and then use presentnodenext and presentnodeprev
student,is there a way to use an operator as a function argument i have some duplicate code in calccpp where the only difference is the add subtract divide or multiply operator have we learned a way to use function pointers functors to create a function for this code that takes in an operator as an argument and performs the operation
student,for my countif function i made an iterator listpiterator iobjlistbegin p being my template type however whenever i try to compile i keep getting error saying i should put a before i and whenever i call the iterator i it would say i is undeclared
student,do we need to have some sort of special commenting for functors similar to rmes for functions
student,i know atoistringcstr gives you the int value of a string but how do you check if the string itself is a number or not
student,both erase and insert in listh have the requires clause requires i is a valid iterator associated with this list the project spec says that these need to be enforced with assert clauses but i have no idea how to confirm this help

student,would it be acceptable to ask for a regrade request because in our test cases my partner and i had deckh vs deckh i would rather ask on here first so i dont waste your time if this is not an acceptable thing to ask for a regrade thanks
student,where exactly are we suppose to place the friend call to print a stack if we are not allowed to change the public or private sections of stack
student,just to be clear there is no use of the big three in rational stack but a custom big three in list
student,is using atoiinputcstr a valid way to get number inputs it works for all test cases and passed the submit280 but i want to make sure i dont get docked points for it thanks
student,im having a lot of trouble with the template declaration originally i defined the functions outside of the class at the bottom and had it like this template typename t bool listtisempty code here but the compiler would give me an error that said shadows template parm class t every time i had that template declaration confused i moved the implementation inside of the class eliminating my need for the template declaration and it eliminated all of those errors except for one that points to the template at the very top of the file before class list why am i getting this error
student,i am having trouble printing out the top element and i was wondering if i could add an iterator function in listh that is outside the class and returns the last item in the list
student,hey guys the autograder reports an infinite loop for my code however isnt this to be expected since the test cases never send q or controld to the program the email also reports multiple diff mismatches but ive manually checked the diffs and everything else in my output is correct im guessing that the diff mismatches may just be the way its reporting the infinite loop though thanks
student,in class i know we concluded that the big three arent necessary for the iterator class because we are not creating dynamic memory however because we have the erase and insert functions does that mean we do need the big 3 if i have a function like below would i need a copy constructor void newfunctionlistintiterator i listint lst lstinserti 10
student,in my stack class im trying to call other stack functions in some of the member functions for example t result pop but i keep getting errors like stackh in member function ‘const t stacktop const with t int’ stackh96 error no matching function for call to ‘stackpop const’ stackh87 note candidates are t stackpop with t int ive spent forever trying to figure it out any tips thanks
student,why can operator overloads not be declared as virtual eg virtual ostream operatorostream os 0
student,i know someone asked about possible leaks due to string usage earlier but im not sure if this is the same issue can someone help me interpret these results are the possible leaks only due to strings or is something else possible any help is much appreciated
student,can we assume that all rational objects provided to the and operators satisfy the rational classs invariants i understand that we should manage rational objects to follow the invariants but could an instructor testcase provide a rational object that does not satisfy the invariants

student,how would we divide two rational numbers if we have as input 1 2 14 then it should output 128 however the only way to simplify the numbers is to have them as integers and this would involve simplifying rational numbers also is there a way to not round ints down for example in the practice test case when doing 120 our code simplifies it to 00 because we try to turn it into ints in order to simplify thanks
student,in the spec it says that rational numbers are never entered directly by the user should we assume that this is true or check to make sure the input is an integer value
student,i receive 0 in this one but i am pretty sure i have no duplicate code in my counting player just want to know what it is
student,when i use the make test command the program seems to keep running with no output it simply says calc calctest00in calctest00out and then goes to the newline i have let it sit for up to ten minutes and it doesnt change or stop the program does this mean that there is and issue with my program i noticed that at the end of the calctest00in file there is no q so the program would not exit if im not mistaken does there need to be a backup for that
student,when i run my code again the published test cases there are no differences in the output however when i submit to the autograder it tells me that there are one or more diff mismatches how can this be
student,when i run my program with valgrind i get no memory leaks but this message comes up i am unfamiliar with this output my project compiles and runs fine in linux but what does it mean is there a problem with my project
student,this might be a dumb question but ive been stuck here for quite a while but do i implement a delete inodeptr inodeptr 0 to erase the node pointed to by i and if so how do i reconnect the prev and next node because they both end up being node please help
student,my partner and i have received the score for project 4 the score for the project is fine but the score for the test cases is not as expected especially for the playercpp which is 0 so we checked our files and found out that we typed include playerh include handh include cardh include deckh instead of include playerh include handh include cardh include deckh we mistyped the filename which should have been in uppercases in this case can we submit the correct version of the files and request for a regrading for the test case part
student,is there any way we can a description of what each bug was in project 4 or is there a list and i simply missed it
student,is there office hour at ugli basement tonight we cannot find gsis anywhere
student,in the project 4 test cases score report what were the requirements for the deck test cases overview and the player test cases overview in other words how does one lose points in either of these sections or how does one earn a perfect score in these sections thank you
student,will there be office hours after the last day of classes thanks
student,i cannot figure out the correct way to declare countif ive tried templatetypename predicate int stackpredicatecountifpredicate pred const as well as templatetypename predicate int stacktcountifpredicate pred const how is this function correctly declared thanks

student,i just got my score for project 4 and it says i failed the deck published test case i reran the published test case and got two of spades for both cards i received almost full credit for the project so i have a hard time believing that i failed the first published deck test case has anyone else had this problem is there anyway i can check to see how i failed the test
student,hello could one of the instructors please elaborate as to what the counting reimplements entails in the project 4 grade my first assumption is that it means that i made counting a derived class of simple and therefore did not reimplement draw however i lost marks on that section so im assuming my understanding of the test is incorrect thank you in advance
student,is there any way we can see where we stand in our overall grades relative to other students before we take the exam some can obviously be inferred through medians and standard deviations but i would love if we had some other way of determining this thanks
student,are we allowed to add private functions in stackh
student,when i include stackh before all of the other includes at the top of a main file it compile errors saying that it cant find the list constructor but when i included the stackh at the end of the other includes at the top of a main file it compiles fine does anyone have an answer or any idea how i can fix my problem
student,if the stack holds an empty list is the stack considered empty if the stack holds nothing is the stack considered empty or should this never happen if the default constructor is done right
student,for the operator we have to define in stackh it says to print nothing if the list is empty for this i just returned os but i realized that this ends up printing a newline how can i still return os in the function but actually cout nothing
student,if i want to create a new helper class does it have to be declared as static i repeatedly get an error message when i do declare static but it goes away when i dont im asking because i was under the impression that we must declare any new helpers as static
student,i get errors when i try to code my countif function with vs saying that stacktcountif unable to match function definition to an existing declaration i have templatetypename predicate int stacktcountifpredicate pred const code is this incorrect
student,i get a seg fault when i try setting the new firsts prev to 0 i pass all the tests when i take this line out but dont you have to reset the prev first prev 0
student,will we have them for all 5 projects by the time of the exam so we know whether to use them on our study guide or not
student,if so why cant default constructors be declared as private
student,if we never type q such as in calctest00in will the program ever quit
student,ive noticed some minor memory leaks in my code that seem to go away when i switch from using strings to chars although doing so is not practical for actual use are strings known ta cause valgrind to act up what can i do to remedy this thanks
student,this is happening to me what could cause this
student,do we have to use any throw statements when error checking or can we just use assert statements
student,i want to confirm that besides deleting the node in the list erase also links the two surrounding nodes of the now empty space
student,this is the only compile error i get when i run my code stackh114 error list is not a member o listrational i declared this function a friend function and i have no idea what is wrong any help is appreciated
student,if stack contains a list member variable then why does it need a constructor for test00 to compile wouldnt the lists constructor run regardless
student,if the user enters m i understand that the file must call countif and i also included my own function that returns true if an element in the stack is equal to the first element in the stack and i call this function isequal as the pred in my countif function however when i compile i get an error that says error no matching function for call to ‘stackrationalcountifunresolved overloaded function type my isequal function takes a t val and a listt list isequalt val listt list and it is called as follows in my countif function ifpredi list return true what does the error mean does my helper function return something its not supposed to or is it completely implemented incorrectly or am i just calling it wrong from countif thank you
student,for the lists copy constructor the lecture says to initialize member variables and then copy all nodes it does not mention setting the first and last variables after the nodes have been copied what is the rule for this and other functions like copyall where the first and last member variables are no longer valid
student,i keep trying to physically draw out a list and then removeadd items ive found it pretty confusing to do on paper i created this google drawing so that you can manipulate different elements and see what your program has to do just go to file make a copy in order to manipulate httpsdocsgooglecomdrawingsd1xuhfj6b6qttuimbdzsklko6qd1eii3h0ki2qijjhg4edituspsharing
student,so when i step through my list test function using breakpoints my code works like i want without any errors when i just run it all at once it throws a segfault the fact that stepping through it doesnt reveal any bugs is making it very difficult to fix and im wondering if anyones seen this kind of thing before the segfault happens in the provided listtest00cpp ostream overload i use it first to print a list of chars and it works fine then when i make another char list and try and print it it segfaults
student,what does the in top do and why would const t stackttop const give the compilation error expected unqualifed id before token
student,so my project works just fine in xcode but in linux it shows up a really weird result part of it goes like glibc detected calc free invalid next size fast 0x000000000077c040 backtrace lib64libcso60x3911e76166 lib64libcso60x3911e78c93 calc0x4014c0 lib64libcso6libcstartmain0xfd0x3911e1ed1d calc0x400db9 memory map then it gives a memory map for me i have no idea what this mean
student,should the following for loop remove all the nodes from my list or should it call the copy constructor for listintiterator i lstnewbegin i lstnewend i lstnewremovefront according to my test the list remains unchanged after leaving the scope of my for loop not sure if that is correct
student,do we need to use exceptions throwcatch in project 5 or can we assume that the user follows the requires clause
student,why do we have to submit rationalh to the autograder it was my understanding that it didnt need to be modified
student,for insert and erase function are we supposed to check if the iterator is in range because the spec says we should enforce the requires clauses requires i is a valid iterator associated with this list void insertiterator i const t datum
student,after compiling the calccpp exactly as what the spec says i got no error message however if i do calc i get an error message saying no such job if i run it with calc no matter what i type in i get segmentation fault can someone give me a hint what i did wrong i used a whilecin value in my main function to get user input also i really want to know what are the differences between and when do i use main and when do i use mainint argc char argv thanks
student,in order to read into the command input i am using cin input however the compiler is telling me that there is no match for operator in stdcin input what does this error mean and why does it even occur if i am simply reading into standard input also i am currently trying to check the standard input against the different cases so i have a check as follows while input q an error occurs that states that there is no match for the operator which i assume means there is no overload for the operator but i am just trying to compare the two i get the same error for input i am confused as to what the errors mean since i am just trying to use them as they are regularly defined used thanks
student,i used enum to use switch for operators inputs but i dont know why i failed the compiler error is no matching function for call to ‘string2enumstdstring const stdstring 4 const int’ but i do declare a function static t string2enumconst string s const string names const int size anyone can help
student,in the spec it says to submit listh stackh rationalcpp calccpp when doing this i got an error for an incomplete submission and it says the autograder checks for rationalh as well submission was successful after submitting listh stackh rationalh rationalcpp calccpp
student,i figured out how to compare the elements using count if but how can i remove the last element of the stack im assuming i should use removeback from listh but im not sure how to implement this
student,this may be an obvious question but is infinity 10 divided by a negative number say 12 result in negative infinity or positive infinity im asking this because spec defines devision with rational numbers would result in a positive infinity although i dont believe this is right for this example the spec says ab cd adbc which would result in 1201 however im thinking my mistake is that you need to fix the invariant that the negative is always in the numerator before you carry out this operation right that way you would get a value of negative infinity
student,dear eecs 280 staff ive been writing some test cases for my rational class and i came upon an interesting test case what if you have something like this r1 rational10 r2 rational14 r3 r1 r2 assertr3getp 1 r3getq 0 assertr3 rational10 test eqaulity operator r3 r1 r2 assertr3getp 1 r3getq 0 this will fail assertr3 rational10 test eqaulity operator this will fail using multiplication by our formula we get negative infinity which makes intuitive sense however during division we get positive infinity which doesnt make very much intuitive sense i guess what im driving at is should our implementation just always follow the formula or is it possible for there to be exceptions to the formula such as this thank you chris wernette
student,how can you use valgrind with calccpp
student,would declaring a class for a functor within stackh count as changing its public interface im trying to implement command m and my impression is that i need to create a functor and override the operator or is my approach completely off
student,the autograder requests rationalh but the spec doesnt list this as a submitted file did i miss something
student,if we set an iterator to the end of a list is it still considered to be associated with that list for example if we have the following code list int lst1 code that makes lst1 contain 0 1 2 3 list int ls2lst1 list intiterator itr lst1end lst2insertitr 4 should this code throw an error because itr is not associated with lst2 or can end be considered to point past the end of any list of the same type as the same type as the creator list
student,for stacks countif method and overload the function declarations come with their own template formatting for themselves template typename u and template typename predicate do we have to add a template typename t somehwere to make these functions work with lists and stacks if not how do we accomplish this
student,stoi included in string accepted by autograder
student,when i test calctest01cpp we are getting a segmentation fault when we look deeper it turns out that the number 0 is not getting entered onto the stack when we try to enter 0 by itself and use a it does not print 0 what is a useful way to fix this thanks in advanced
student,for calccpp what type of variable could hold operators such as i know that chars can hold letters and numbers but can char holds operators
student,can we assume that if and are inputed that well already have two rational numbers in the stack likewise can we assume that if d r and p are inputed that well already have one rational number in the stack if not do we just do nothing when these inputs are called until we have enough rational numbers
student,can we use cstr when passing an input string into atoi or does this violate the specs telling us not to convert to cstrings
student,i declared the end function in the class as such iterator end const i then tried to declare it as such template typename t listtiterator listtend const code here the second line returns the error expected constructor destructor or type conversion before list what does this error mean ive tried a ton of different combinations for this line of code in terms of scope resolution but nothing seems to be working other than eliminating the need for scope resolution operators by defining the function inside the class
student,im using the gcd function from lab03 to find the greatest common divisor between pin and qin however i keep getting a segmentation error due to stack overflow whenever this function is called with pin and qin 1 any advice on fixing this memory bug
student,im trying to use the abs function if it is allowed would be nice for an instructors advice thanks
student,from 23functorscpp so we have the inrange functor can anyone help explain the syntax used effects returns true if pred returns true for any of the elements in l template class predicate bool anyofconst listint l predicate pred forlistintiterator ilbegin ilend i if predi return true return false template class predicate this makes the class templated so we can use different types with it what is predicate is that just a name we chose bool anyofconst listint l predicate pred so creates the function which accepts a list of type int and a predicate forlistintiterator ilbegin ilend i this runs through all of the ints within the list class using the iterator if predi return true this puts a pointer to the current int through the predicate we feed into the function if the predicate returns true function returns true our function then returns false if the predicate is false so i guess a predicate is a functor that we supply into the function just like how in line 58 anyofl g6 g6 is a version of greatern greatern g66
student,when we try to initialize rational r100 should the constructor recognize the 10 and change it into a 1 or can we assume that all infinity number initializations are 10
student,do we need to take the inputs for the calculator at the command line or can we cin the information
student,are we allowed to pop the top element off the list store it as temp pushtemp then return temp or does this technically modify the stack
student,i can currently only push ints onto the stack how can i push a rational onto the stack
student,i have just about everything else to a state where i can test it but i dont understand how to implement top how can i access the first item without pulling it off of the stack
student,what is the ampersand for when you overload an operator for example type operator
student,in calccpp we declare a stack using stackrational s but any functions we try to use that has to do with rational after this point gives us an error about an undefined reference to whatever function from rational that we are using
student,in the specs it says that popspushitem results in the stack being equivalent to s and returns the item and topspushitem results item but we cant call it pops or tops since they do not take in any arguments how would we go about calling pop and top in a scenario identical to the examples above i tried spoppushitem but was given an error request for member push spushitempop gave me an invalid use of void spop and stop work fine as function calls though
student,i was trying to watch videos of prof ringenbergs lectures but i can no longer find the bluereview tab as i did a couple of months ago what happened
student,when run my project in xcode all of the test cases work fine and have the correct out put but when i run everything on caen linux i get a segmentation fault i have figured out that once a clear is done on the stack only numbers can be inputed and whenever anything else is inputed namely things that use this loop for printing and assertions that use count if fortypename listtiterator i listbegin i listend i it returns a seg fault ive looked over my code and cannot seem to find why it is happening on caen but not xcode thanks
student,hi im having trouble figuring out how exactly to validate my input into the calculator i want my program to know that the operators are chars and the numbers are ints but dont know how to do this at run time so much can someone help thanks
student,i assumed that the template typename t at the top of the list class declaration would allow me to implement lists methods elsewhere in listh as follows listtmethod however it looks like that each member method implemented outside of the list declaration needs template typename t before it why is this
student,when i try to use cout in the overload operator for in stackh i get the error that cout was not defined in this scope do i need to include a different system header or something to get cout to work in a h file
student,will we have to register for partners for this project
student,when will submit280 be up for project 5
student,im confused on how to implement this the spec says not to pop all the elements and im guessing i cant use removeback from list i know how to compare the elements just not removing the last element would i use iterator erase
student,can i add helper functions in rationalcpp in order to check the invariants if so how can i do that thanks
student,i have a function called checkinvariants that is called when the getp and getq functions are called am i okay to not check the invariants for the operator functions because if rational number are being sent there it is already implied that the invariants are enforced since they had to be constructed at some point
student,when i call exit0 with input q my destructors for stack and list are not called and there are memory leaks however when i return 0 the destructors get called and there are no memory leaks why is this happening am i allowed to call return 0 instead of exit0
student,should we be changing the values of p and q in getp and getq or would it be smarter to do all the reducinginvariant manipulating within the constructors i feel like its the latter
student,little confused on this part i tried googling but nothing seems to work ctrl d by default seems to infinitely print whatever was previously in the output stream if i try running the given inputs using calc calctest00in i get an infinite loop when i ctrl c and diff the output it matches what exactly is eof i dont remember anything on this and any help would be helpful
student,we included all of these in calccpp and it claims string is an unexpected typename is there something we are missing include iostream include string include cstdlib include cassert include cmath include stackh include rationalh using namespace std thanks for the help
student,listint l linsertfront1 typename listintiterator i lbegin i am trying to declare an iterator for testing purposes this codelast line keeps giving me error c2899 typename cannot be used outside a template declaration msvc 2012 or error using ‘typename’ outside of template g has anyone hadbeen able to resolve this problem thanks
student,is it ok if we copy part of the code posted in 22listh to implement iterator in listh of project 5 will this be considered as violation of the honor code
student,im still having trouble writing this function but i understand what it should do how can i take the iterators node pointer and remove the node from the list the useful list functions are private can someone please advise me on how to perform the erase thanks
student,can we assume that the predicate argument will always contain either a functor or function pointer that only returns 1 or 0
student,im a bit unsure on checking if the string is an integer or not then converting it is there a function in the cstd library that does this
student,while using valgrind we achieved no leaks are possible but while running it we received many invalid readwrite of size 8 and 4 is this a cause for concern
student,im a bit hazy on ctors and dtors does the iterator for list not need a destructor the sample code posted online includes a default ctor but no dtor or custom ctor are they required for a functional iterator im currently getting a compile error of expected ctor dtor or type conversion before list any clarification is greatly appreciated
student,will our calculator be reading in commands from the keyboard from a file or both thanks
student,when i try to declare a friend class in list such as friend class stack i get an error that says stack class template has already been declared as a nonclass template i am curious as to what the error means and if i am using the friend call correctly if not how would i go about using friend class stack or any friend call in general thank you
student,on the slides for iterators the iterator class was declared in the list class so that it could have access to the node type so does this mean the iterator class can see all the private members of list however it does not work the other way and if the node type were a class how would this affect the whether the iterator
student,hint for this function to access the private list variable you will need to declare it as a friend function in the class declaration above how do we go about declaring this operator a friend function i tired the following in the public section of stackh friend stdostream operatorstdostream os const stackt obj but i get an error from that can someone help me out with how to declare the function a friend
student,are we allow to modify in iterator in listh
student,probably a dumb question but for template typename u stdostream operatorstdostream os const stacku obj if i was to use an iterator to output each element would i declare it as typename listuiterator i blah blah blah or does it need another typename im just thrown off by using u instead of t
student,dumb question where exactly do we use the erase function i would assume in a place where you need to erase things duh but these cases seem to me like removefront removeback removeall and perhaps the arithmetic functions in calcpp when you take items off the list and replace them with what they calculate to be for example 4 2 would result in a stack of 8 but i feel like pop takes care of removing these items thoughts
student,this is a silly question but does anyone know how to change the gedit cursor from a block to a line i accidentally turned it on and its really annoying
student,i write 3 helper functions of invariance they are all return bool value i have a few questions 1 can we use void function like void invariant 2 does the basic function of invariant is to change the data variable 3 do we need to assert each in front of each rational member function thank you
student,or do i have to write another iterator class in stackh
student,at the top of stackh it says a templated stack based on a linked list but that im not allowed to modify the classs public interface does this mean i cannot declare class stack public list i am confused as to how i can call list functions in stack
student,how do we stream in the inputs from the test cases were not using fstream correct
student,will vidal host a final review office hour in the weekends
student,okay im getting a very strange error with my removefront function in the list class i wrote the function very similar to what is shown in lecture and the logic makes sense but i get a seg fault whenever i try to run the test the thing that is very strange is if i print out int num in listtest00cpps for loop where were removing the 4 nodes we just put into the list the seg fault wont happen but it still wont pass the assert furthermore when i print out the nodes it is printing the correct nodes that should be removed each time the function is called for example the output will be 0 1 2 3 then the assert error this is very confusing because this tells me it is correctly returning the value that should be removed but it is for some reason not saying the list is empty again my implementation is pretty much the exact same as what was used in lecture i also dont understand why when i get rid of the line of code that prints out each node that should be removed it instead seg faults and never even reaches the assert finally to add to my confusion i attempted to remove each element without assigning the returned node to any kind of variable and it works perfectly itll pass the assert and there are zero seg faults so for example i changed the main code to be lstremovefront lstremovefront lstremovefront lstremovefront assertlstisempty for whatever reason this works perfectly fine but if i try to use a for loop like forint i 0 i 4 i lstremovefront itll seg fault again im at a loss for why these inconsistencies are happening any help is appreciated as i know this is probably very confusing to understand what is happening to me
student,i know we are supposed to use count if in this function could anyone give some hints to modify the pred need to use in the m
student,my calc seemingly works when i put command line arguments in eg calc 1 2 p but when i try to run the unit tests given calc calcin argc evaluates to 1 any idea why this may be
student,the spec says since your classes for list and stack are templates it will be trivial to create a calculator for rationals this statement contradicts my intuition to declare a stack as follows stackrational s i guess im confused by the wording on page 7 specifically the usage of trivialthe above declaration is correct despite the spec saying it is trivial to make it work for rationals right
student,im very confused exactly how the input is coming into the program the spec mentions that were reading from the standard input stream and writing to the standard output stream my understanding is that this is from the keyboard meaning that for the test file the inputs are to be entered by hand into the terminal and each newline in the test input file represents an enter am i correct in this understanding or are we meant to redirect the input stream to read from the test files
student,whats the best way to create an iterator in a main function for testing purposes say for example i had a list of 0 1 2 3 4 5 and i wanted to create an iterator that points to the 3 node so i could call listeraseiterator and test whether the correct node was being deleted im struggling to think about how to do this without accessing the private member variables of list thanks
student,is lab 12 graded the instructions say not collected at the top but then later discuss the files that we need to turn in and ctools seems to be accepting submissions for it i actually finished it already but when i opened it today the cpp file was mysteriously blankid rather not have to redo it if we dont have to turn it in
student,im not understanding this line from the spec endoffile eg typing controld on linux also must exit the calculator with a 0 exit value simply call exit0 it says endoffile must exit calculator with a 0 exit value would return 0 at the end of the main work the same way and what does it mean by typing control d
student,hi im am confused by the spec because it doesnt really tell us when the program is supposed to quit obviously if someone types q it should quit it got that but the test input didnt type q and still the program seemed to know when to quit and it didnt appear that the program was supposed to quit after the user enters enter either so what determines when the program ends thanks
student,im having trouble making a list of strings liststringsentence i have included string why do i get a compiler error
student,what happens to a front or end iterator when the node it points to is removed with removefront or removeback respectively do those functions have to do anything or does the code outside of the list class need to take care of it
student,if we throw a rectangle type which is derived from shape and we have catchshape s then catchrectangle s which one will catch the thrown rectangle
student,im trying to make a for loop in the overload function in stackh but im getting an error expected expression any idea what im doing wrong template typename t fortypename stackulisttiterator i objlistbegin i objlistend i
student,i posted this before but it got buriedignored before the problem was solved im trying to get stacktest00 to work right now it passes fine when compiled with the g flag or the o1 and g flags but with just the optimization flag o1 it seg faults without me changing any code this problem was there one day gone the next day and now it is back im really not sure how to fix this or find why or where the seg fault occurs since running gdb after the code has been optimized is more or less gibberish to me all i can get from it by running backtrace after the segfault is that the seg fault occurs in test in stacktest00cpp ive tested my list class extensively including checking invariants the the beginning and end of each member function and i am fairly certain it works correctly
student,whats the difference of these three how to decide which one to use thanks
student,does calccpp terminate after the user finishes inputing on the command line and presses enter or does the user still have the option to calculate a different input until they enter q so for example is calctest00cpp running the program 3 times for each individual line 25 17 6 32 p a c enter 47 39 p 7 8 a c enter 47 49 37 p 5 a c enter im trying to figure out when to exit my while loop
student,when i do something like triangle t triangle other t is the copy constructor running or the assignment operator suppose we overwrote both of them
student,i want to make a list from scratch using only insert the following code listintlst output list listintiterator it lstbegin lstinsert it 4 output list 4 lstinsert it 3 output list 4 3 lstinsert it 2 output list 4 3 2 lstinsert it 1 output list 4 3 2 1 produces 4 3 2 1 however i think it should be 1 2 3 4 i think that the 4 3 2 1 function is occurring because the iterator pointer thinks its pointing off the end of the list since its pointing to the 0 before first however in my insert code when i put the first node in a list i also set the iterator equal to first this obviously isnt working any advice
student,should there be a case where we can insert a node after the last node im just being paranoid
student,do you have to implement copyall using the iterator class
student,when i call erase on my list 1 2 3 4 it correctly removes whatever node my iterators node pointer is pointed to however when i erase the middle parts of the list 2 and 3 i get a seg fault at the very end of my program valgrind says that i have no leaking memory and i make sure to set the iterators node pointer to 0 within erase so theres no dangling pointers any advice into what this seg fault is
student,with the double const in this const t top const when trying to define this function outside of the class would i define it something like this template typename t stacktconst t top const
student,i used the operator overload code from the lecture slides but when i try to use it in the erase function i get this error message error cannot increment value of type listintiterator any idea how to fix this thanks
student,if we call erase with an iterator can we assume that we will no longer use said iterator on the list for examplesuppose that in my erase function i delete whatever node i points to and then set my is nodeptr to 0 so its not dangling this obviously means that i can no longer use my iterator to traverse my list since it fails the prefix iterators requires clause can i assume that i will never need to use the iterator again after using it to erase a node i hope this question makes sense
student,do we need to overload the assignment operator for the iterator do we need to make a copy of the the list put it in a new list then set the iterators node pointer to point at the new list
student,will professor deorios lecture from today april 16 be posted online to watch
student,what happens if we use staticcast instead of dynamiccast to cast from a polymorphic base class to a derived class thanks for any help
student,i would like to complete the course evaluation but i attend professor deorios lecture section 002 but am signed up for section 001 how can i submit an evaluation for professor deorio
student,hello whenever i tried to use any of the overloaded operator for iterators in stackh i get an error saying that operator is private within the context of stackh i dont see why this could happen since all the operators are declared public anyone have any idea why
student,i made a functor outside above my int main im just wondering if its ok to do it this way i just straight up declared class functor im worried that i might have to add something extra to the declaration like if you made a helper function to had to include static or if you made a global variable you had to make it const and so on also the spec says to use strings instead of cstrings is it ok if i converted my strings into ints by first making it a c string by like mystringcstr then using atoi on it
student,just to totally clarify am i allowed to add private member variablesfunctions to list i know we can for iterator
student,when i try to compile and run listtest00cpp i get this error in function main listtest00cpptext0x31 undefined reference to listintlist collect2 ld returned 1 exit status make listtest00 error 1 any idea what this error is
student,there is no big three declaration in list class do we need to add it in the declaration part
student,since the spec says that we must use listh to implement the stack does that just mean that we use our list functions in our stack functions for example will the isempty function in stack simply call isempty in list thank you
student,im getting the following errors when compiling stackh this all comes on the line where i set up the iterator to cycle through the list i finished up listh and it seems to work fine but its as if i didnt even include it in stackh i double checked and its there any suggestions thanks stackh118 error nonmember function int countifpredicate cannot have cvqualifier stackh in function int countifpredicate stackh121 error t was not declared in this scope stackh121 error template argument 1 is invalid stackh121 error invalid type in declaration before token stackh121 error list was not declared in this scope stackh122 error invalid type argument of unary
student,for the list iterator is the begin function given in listhstarter supposed to work out of the box adding one line of code to listtest00cpp to use the operator as provided gives the error listtiteratoriteratorlisttnode with tint is private within this context with this context being the line return iteratorfirst in iterator begin const as provided in the starter h file is this intended and any hints about what to do to fix this
student,for the implementation of the rational class i am testing the operator in the arithmetic laws provided in the handout if 45 37 is called then 4335 is the answer however since we never want a negative q the constructor changes the 4 to 4 and the 5 to 5 however 45 37 is 4335
student,so im trying to think of things to check when checking for the upholding of invariants for the list class so far this is what i have 1 when the list is not empty make sure the first and last pointers point to ground or 0 2 if the list is empty make sure the first and last pointers both point to ground or 0 can anyone else think of anything else that might be worth checking cheers
student,with an empty list i know first and last both point to 0 but do their respective prev and next pointers also point to 0 this makes sense in terms of programming but logically seems a bit loopy in effect first and last and their respective prev and next pointers would be pointing at the same thing weird ehh
student,when will the autograder be up for p5
student,please explain the push function in stack does this function add a value to the top of the list or does it take a value in the list and put it at the top of the list
student,hi im trying to cin in to int variable and if the stream cin in an operator like or i have an if statement that checks cinfail if the cinfail is true i just cin clear and cin to a char variable however the char variable is not reading in the or operators but it can read the other operators like or i dont know what is causing this but im guessing its because the cin operator is expecting an integer after the or which is causing strange things to happen should i maybe try cin to a string variable and converting the string to a integer instead
student,im probably missing something obvious but how do i call the erase and insert functions within iterator ive tried listintiteratorerasei and listinterasei amongst many others but my test file will never compile
student,is there a need to create a stack constructor or destructor if so how would one go about doing it the same question applies to the rational destructor but i feel i already have the answer to that since no memory is being allocated to the heap at least in my implementation which means a destructor is not needed but i wanted to just make sure
student,i used exit0 when user input q was encountered in calccpp like the spec says to do but when running valgrind my program leaked memory any time the program was exited with q i did some research and found this httpstackoverflowcomquestions7054685aredestructorsrunwhencallingexit which seems to suggest that calling exit0 will skip the calling of destructors after main i fixed this by just using break instead of exit0 i figured i should post this in case anyone else was puzzled by a memory leak is this a problem with the spec or is it a known leak that wont be penalized in the grading process
student,the function signature in stackh is const t top const i dont see why we need to return a reference here because we cant return anything that isnt a variable local to that method which will be destroyed after it runs using a static variable would work but that seems like a bad solution for a problem that could easily be avoided by using a different return type
student,when i try to compile my ifcount function i use an iterator and a for loop in the loop i use the operator like we did in class however i keep getting following compiler error listh156 error invalid initialization of nonconst reference of type ‘bool’ from a temporary of type ‘bool’ what could be causing this
student,q quit exit the calculator with a 0 exit value this input is always valid endoffile eg typing controld on linux also must exit the calculator with a 0 exit value simply call exit0 o k so how do we make controld exit the calculator with an exit value i can make it exit when the user inputs a q but im a little fuzzy as to how to make it exit0 when the user types controld i mean how does one even do that
student,as of right now the main part of my code in countif is this for listtiterator i listbegin i listend i count predi every time i try to compile my code without having edited the stacktest00cpp file i get a bunch of warning error messages saying that was expected before i and i was not declared in this scope can somebody please explain what the error message might mean
student,im having a hard time figuring out how to keep this invariant in check any hints invariant 2 for nonzero p and q p and q should not have a common factor other than 1 eliminate any common factors when p is 0 make sure q is 1
student,for match it is required to pop the last element off is the last element the top element
student,when overloading the or operators for the iterator are we checking to see if two iterators point at the same item or that the pointedat values are the same
student,just to clarify when we add the element before the node at i does before mean its closer to the top of the list than i or farther away from it
student,under lecture in ctools and lab11 we have code given to us for listh when applicable are we allowed to use that code
student,i want to modify next in the node struct in listh and my iterator i how could i get the value of the next in the node i pointed to
student,im not sure i completely understand why all the function implementations have to be in the h file why would the compiler not be able to see its a template class and just go to the cpp file thats linked to it and then see the member functions there
student,for removefront and removeback in listh the return type is t and not void are we returning the value of the datum that is being removed from the list the provided rme clauses in listhstarter dont specify what is being returned thanks
student,when implementing the list insertfront and insertback what should next or prev be set to if they are pointing out of the list more clearly if i am setting up a new first element should its prev be equal to zero or null or some other value likewise for next for a new last element thanks
student,in the rme for the overloaded operator for rational it says note that ab cd is algebraically equivalent to adbcbd shouldnt it be ab cd most people should probably catch that themselves but you asked us to report stuff so there you go
student,hi are we allowed to use helper functions declared static in our implemented files
student,could someone explain the differences between definitely lost indirectly lost possibly lost and still reachable in addition how will we be graded in this regard ie do all four need to be 0 to receive full credit i have some memory that is possibly lost and still reachable but am not sure how to interpret this or go about debugging it
student,so both of these functions seem to imply that the invarients should be forced initially in these functions i set up everything in the constructor but was that incorrect should i just set p to pin and q to qin in the constructor and make sure everything actually makes sense in the getq function
student,in the pop function declaration const t pop what does the mean in this context
student,remember that these invariants must hold after the rational object is constructed and throughout its lifetime but they do not apply to the two parameters passed in to the constructor the parameters passed into the constructor can be arbitrary integers and the constructor should always succeed accordingly your implementation of the constructor must manipulate pq based on equivalences eg reducing the fraction moving or canceling the negative signs to satisfy the invariants the parameters passed into the constructor can be arbitrary integers and the constructor should always succeed ok to me this says hey pin and qin can be whatever the hell the user want them to be 00 00 11 01 01 etc either im incorrect or the code visualization is wrong thoughts clarification donuts
student,so if i wanted to write a helper function in rationalcpp static void checkinvariants const is this something i could do i know p and q are private variables but if i declared this function a friend function i could be able to access p and q but that would require me to modify rationalcpp which we are not allowed to do thoughts if this is not possible im guessing i just have to manually ensure that p and q follow the representation invariants when i create a rational object via either the default the pin qin constructor or fetch the p and q values via getp and getq this seems like poor inefficient code structure to me but if i have to do this its fine
student,how should the rational operator print if q were equal to 0 in other words what if p was 1 and q was 0 would it print 10 or something else like infinity if p were equal to 0 and q were 0 would it print 00 or something else like undefined
student,im having trouble making the operator overload function in stackh a friend of the stack class i put this exact code into the private section of the stack class friend stdostream operatorstdostream os const stackt obj
student,is the following code considered bad the pointer p goes out of the scope of the array a int main int a3 123 int p a p3 5 cout a3 endl
student,im not doing this correctly but i cant seem to get the syntax right how do you declare the overloaded assignment operator below is my current usage which will not compile listtlist operator const list l
student,it says on the schedule that on sundays there is drop in tutoring in the basement of the ugli but ive been the past couple weeks and am unable to find any of the tutors are there signs im missing should i have a special spideysense help would be appreciated thanks
student,besides the examples given in the spec are there other rules for adding subtracting multiplying and dividing infinity or undefined rational number
student,in calccpp many commands including require a stack with at least two operands do we need to write assert to check that
student,im currently dealing with a situation where stacktest00 only commits a seg fault when the optimization flag o1 is included when compiling im not sure how to find the location of where the seg fault is occurring as using valgrind and gdb with the optimized code only gives me memory addresses where the seg fault occurs and im not sure how to translate this into a line number the only thing ive been able to deduce is that it happens after the first push call in stacktest00 my push function just calls listinsertfrontitem so im not sure why this would cause a problem what is the best way to find the location of a seg fault when it only occurs with optimization
student,this is probably a dumb question but for listh in project5 are we allowed to use implementations with the same syntax as provided to us in lab11 modified to work as a doublylinked list or will we be required to come up with a significantly different implementation
student,hi i had a question about how to use the countif function in the project spec the example code illustrates iseven as a functor which just has an overloaded operator the spec then shows passing this functor directly into the countif function scountifiseven i ran into a bunch of problems with this when i tried to compile my code i got it to work however when i declared iseven outside of main and when i declare an instance of iseven so basically my working test code looks like this class iseven bool operator int n return n 2 0 main declaration of stack s and other code iseven evenone scountifevenone return 0 overall im wondering if this is correct syntax the code works here but im confused on two specific points 1 why does this only work if i declare iseven outside of main 2 why does it only work when i declare the instance of iseven evenone and not when i pass it directly through as countifiseven as the project spec says thanks for any help
student,in my removefront function for list everything works perfectly but i realized when i hcanged the first variable its previous node pointer wasnt pointing to 0 which it should be since there should be nothing before the first node so when i went back in and set the new firstprev pointer equal to 0 it gives me a segmentation fault i do the exact same thing with my removeback funciton setting the new lastnext to 0 and that works perfectly fine does anyone have an idea of why this is happening
student,if we are not allowed to change rationalh does that mean we automatically cant add and implement the big 3
student,say there is a pointer to a node stored on the heap node pointer first delete pointer does that delete the pointer or does that delete the node that is stored on the heap first
student,when it says keep q as always 0 does it mean to change the value of q for the constructor that has a qin if it is less than 0 or should we use an assert to crash the program in that case
student,the spec states inf inf undefined does that mean inf inf undefined what about inf inf and infinf
student,im a little unclear as to how to print the stack in the specs examples the top element is printed at the end see description of command m however in the overloaded operator for a stack we are told to print the stack with the top element first these seem to conflict
student,are we allowed to overload other operators in addition to the required ones eg postfix prefix or postfix etc
student,why does the spec include this line g ­wall ­werror ­pedantic ­o1 stacktest00cpp –o stacktest00cpp wouldnt this essentially erase the stacktest00cpp file and replace it with the executable
student,hi i was using the following declaration in stackh listtiterator itr when i am trying to compile my code the compiler has an error that say it expect an before itr i have absolutely no idea what is up with that any ideas thanks
student,for the function stdostream operatorstdostream os const stacku obj print all the elements of the stack starting from the top element should we use top in this function to ensure that the first element printed is at the same end of top or push for example if top returns the last element of the list then the function should print the list backwards can we simply print the list backwards without using top as long as i know the first element to be printed is defined as the top element in top and push
student,when i try to implement stacks function by traverse by iterator xcode builds fail however isnt it valid to use any interface of list i do put the iterator class inside the public section of list
student,do we need to write rme for the big three other operation override functions
student,the spec says that the list class should not have any friends would i be breaking this rule if i declare friend class list in my iterator private
student,does the following memcheck report indicate that i have no memory leaks im not clear how to interpret the results
student,can someone explain to me how we can determine if we need to implement the big three when would we not need them
student,does the function still insert something if the list is empty
student,if i want to implement the iterator out of the class what is the format i keep having error for this line template typename t listtiteratornodeptrnull
student,i know we have to implement the overloaded operator for the stack class but i cant seem to find the definition for the overloaded operator for the list class could someone point it out to me cheers
student,eg countifpred is 0 for an empty stack for a nonempty stack say spushitem where item is pushed on a stack s countifpred will be the sum of scountifpred and either 1 or 0 depending on whether item satisfies pred respectively ok so as i understand it for a non empty stack if you push an item onto the stack the stack will include all the items that it had previous to the push operation and the item that was pushed onto the stack via the push operation ok if the gist of countif is to return the number of items in the stack for which predicate preddatum returns true wouldnt it just make sense for the return value of scountifpred to be the number of data inside s for which preddatum returns true this the sum of scountifpred and either 1 or 0 depending on whether item satisfies pred respectively is throwing my head for a bit of a loop right now cheers
student,the requires clause states i is a valid iterator associated with this list how do we use assert to check that
student,hey if anyone needs a partner for project 5 email me at ahasnumichedu thanks
student,the spec says that you must not change the public interface of the list class so could i declare and define the default copy constructors destructor and assignment operator inside the public of list class same thing in the public of iterator can i declare and define the copy constructor destructor assignment operator operators inside the public
student,in the provided test case for list they use the dereferencing operator on an iterator to return its datum however i currently have my dereferencing operator returning the node it is pointing to is this acceptable way to implement this if not would it be okay to implement the operator to return the node it is pointing to
student,to implement erase and insert isnt it necessary to access the previous and next nodes there is currently no function to return the current node in order to access these so are we allowed to create a function to do so
student,the effect of erase is removes a single element from the list container does that mean we need to fill this spot with an empty node and i am confused about what insert should do inserts datum before the element at the specified position so we should insert datum to the iterator whose position is before i
student,hello i just need some clarificationconfirmation for the insert function it will apparently inserts datum before the element at the specified position since this is a doubly linked list what is the definition for before if lets say our iterator is pointing at 2 and we want to insert 5 do we get case 1 1 2 3 4 1 2 5 3 4 case 2 1 2 3 4 1 5 2 3 4 thanks
student,should copyall assume the list is empty or should we empty the list first before copying the nodes from one list to the other the copyall shown in lecture only added the copied list to the current list but did not handle any of the nodes in the current list
student,in task 1 of lab 11 when i print i inside of the loop with the iterator im printing a bunch of memory addresses instead of the animal types does anyone know why my loop looks nearly identical to the code given in lecture except it has animal as the list type instead of ints thank you
student,did we need to have our uniquename on our project 4 files i notice that the spec didnt call for them but project 5 spec does
student,i tried to compile rationalcpp and got the following errors it seems the function definitions in rationalh contain too many arguments and were not supposed to modify that file am i doing something wrong heres the compiler errors rationalcpp51 error ‘stdostream rationaloperatorstdostream const rational’ must take exactly one argument rationalcpp61 error ‘rational rationaloperatorconst rational const rational’ must take either zero or one argument rationalcpp72 error ‘rational rationaloperatorconst rational const rational’ must take either zero or one argument rationalcpp83 error ‘rational rationaloperatorconst rational const rational’ must take either zero or one argument rationalcpp94 error ‘rational rationaloperatorconst rational const rational’ must take exactly one argument rationalcpp104 error ‘bool rationaloperatorconst rational const rational’ must take exactly one argument
student,just to clarify if i were to declare a private member function does this count in any as modifying the public interface i dont personally think it is however im very good at being paranoid thanks
student,template typename t t listtremovefront stdcout fixme removefront do something with lastn assertisempty node victim first first firstnext t result victimdatum delete victim victim0 return result so this is part of the file 22listh file provided to us from lecture could someone please explain to me why exactly we need to do something with last if we are just removing the front node it shouldnt affect the last pointer should it
student,in lecture professor deorio made mention of the null or 0 value that we linked the singly linked list to he called it a ground the way the linked list would work is that the first is linked to the second second to third and etc etc until we reach the last member of the list the last member of the list was a node that contained a node pointer next and for the last member of the list this next pointer pointed to the ground or 0 for the doubly linked list should the node pointer prev inside the first member of the list point to this same ground or 0 value or should it point to the last node of the list in effect circling around to the back of the list
student,hey if anyone needs a partner for project 5 email me at natejkumichedu thanks
student,i had spoken with professor prakash today after lecture and i had a question about timing and the autograder he had told me to post the question on piazza and clarify it here if one wanted to test the adt thoroughly the only way apart from seeing the code would be to test every possibility if we take for example the simple bet function the adt could have a specific bug say the function returns a negative value for bankroll 10 and minimum 1 i have made test cases that test every possible case the thorough test for bet and the thorough test for draw both take a very long time over 15 mins to be a little more specific the draw for example has to test all the 82 possible combinations of cards a player can have in blackjack without busting i just wanted to know if i should include these kind of tests and what the autograder does when it comes across a very long test case does it return 0 or nonzero or do something completely different one thing professor prakash mentioned is that i could include it as the last test most buggy implementations would fail some test case before thank you
student,should we have something that will stop the program if the user uses wrong inputs
student,how are we being graded for test cases
student,can we assume that when testing the counting class we dont need to check the draw function i dont want to repeat all my draw test cases for simpleplayer when the function should be inherited anyway
student,i was comparing my output with my friend i found i often got program ended with exit code 1 but the rest of my output were right i do have a return 0 at the end of main can someone tell me why i was using xcode thank you
student,when i use the diff in linux all i get is could someone help me with this im not sure what this means
student,in project 4 when making our test cases do we have to test for nonsense inputs aka do we have to test for an integer not between 0 and 52 in decks shuffle function given this is a requirement in the functions rme
student,if i run the my blackjack program with the same inputs in the command line every time should the outputs and final results ie the number of hands played be the same every time i am not sure how the randcpp randomizes number but if it gives the same numbers in sequence every time then this makes sense
student,if an ace has been counted as an 11 once before can that same ace switch to a 1 later on if it is more advantageous to the player
student,could someone tell me at what point my bankroll goes wrong my shuffle seems to lag behind and im trying to pinpoint where it occurs starting bankroll 1000 hand 20 40 60 80 100 120 140 160 180 200 220 bankroll 995 965 1012 1022 1059 1076 1051 991 1019 1008 998
student,hi im having a problem making my overview files i have made just a blank document in c xcode and then named it decktestoverview and playertestoverview and then put in all my stuff but then when i upload them to mfile and submit i get a message that says error decktestoverview doesnt exist but when i look in mfile i clearly have decktestoverview placed there everything is spelled correctly i then went back and made txt files of them but it still wont let me name them decktestoverview and submit them any ideas would be greatly appreciated
student,do we announce dealers total if player has busted
student,are we allowed to include randh and use the getcut function in our test cases thanks
student,for the draw function of playercpp do we need to test the situation when the player is bust or has natural 21
student,i coded the entire project on ubuntu with codeblocks with g compiler and everything compiled fine and all the code output was correct but just as im about to submit through caen environment the caen environment gives me a compile error deckcpp in constructor u2018deckdecku2019 deckcpp33 error u2018decku2019 is not a member of u2018decku2019 deckcpp36 error u2018decku2019 was not declared in this scope deckcpp in member function u2018void deckresetu2019 deckcpp45 error u2018decku2019 was not declared in this scope deckcpp48 error u2018decku2019 was not declared in this scope deckcpp in member function u2018void deckshuffleintu2019 deckcpp81 error u2018decku2019 was not declared in this scope deckcpp85 error u2018decku2019 was not declared in this scope deckcpp90 error u2018decku2019 was not declared in this scope deckcpp96 error u2018decku2019 was not declared in this scope deckcpp102 error u2018decku2019 was not declared in this scope deckcpp in member function u2018int deckcardsremaining constu2019 deckcpp117 error u2018decku2019 was not declared in this scope which is weird because i got all the right outputscompiled correctly on my ubuntu g compiler laptop just to make sure we accessedit private member variables with member functions of the same class as such right in h file class testclass int privatevar public void incrementer in cpp file void testclassincrementer privatevar
student,if you test a certain bug but not any others on a certain test file if there is a bug that it didnt test that allows it to go through will the test file be thrown aside even if it tests what you said it would for example one test file tests say the decks shuffle function but not the cardsremaining function if the deck given has a buggy cardsremaining function will that test file be thrown away even though it correctly judges shuffle thanks
student,just a quick question do we need to also submit randcpp with the rest of our files someone i know did it and it worked for them but i just submitted it without and it also worked anyone know
student,i signed up for the alternate exam but i havent received any response as to whether im eligible for it and the datetime of the alternate final when can i expect to receive these details
student,for player test cpp files do i have to include cardh handh in addition to playerh because the playerh file has already included cardh and handh for me same thing for just the playercpp file do i have to add include the cardh and the handh
student,can it be assumed when writing the player tests that the simple players hitstand strategy is implemented same in the buggy playercpp as the counting players otherwise i would end up writing the exact same tests for two different players which would be unnecessary under the assumption that my previous assumption is true
student,just out of curiosity will there be an incorrect playercpp in which not only rank but suit as well be a determining factor to if a card is drawn or what not
student,does it matter how many rounds are playing for example i wanted to implement competitive by having the player bet a larger amount but when the count exceeds three rather than 2 for this reason my competitive player wins when there are more rounds since he waits to take the risk of betting since he bets more i guess my question is how will the performance of the players be measured
student,which files will our decktest and playertest functions be able to include i assume that decktest would be compiled with cardcpp and a potentially buggy deckcpp thus it would be ok for me to include cardh and declare cards throughout my test case furthermore id assume that the playertest files would be compiled alongside handcpp cardcpp and a potentially buggy playercpp again im just making sure i wont run into a compiler error if i include these respective header files thanks
student,im stumped on this error address doesnt contain a section that points to a section in object file its a run time error that runs after the return statement ideas
student,does this mean i am not allowed to use unsigned int bankroll atoiargv1 thats my current implementation that works but isnt that a global variable
student,since there was a provided decktest00 test case do we have to name our first one decktest00 or decktest01 and should we submit the premade one with ours im assuming we dont but just want to check
student,is there a limit to what we can change for the competitor my draw function is influenced by count to the point where if you diff competitor and countingsimple there are drastic amounts of differences in the cards competitor is more aggressive in drawing can the differences be rather large as in larger than simply betting 3 times the minimum instead of two times thanks
student,if i didnt use the reset function in my constructor is there any use for the reset function in this project i dont find myself using it and it seems a little concerning
student,in my test case i declared multiple counting players and exposed certain cards to certain players upon an hour of confusion and debugging i realized that there is one count that regardless of which player the card is exposed to that count is the one that is altered example player1exposec1ace player2exposec2ten player3exposec3two player1exposec4six player2exposec4six player3exposec4six i displayed the count when expose is called which displayed 1 2 1 0 1 2 this means there is one count being altered regardless of which player is that a bug on my end or can we assume there will only be one player at a time also if it is a bug how do i fix it thanks
student,for the overview many of my test cases test the same thing as immediate previous test cases but with just maybe one number switched is it ok for me to say refer to test case playertestnncppthe above test case but with this value changed to this other value i ask this because like in programming i dont want to repeat stuff thats unnecessary especially since about 20 of my playertests do basically the same thing but with different boundarieshand values
student,just was following the spec on checking to see if my output had any differences when compared to the correct output and it showed that at the very end of the file after player has 105 after 3 hands and whatnot it said that either i had an extra newline or the correct one had a new line after everything and i didnt either way would this newline at the end matter
student,hello i submitted deckcpp cardcpp playercpp blackjackcpp and handcpp without any test cases it is telling me i have a mismatch with the published test cases but i cant find any mismatches between my blackjacktest00out and blackjacktest00outcorrect i used a diff checker i also passed the card and deck tests given to us i was wondering where i could possibly be getting the mismatch from thanks
student,are we allowed to use include deckh to use functions within deck for the player tests
student,so ive managed to get everything done only when my program goes to interact with the player theres no player i used what the spec said and correctly by breakpoints i know this managed to get the string from argv to the function and use strcmp to compare them then using the static pointers i declared like the spec said i return the appropriate one the issue comes up in that i dont actually have those pointers pointing to anything theyre just static pointers of count competitive and simple they kinda point to the classes but not an actual instance which results in errors when i try to modify the player so what are we supposed to do here a different post said to use new to dynamically allocate memory for the pointer to the class but were not supposed to use new nor do i know how p how do i get an instance any help is appreciated
student,in playerh it states for betbankroll min that bankroll min however if it were the case that bankroll min is this something that we would have to account for outside what is expected for the requires clause in my playercpp if this is the case assert0 is tripped however i do not know if the correct player we are testing for would do the same basically if bankroll were less than min i would consider the correct code to return 0 and allowing it to occur to return 1 even though this is incorrect basically im stating that the correct playercpp should fail returning 0 while an incorrect playercpp should pass returning 1 but this is counterintuitive to how we are supposed to write the test cases or am i overthinking this and should assume the requires clauses are obeyed and not have assert0
student,i derived my competitor player from my counting player and i want to use the count variable in competitor count is a protected member variable in my counting player so my competitive can access it when i try competitive count0 the compiler gives me the following error playercpp132 error class competitive does not have any filed name count how do i initialize my count to 0 in competitive
student,each semester over 500 competitor algorithms are submitted do you flag the best card counting methods and take them to the casino would you be willing to share the best methods
student,what should happen if the player is dealt an unnatural 21 and the dealer is dealt either a natural or unnatural 21 additionally does anything special happen if the dealer is ever dealt a natural 21
student,i want to use randcpp in my deck and possibly player tests is this okay and should we include in the overview what files are needed to compile each test
student,how to initialize it using the pointer
student,can we write a getcount function for testing the counting player
student,when testing a certain featurefunction of deck or player can we safely assume that for instance if we are testing a certain function a and using another function b that b is gonna be correctly implemented vice versa when testing b using a or we do need to account for the case where both have bugs
student,how are we supposed to test the counting player like in terms of an endtoend game play not test case submit files were only supplied with one correct output file and that was only for the simple player do we have to step through the program by hand and see who is supposed to score what when that seems like a gigantic pain in the ass
student,well heres the thing i made a small dealing function in my blackjackcpp made the header before maindefined it afterwards and all that part of that function takes in the player pointer and does the shuffled to let them know the count needs to be reset the problem is when it tries to call that function on the player pointer it basically says that pointer isnt defined even though i clearly define that player pointer early on with const char playertype argv3 player gambler playerfactoryplayertype my playerfactory even has a default return of simple so no matter what the gambler should be defined so why am i getting an access violation when i try to use shuffled with the pointer any ideas
student,can we use using namespace std in project 4 in the implementation rules its not listed but some code snippets on the project 4 piazza page that have been answered include it and they havent been yelled at
student,does dealer hits on soft 17 like he has 3 aces and 1 four so this is a soft 17 will he just stand or hit in this project
student,i want to be able to return count so i can use that in one of my test cases how do i go about doing this in a way that works in the specs and wont cause crashing and chaos and doom
student,i tried to call the default constructor in the reset function but it did not work so i created a whole new deck in the reset function and copied what i did in the default constructor but its repetitive i hate copying code how can i fix this
student,int cardsremaining const what happens when the number of left cards is 0 i use the difference between the addresses between 2 pointers one points to the first card in the deck the other points to the next card to deal but if the return value of cardsremaining is 0 then the pointer that points to the next card to deal will go out of the scope how to fix this
student,i know that we need to write test cases to test the functions of the counting class and the three functions of it are bet exposed and shuffled counting derives its draw function from simple so am i supposed to write test functions for draw as well or just the three functions mentioned above
student,im using xcode and when i run one of my tests it is passing the assert statement and printing my message you passed the test right before i return 0 in my main function asserttest cout you passed the test endl return 0 however ive noticed that in xcode sometimes it will say program exited with code 0 and other times it will say program exited with code 1 can someone explain this to me and if this is a problem
student,could an instructor please weigh in on the followup discussion in 1495 mainly i want to know according to spec and rme it isnt clear can and should we reduce a soft hand with an ace counted as 11 by 10 points regardless of the number of cards dealt for example an ace and a two are dealt pts 13 soft hand true then a two is dealt pts 15 then a three pts 18 then a king pts 28 if no change from soft to hard and bust or pts 18 if change from soft to hard thus no difference to score seems to me it should be converted from soft to hard whenever soft flag is true and value exceeds 21
student,will this function always return numbers in a specific order just curious to know so i can use it when writing test cases for deck
student,i know its good style and a good habit to maintain but is it necessary to comment in the test files that we submit
student,i passed the tests but i was wondering in regards to hard and soft do the cards need to stay at their value or can they change during play for example if i have 2 aces and my value is 12 and i receive another ace can my value be 3 now or does it have to be 13
student,when we are writing our test cases can we assume that the constructors for the classes work correctly or should we test those also
student,im trying to declare a counting player like this counting counter but that isnt working how am i supposed to declare a counting player in the test file should i include playercpp and point my variables towards the counting player
student,from the spec you may not have any global variables in the driver but global constants are allowed you may use global state in the class implementations but it must be static and except for the three players const does this mean when we implement the three player classes simple competitive counting that we should declare those classes static also on a sidenote any helper functions we declare in blackjackcpp should have rmes and be static as well correct thanks
student,in terms of testing deal the rme makes no mention of what the function is supposed to do if it tries to deal a card that isnt there aka the next pointer is incremented past the decksize1th spot of the cards array in my implementation i wrote something along the lines of if this function tries to deal a card that is out of bounds of cardsdecksize assert0 now this works for my program just fine obviously because my code compiles and passes the published test cases but in terms of test cases are we to assume that the buggy implementation accounts for this because i am not particularly sure of how to test to see if they accessed an out of bounds piece of memory other than making sure that the address of the pointer that their deal function returns is within bounds of card and carddecksize
student,when we run test cases against our code how to we compile it i know you use the c flag to compile it individually but i want to run it against my code i tried g pedantic wall werror o1 o decktest00 decktest00cpp cardcpp deckcpp for deck tests this is wrong obviously any suggestions
student,has anyone gotten the error error cannot convert ‘card’ to ‘stdiosbasestdiosbase’ in assignment when trying to assign a card return from deckdeal to a card object they declare
student,so the specs said that it might be helpful to cout certain things such as cards and such in the test cases to make it easier but do i have to remove these output before i submit would the cout mess with the return 0 that says the code has no bug
student,is it minimum bet always equal to 5
student,are we going to getting points off if we just have one main function in blackjackcpp which is about 120 lines are we supposed to make helper functions also are we going to getting points off if the competitor strategy is too simple
student,for project 3 after asking around i found that the only difference between my code and the code of those who passed is a return statement im confused because it is my understanding that including return in a void function is not necessary since this appears to be the only difference between my code and correct code either the autograder is wrong i needed a return statement or some other subtle difference in code caused my packreset to fail
student,so the spec says to write your files without interfile dependency does this mean that i cant include cardh in my handcpp file or is that allowed because the h file does not depend on code i made
student,im a little confused on how i would be able to tell if each object in a list is a chicken or not i understand iteration but i dont understand how i would compare classes to find out if it is a chicken or a horse
student,theres no direct way to test the counting players exposed and shuffled other than testing bets correct also just to confirm for my sanity we only need to write test cases for deck and counting player correct
student,whenever i try to declare a counting class variable c like counting c the compiler would say counting was not declared in this scope what is wrong here am i missing something super simple
student,i can make instances of competitor and counting players but not simple player it says that simple is an abstract class isnt player the abstract class
student,since basic strategy of counting player is based on simple player do our test cases have to test for these strategies that are implemented in simple player
student,i have been running blackjack with both the simple and counting players and in every test i have done they both attain the same score i have yet to find a bankroll and hand input combination that makes these two different can people please post what bankroll and hand number command line values they tried that resulted in different scores for simple and counting thanks
student,since card does not have a setter i was trying to use assignment to set a cards private variables yet it seems no operator matches the following operation card tempcardrankj cardsuiti i j are ints being casted into enum cardsk temp cards are private member of deck compiler error on
student,shuffling the deck cut at 39 cut at 22 cut at 33 cut at 37 cut at 38 cut at 37 cut at 38 hand 1 bankroll 100 player bets 5 player dealt queen of spades dealer dealt king of spades player dealt ace of hearts player dealt natural 21 hand 2 bankroll 107 player bets 5 player dealt queen of spades dealer dealt six of diamonds player dealt ace of hearts player dealt natural 21 hand 3 bankroll 114 player bets 5 player dealt queen of spades dealer dealt ten of hearts player dealt ace of hearts player dealt natural 21 player has 121 after 3 hands i purposefully dealt the player a natural 21 in each hand to test output after announcing player dealt natural 21 is my program supposed to announce player wins or just move on to the next hand like my program did hand 2 bankroll 107 thanks
student,if the player is dealt these cards ace of diamonds two of clubs ace of clubs nine of hearts should his total at this point be 23 or 13
student,will our test cases be evaluated to check that each testcase returns false only if the adt is incorrect for the specific behavior that case is written to test for i will use deckdeal in several of my testcases to evaluate the composition of a deck if deckdeal is incorrectly implemented each test case that makes use of deckdeal will return a nonzero value in addition to the specific test case meant to check that deckdeal is correctly implemented though the adt may be correctly implemented for the individual behavior each of those test cases is designed to test for they will each return false
student,for the second shuffle should the hand and bankroll be printed before the shuffling output or after for example should it read hand 8 bankroll 20 shuffling at or shuffling at hand 8 bankroll 20
student,so i know that we should make many many test files but do we have to make separate files for different tests of the same function for example if we wanted to test to make sure that shuffle works for n 0 52 26 13 and 39 would we need to make 5 separate files or could we do these all in one file
student,for playerfactory can we assume that it is implemented correctly to use for player tests
student,my competitor is a derived class of counting player one of my competitor methods relies on knowing what count is but this is not easily done since count is a private member of the counting player class is one solution around this to make competitor a friend class of counting class
student,im not sure if this is actually suppose to happen but is there suppose to be that much space between cuts
student,when i try to run a diff against my output with blackjackoutcorrect it says there is no file directory can anyone direct me on how to fix this problem thanks
student,and why is there a fox in lab11
student,in the case we add cards in the following order 1 ace 2 ace 3 ten 22 or 12 or even 1 ace 2 ace 3 ace 4 nine 23 or 12 are we supposed to count all the aces as 1s how can we do this when we dont really know the previous cards added to the hand since the first two aces made the hand a hard count and we have adujsted for the value once thanks for any help
student,if we implement all of our class member functions inline within the class declarations rather than outside the class declarations is this considered bad style and something we would lose points for
student,hi if i want a regrade on project 3 do i send an email to eecs 280 staff or eecs280graders
student,will our test files be graded for readability and documentation or just whether or not they can identify bugs should we comment them throughout and use rme clauses on any functions we declare inside of them
student,ok really really quick point i have a specific problem in running one of my test cases my dealer wont pick up an extra card and it results from an error in the valuation of an ace my assumption was that as long as you are under 21 with 11 added to your total you will treat an ace as soft in the test case the dealer first receives an ace so given that as the first card and the statement above this should be 11 then he gets a three 14 then he gets a jack 24 bust this is the incorrect output i have in my code the correct logic is ace 1 three 3 jack 10 eight 8 22 can someone explain the strategy for making things hard soft in this context sorry if this is somewhat similar to other questions i feel its specific enough to ask another
student,quick question i apologize if this is hit in prior posts does the dealer abide by the same hardsoft strategy with aces as the player or does he just treat everything as soft im getting some funky stuff with the dealer is why i ask
student,do we need to cout player wins after we cout player dealt natural 21 or the hand simply ends
student,hi i have been trying to debug my blackjack and it has been working and then stopping at a segfault somewhere within the program but then it seems that i fixed the things giving me the seg falut now when i try and run the program using the code given or using gdb the program just stops before a certain function and refuses to quit continue or respond in any other way ive tried putting breakpoints at and before the function that it stops at and gdb doesnt seems to register it maybe because the library needs to load before setting break points any thoughts on how to proceed
student,are we supposed to utilize static helper functions in blackjack or is it okay to just put everything in int main
student,can we include algorithm to use min function in deckcpp
student,if were adding an ace to the handvalue are we supposed to determine whether the ace is going to be counted as soft or hard in the addcard function i would assume so because otherwise you cant alter the value private member function im just a bit confused about where i should determine whether the best hand is soft or hard is it advantageous to keep the cards dealt to the player and dealer in an array in blackjackcpp so that we can check whether or not they received an ace thanks im just really confused
student,my simple player ends up with a higher bankroll than my counting player in most simulations i run has anyone else experienced this and does it certainly mean i have a bug
student,should we include test result or how the test works in overview file or simply the filename and what function it tests
student,im pretty sure this is an ok question to be asking say i run a game of a couple hundred hands for simple and counting player should i expect them to run out of bankroll at some point
student,while writing test cases for deck test can we assume that randcpp will be included in at least one of the tests
student,i have a seg fault when i try to assign argv1 to an integer bankroll can i not treat argv1 as an integer
student,if a player has two aces in hand will this situation count as hard or soft
student,im trying to debug my blackjackcpp currently but i keep getting an error every time i try to access a player member function for example const char player argv3 player p playerfactoryplayer pshuffled this chunk of code gives me the error blackjackcpp31 error request for member ‘shuffled’ in ‘p’ which is of nonclass type ‘player’ any help or hints
student,im confused how to declare a pointer to each strategy i am getting this error when i try to compile i tried declaring using simple simp but i dont know if thats right
student,if my competitor out lasts my counting class with 100 bankroll counting will last 107 hands competitor will last 231 hands would this be considered better performance
student,when writing test cases for playercpp how exactly are we supposed to test shuffled or is it really necessary to test it at all all it does is change our count variable that we cant directly reference in our test file because we created a member variable that i believe we cant assume their playercpp has
student,if the player has a natural 21 should we still output players total is 21
student,what does the note implies i thought that shuffle cuts the deck and then sets the next pointer to the first card in the deck is this wrong is next suppose to point at something else
student,should we put the declarations of the three player classes in playerh or playercpp the way i have it right now im declaring all three classes right underneath the abstract player class in playerh but my function implementations all appear in playercpp should i move the declarations to playercpp as well
student,the spec sheet said minor differences in strategy how minor can these strategy be my own strategy will only be noticed after about 20 hands would that be different enough like from changing a bound in say draw or bet to writing entirely new functions and making new variables where would the size of the difference stand
student,where to find the google doc of p4 partner registration form
student,i know the player gets a 3 to 2 return if dealt a natural 21 i know the player gets a 3 to 2 return if a push tie occurs however i cannot locate anywhere in the spec as to what happens when a player gets a nonnatural 21 and wins rather than ties
student,at the end of all my test cases i put the statement cout playertest passedn before return 0 so when i modified my makefile to run all my test cases automatically with the command make test i can see whether or not each case passed i realize without that if i saw nothing returned it would mean pass i was wondering should i delete all those couts before turning in the project and its components will it have any affect on the autograder
student,so for other than our counting class and possibly our competitor class aka the simple class these derived classes really dont have private member data that we need to initialize to me it seems that the constructor for simple would just be simple but that almost seems too easy
student,in effects of expose it says note not all cards dealt are exposedif the player goes over 21 or is dealt a natural 21 the dealer need not expose his hole card do we have to taking care of this part in the expose function can i write it in blackjack
student,my program is giving me a compile error saying that i have undefined reference to getcut i cant figure why this is showing up since ive included randh
student,to what extent are they necessary and can we use the rmes from the header filers for some of them
student,where can i find the partner registration form for project 4
student,in blackjackcpp i include 2 static void helper functions the functions are listed here in blackjackcpp i have a struct called dealer which contains the dealers hand as well as other variables related to the dealer static void dealcardtoplayerconst card c dealer d player p hand h const char type add card c to hand h call expose and then print out card c and static void dealcardtodealerconst card c dealer d player p const char type add card c to dhand calls expose and then prints out card c whenever either of these functions are called i get a compile error that says error taking address of temporary i cant figure out why this error would be showing up especially in a void function what could be going wrong
student,when writing your public functions for the simple player do you need to include the word virtual ie should it be virtual int betunsigned int bankroll unsigned int minumum or int betunsigned int bankroll unsigned int minumum
student,is the use of continue allowed to break to the beginning of loops
student,so i made my counting player inherit from simple so i could use the same draw strategy but its telling me i have an undefined reference to counting players draw function when i do this what exactly am i suppose to have in the counting players draw definition
student,im trying to debug my program by printing out member variables in my player pointer however when i deference my player pointer it prints out an address what should i type in to get gdb to print out values that arent addresses
student,im working on my test cases for playercpp and am getting a frustrating compiler error when i call the draw function it doesnt compile and says no matching function for call to playerdrawcard hand and says that draw requires card const hand however when i call draw from my player test file i give it this input card hand i cant figure out why this wouldnt work how come you cant pass the address of a hand to a function that takes a constant hand by reference input in playercpp is const hand player
student,i am writing some test for the counting player right now and i was wondering if i have to account for any bugs that could occur from misreading the required clauses in one of the h files for example in playerh one of the requirements for bet is that the bankroll is greater than or equal to the minimum should we make a test case to make sure the entered bankroll satisfies the required clause thanks
student,when testing it say we have to submit deck tests and counting player tests does that mean we should not submit any simple or competitor tests
student,how should we format the 2 overview files do we do behavior 0 bla bla bla behavior 1 bla bla bla decktest00cpp decktest01cpp
student,are we going to be graded on the amount of helper functions we have in the driver because in euchre we were
student,i think i am sorely misunderstanding the function expose and its purpose so it is a member function of all players so in essence each player has the ability to expose a card i just think the way that this project is structured is extremely frustrating why would we not give players their own hand data member variables and bank rolls i dont think it makes a lick of sense to keep it outside in the main driver program that just seems like poor confusing style and code organization to me anyway the driver needs to deal four cards initially 2 face up aka exposed to the player and 1 face up exposed and 1 face down to the dealer should we deal 4 cards to an array in the main driver then expose them accordingly or what because i would expose them from the deck as needed but the only problem is is that not all cards always are exposed sometimes the dealers holed card is not exposed so confusing
student,okay so maybe my logic is way off for this function but i thought of making 2 for loops one from 0 to 12 and the other from 0 to 3 and assigning a card for every loop through totaling 52 cards but i cant do this because rank is a private member variable any help
student,sorry if this question was posted before or if im completely misunderstanding it if a hand has two aces one of them would be 11 and the other would be 1 so what would handissoft return
student,this may be a dumb question but can somebody please explain how shuffling works i thought i had understood it correctly but it didnt work when i tested my code the h header only explains to a certain extent specifically the first step when you cut the deck that just means you simply pick up the top n cards right and you dont make an inverted pile of them by picking them off one by one then you pick off a card each from the right cut and the left cut and make a partially new deck from itso the top card from the right deck becomes the bottom card from the new pile right finally filling in the remainderdoes that mean you just plop the rest of the cards back onto the new pile or do you one by pick off the top card from the rest and place it onto the top of the new pile
student,sorry if this has already been asked but in the spec it says we should submit decktest00cpp decktest01cpp decktestnncpp and same for playertest but decktest00 and playertest00 were included in the files we were given so should we submit those or create our own decktest00 or just start at decktest01
student,im having a problem with my shuffle function and i cant debug the rest of my game without getting through this first when i shuffle my deck it cuts properly at the first cut but afterwards it starts changing cards in my deck to the two of spades so that after 2 or 3 cuts my entire deck is all two of spades i checked my deck shuffle function and im not sure what exactly is the problem can anyone clarify
student,so when we write the default constructors for players simple counting and competitor since each player has a hand of cards aka a private member data of type hand and a bankroll private member data of type int im a bit confused about what exactly we have to and dont have to do i know to initialize a private int member data is easy simple bankroll0 but the hand object has me a little confused when we give the simple class an object of type hand in the private data section my understanding is that the default constructor runs and a basic hand object is created so it follows that in the default constructor for a derived class we dont need to touch object member data since they have their own default constructor so basically simple bankroll0 would be sufficient for the default constructor additionally lets say we inherit the simple class into the counting class this means that an object of type counting will inherit private member data int bankroll and hand hand since every player no matter what strategy her she decides to follow has a bankroll and a hand but as mentioned in earlier piazza posts we need to add an additional private member variable for the count part in counting so i know that in the default constructor for counting we need to set the variable responsible for counting to 0 what i am fuzzy about is whether or not i need to also initialize the other inherited private member data since the need to set the new counting member to 0 kind of interferes with the other old inherited private member data bankroll and hand do you see my dilemma i was thinking that this should be ok counting count0 but if adding in this new count variable will interfere with the automatic running of the inherited constructor of simple i was thinking i might have to do counting bankroll0 count0 instead thoughts thanks in advance
student,so im working on cleaning up the code in the main driver file and im trying to implement some helper functions to do so however ive been having lots of difficulty passing the pointer to the player to these helper functions ive tried it a few different ways and i keep getting the compile error cannot allocate an object of abstract type player since player has pure virtual functions ive also experimented with function templating to try to pass the player pointer through but nothing has worked so far does anybody have any suggestions for passing a class to a helper function thanks in advance for the help
student,im getting an expected expression warning in my handvalue but i dont know why heres a screenshot
student,all the spec page said is that an ace will be hard or soft depending on whichever is more advantageous my question is what would the value of an ace be in different scenarios below 1 hand has ace and two 2 hand has ace and ace 3 hand has ace and seven and ace
student,so i have been typing the whole g pedantic walletc into the terminal to compile and test blackjackcpp but is there a way to compile the blackjack file with just make blackjack or something
student,is anyone else removing the randh portion of their code to test the blackjack outputs against the correct test case given to us if we dont remove it wont we always get random cuts that are different from that in the test case wont this make testing our code a pain
student,player dealt king of clubs dealer dealt queen of clubs player dealt ace of spades player dealt natural 21 players total is 21 dealers hole card is king of diamonds dealers total is 20 player wins hand 12 bankroll 47 is the portion enclosed in the angled brackets necessary
student,initially we deal 4 cards 2 to player and 2 to dealer if the player is never exposed to the dealers down card does the deck still decrease by a minimum of 4 cards from 52 48 cards i understand that the player will not change his own count of the deck2 1 etc but does the down card affect how many cards we have left in the deck and when we need to call shuffle deck count 20
student,should we write test cases to ensure the program crashes if you pass in a negative number or a number greater than 52 for shuffling im leaning toward no because if it crashes that means you identified a bug which isnt true also 052 is part of the requires clause thanks
student,can we add member functions to counting and competitor i want to add a getter to counting for testing purposes i received this error when i added my getter to counting class player has no member named getcount i understand somewhat why this wont work the case when argv3 is simple but how can i check count if it is private without a getter
student,hi my partner and i submitted the exact same cpp files for project 3 however i received 3 points lower than him these 3 points were not in the autograder component but rather the style component what is the eecs 280 policy on discrepancies between partners for projects i understand that the eecs department works hard to avoid these confusions and standardize the style guidelines and am wondering if i can receive the 3 points that my partner did this was the policy in 183 however i dont want to risk my partners grade and have him receive my grade how can this problem be handled thank you
student,do we announce shuffling the deckn and the cut anytime we shuffle or just for the first 7 shuffles
student,my partner and i tried to create a static function to check the count of the counting player but it was not part of the player class so we ran into issues when running the test file how can we test the results of the expose function without using other member functions
student,the project spec says that when a player has a hard count if his hand totals 11 or less then he should hit but it seems to me that it would be impossible for a player to have both a hard count ace counts as a 1 and a total of 11 or less this would mean that the hand total is between 1 and 10 without the soft ace but this means that that hard ace could more advantageously be counted as a soft 11 without the player busting im asking because im trying to come up with a test case to test this behavior but i cant figure out a hand that would lead to the behavior being required
student,at the beginning of my blackjack game i call rand and shuffle 7 times each time i call blackjack number number simple counting competitive the same 7 numbers are randomly generated even if i recompile shuffling the deck cut at 39 cut at 22 cut at 33 cut at 37 cut at 38 cut at 37 cut at 38 is there a problem with randcpp or the way im using it
student,say player value is 19 dealer up card ten of hearts dealer hole card seven of hearts does dealer lose or will dealer hit to try and win
student,what are we supposed to do if the command line is inputed incorrectly is there an error message were supposed to print
student,do shuffle0 and shuffle52 result in the same new deck or does one of these reverse the cards ie when the deck is cut entirely into the left group or the right group does the deck not really shuffle effects cut the deck into two segments the first n cards called the left and the rest called the right note that either right or left might be empty then rearrange the deck to be the first card of the right then the first card of the left the 2nd of right the 2nd of left and so on once one side is exhausted fill in the remainder of the deck with the cards remaining in the other side
student,do we return doublemin or bankroll if count is greater than two or if count is greater than or equal to two
student,i am narrating my understanding of how grades for test cases in this project work i am not sure if my understanding is correct or not so if i am wrong in any of these statements please let me know we have to submit test cases for deck and player any test case that calls a correct implementation buggy is thrown out and we lose points as a result so lets pretend i write separate test cases for two independent behaviors ex deck cards are in correct order after shuffling and shuffling is off by one if the shuffling off by one test case is called on a buggy implementation of shuffle that only puts the decks cards in the wrong order test case tests a behavior that is different from bug but correctly avoids the off by one error then this test case will be successfuland i assume we wont lose points for it thus we will only lose points if an absolutely perfect deckcpp for example is called buggy in any of our submitted test cases right this follows with the question what if we somehow provide a bunch of test cases that are irrelevant to what the buggy libraries do and all of the buggy libraries are determined to be correct do we gain points or lose points is our primary goal to catch the maximum number of errors that we can think of so that any of our test cases catches a buggy library or to do our best to make sure that the test cases we submit dont mark correct implementations as buggy
student,im having a little trouble with my player factory function i create an instance of each of the players using static now in my function when i try to return the value of either the simple counting or competitor instances it gives me an error it says that i cannot initialize return object of player to rvalue of type simple since simple is derived from player shouldnt this be legal
student,i have seg fault when my deck object goes out of scope int main deck d dshuffle20 return 0 this program will simply report seg fault when the main function ends im sure it is not the shuffle that cause the segfault what happen thanks
student,ive implemented the counting class to inherit from the simple class and the competitor class to inherit from the counting class in my playercpp implementation as shown below but for some reason the competitor player is inheriting functions from the simple player rather than the counting player for example the shuffled function doesnt do anything in the simple class but modifies a private member variable in the counting class when i try to call shuffled with the competitor player instead of doing what it does for the counting player it does nothing can anyone think of a reason for why this is happening class simple public player virtual void shuffled class counting public simple virtual void shuffled do something class competitor public counting no implementation for shuffled
student,im a graduating senior who wants to continue learning cs after graduation does anyone have any advice on how to best continue learning cs outside of u of m books online courses etc my goal is to build an ios app however im not sure if im ready for objective c any recommendations on where to go to pickup where we left off in eecs 280
student,i curious whether or not i could add card print function in my cardcpp to print out card or i have to write my own function in blackjackcpp
student,when testing my deckcpp i get this error when i step through the code i realize that the error comes after all the code is done and all the outputs are correct i also emailed my partner the code to run it on her xcode and she did not get this error any ideas on what error memory read failed for 0x0 means thanks
student,is the minimum bet always 5 i dont see it on the command line
student,im working out a bug on my cardsremaining function and i was hoping that i could get some tips when i subtract the pointer for the first card in the deck from the next pointer i get a negative number this is weird because i only increment next in other functions and first card pointer is never touched so next pointer should always be equal to or greater than first card pointer right what seems strange to me is that my deal function which uses the next pointer works perfectly which leads me to think that next pointer should not be giving me any trouble in the cardsremaining function ive taken a look at a few of the other threads on cardsremaining and im quite sure im on the right track as far as coding strategy goes but im not sure where my problem lies any tips
student,for conducting tests for counting player do we use the player factory function or can we just declare a counting object
student,just to clarify based on my interpretation of the project spec we only use counting player when writing tests for playercpp
student,i wrote reset function but i havent found anywhere i could use it in this project anyone knows where to use this func
student,find it closed now
student,re 1287 if the inputs to the program are such that the initial bankroll is less than the minimum bet i know the program should still shuffle and output as such do we then output that the player has his bankroll after 0 hands or just output the shuffle and then kill the program
student,so i am really struggling to understand the hand adt 1 is the hand class describing an array or just one card such as where am i adding cards to in addcard card c awhat does it mean when in handissoft effect it says return true if and only if at least one ace is present 2 i think someone may have asked this but what exactly is an empty hand or are we suppose to figure it out our self
student,i just had a quick question about how the counting player is supposed to act during the game i understand that counting alters the way the player bets based on the card count but i was wondering if there is any specific way that counting alters the way the player decides to hit or stand based on the card count the spec seemed vague and seemed to hint at altering how to decide to hit or stand but there are no exact guidelines as there was for simple do we decide how to alter the strategy for if counting hits or stands or do we not alter the strategy that is given for wether to hit or stand in simple
student,hi am i allowed to create additional member functions for the derived player classes ie a function in the counting class to assist with card counting thanks in advance
student,once an ace is turned over and counted as either soft or hard is it permanently counted this way so if an ace is counted as an 11 initially but later it would be more beneficial to count it as a 1 is the player allowed to change it back to a 1
student,i understand that virtual functions may or may not be overridden if derived and abstract functions must be overridden but then why do we set the print function in polymorphismcpp to be virtual shouldnt it just be abstract since it is overridden every time
student,according to the pdf an ace is worth either 1 or 11 whichever is more advantageous to the player what exactly is this threshold of the ace going from being worth 11 to being worth 1 is it solely when the value of the hand the value of the latest card added to it is greater than or equal to 21 is it some lesser number i dont know
student,say the dealer is dealt an ace and his hole card is a four his total would now be 15 he is then dealt two more aces would his hand total now be 17 counting one ace as an 11 and the other two as 1s in which case he would stop receiving more cards or 7counting all of his aces as 1s and keep receiving cards
student,hi i was just wondering whether it mattered what we named our classes so long as our player factory returns the correct reference static declaration of the specific class that was asked for for example would it be fine if i named my classes just simple counting and competitor
student,
student,what exactly does shuffled do the rmes explanation is really confusing is it suppose to cout a message if it has been shuffled and how does one check for if it has been shuffled or not
student,are we supposed to use the same algorithms for the draw function for the counting player as the simple player or are there other rules i cant find anything in the spec
student,if a player enters a negative number into the command line should there be an error that is printed also does the same happen for hands should there be any error checking in general from the command line
student,should we see a general trend of the counting player performing better than the simple player i am currently seeing the opposite trend which concerns me slightly thanks
student,i am working locally if that makes a difference not sure whats going on since this error has nothing to do without the big three thanks intvectorlab10cpp1336 error addition of default argument on redeclaration makes this constructor a default constructor arrayintvectorarrayintvectorint initcapacity defaultdatacapacity intvectorlab10h553 note previous declaration is here arrayintvectorint initcapacity
student,i defined the following helper variables in cardcpp const char suitnames const int suitsize const char ranknames const int ranksize since the spec says that each file must be able to run on its own i defined the suitsize and ranksize again in deckcpp when i make decktest00 it says that i have multiple definition of those variables which makes sense because i do how do i make the deckcpp file work on its own without redefining the variables
student,inside of my player cpp i compared cards by using cardranktwo for example and in terminal i get this error playercpp in member function ‘virtual bool simpledrawcard const hand’ playercpp19 error ‘cardrank’ is not a class or namespace playercpp in member function ‘virtual void countingexposecard’ playercpp61 error ‘cardrank’ is not a class or namespace it runs in xcode but not in there terminal anyone have any advice of how i should fix this
student,for the addcard function 1 if we have value 19 the hand is hard card c we would like to add has rank 5 will we still add the card to the hand even though the value will be over 21 2 similarly if we have value 21 the hand is hard card c we would like to add is ace will we count the ace as 1 and add it to value thanks
student,im confused as to how i can write tests for the counting player when testing for bet and expose function assuming i wrote a private data member in my counting player class how can i write tests that assume that the auto grader has the same data member same idea with my expose function it also is dependent on my count private data member
student,are we allowed to declare new member variablesfunctions in the derived classes im finding conflicting statements on piazze
student,if the inputs to the program are such that the initial bankroll is less than the minimum bet i know the program should still shuffle and output as such do we then output that the player has his bankroll after 0 hands or just output the shuffle and then kill the program can an instructor please comment on this
student,how do i convert the enum in rank and suit to actual strings last project we had a string array which had all the strings needed in it but this one its not included can i just make an array of my own in cardcpp
student,so i made two const char array at the top of my cardcpp file to help me with my ostream operator the only place i even call this is in the implementation of that operator now when i compile my cardcpp this is displayed cardcpp5 error too many initializers for const char cardcpp6 error too many initializers for const char what does this mean any hint on how to fix it
student,is the impltestoverview file a text filetxt
student,since the cpp files will be tested separately do i need to put the definition in every file or i can only use the overloaded output operator in cardcpp
student,heres some output from my latest tests of one of the players im working on shuffling the deck cut at 39 cut at 22 cut at 33 cut at 37 cut at 38 cut at 37 cut at 38 hand 1 bankroll 100 player bets 100 player dealt king of spades dealer dealt three of diamonds player dealt ace of clubs player dealt natural 21 hand 2 bankroll 250 player bets 250 player dealt ten of hearts dealer dealt king of hearts player dealt ace of spades player dealt natural 21 hand 3 bankroll 625 player bets 625 player dealt jack of spades dealer dealt three of clubs player dealt ace of diamonds player dealt natural 21 hand 4 bankroll 1562 player bets 1562 player dealt jack of hearts dealer dealt nine of spades player dealt ace of hearts player dealt natural 21 hand 5 bankroll 3905 player bets 3905 player dealt jack of diamonds dealer dealt six of diamonds player dealt ace of clubs player dealt natural 21 hand 6 bankroll 9762 player bets 9762 player dealt queen of hearts dealer dealt two of spades player dealt ace of spades player dealt natural 21 hand 7 bankroll 24405 player bets 24405 player dealt king of diamonds dealer dealt five of clubs player dealt ace of diamonds player dealt natural 21 hand 8 bankroll 61012 player bets 61012 player dealt queen of diamonds dealer dealt four of clubs player dealt ace of hearts player dealt natural 21 hand 9 bankroll 152530 player bets 152530 player dealt ten of clubs dealer dealt eight of hearts player dealt ace of clubs player dealt natural 21 hand 10 bankroll 381325 shuffling the deck cut at 23 cut at 23 cut at 22 cut at 39 cut at 33 cut at 19 cut at 25 player bets 381325 player dealt jack of spades dealer dealt six of diamonds player dealt ace of spades player dealt natural 21 hand 11 bankroll 953312 player bets 953312 player dealt ten of clubs dealer dealt nine of diamonds player dealt ace of clubs player dealt natural 21 hand 12 bankroll 2383280 player bets 2383280 player dealt jack of clubs dealer dealt four of diamonds player dealt ace of hearts player dealt natural 21 hand 13 bankroll 5958200 player bets 5958200 player dealt queen of hearts dealer dealt four of spades player dealt ace of diamonds player dealt natural 21 hand 14 bankroll 14895500 player bets 14895500 player dealt queen of diamonds dealer dealt two of hearts player dealt ace of spades player dealt natural 21 hand 15 bankroll 37238750 player bets 37238750 player dealt queen of clubs dealer dealt six of spades player dealt ace of clubs player dealt natural 21 hand 16 bankroll 93096875 player bets 93096875 player dealt jack of hearts dealer dealt two of diamonds player dealt ace of hearts player dealt natural 21 hand 17 bankroll 232742187 player bets 232742187 player dealt ten of diamonds dealer dealt six of hearts player dealt ace of diamonds player dealt natural 21 hand 18 bankroll 581855467 player bets 581855467 player dealt king of diamonds dealer dealt four of clubs player dealt ace of spades player dealt natural 21 hand 19 bankroll 1454638667 shuffling the deck cut at 23 cut at 24 cut at 31 cut at 22 cut at 27 cut at 34 cut at 30 player bets 1454638667 player dealt king of diamonds dealer dealt nine of diamonds player dealt ace of diamonds player dealt natural 21 hand 20 bankroll 1489113019 player bets 1489113019 player dealt jack of clubs dealer dealt nine of spades player dealt ace of spades player dealt natural 21 hand 21 bankroll 1575298899 player bets 1575298899 player dealt king of spades dealer dealt five of hearts player dealt ace of hearts player dealt natural 21 hand 22 bankroll 1790763599 player bets 1790763599 player dealt ten of hearts dealer dealt four of hearts player dealt ace of clubs player dealt natural 21 hand 23 bankroll 2329425349 player bets 1965541947 player dealt queen of spades dealer dealt six of hearts player dealt ace of diamonds player dealt natural 21 player has 1528596077 after 23 hands i think that its odd that playerbet takes in two unsigned ints for the bankroll and minimum bet and returns a signed int for the players bet since it seems like the player should never be allowed to make a negative bet and because a player may run out of numbers as happens above is there any reason for the function returning a signed int instead of an unsigned one yes the algorithm my player uses is a rather unconventional one no im sure drawing nine consecutive natural 21s between shuffles is fairly normal if youre playing with the right sort of people
student,is there a difference in the difficulty breadth and scope of the course if we take it in the spring im wondering because the spring term seems to be much shorter will the total amount of content taught be the same with the same amount of rigor
student,so for the counting class is the count suppose to be a private or global variable or something similar also for the competitor class how much variation would i need from counting and simple if i chose to make another counting strategy base off the counting class one with slight deviations would that be allowed
student,ive thought about this for a while now and after some research i still dont understand the answer when you overload an assignment operator i understand why you need to return an address but what i dont understand is why do you do return this rather than return this i thought that this would returned a dereferenced pointer which i thought would return the object and i thought returning this give the address that this is pointing too but clearly this is not the case and when you try return this you get a compile error could someone please explain this to me
student,i know that were supposed to output the cards dealt at the beginning of a hand but when the player hits or dealer hits should we also output player dealt rank of suit for each hit
student,do we have to produce any output if theres a commandline error for example if someone enters too many arguments at the command line or if someone enters a random string for the playertype argument also do we crash the program like in euchre with exitexitfailure
student,i keep getting this error when trying to compile my player factory function playercpp26 error expected initializer before ‘’ token why am i getting this line 26 is player playerfactoryconst char s so i dont know why thats happening
student,when will submit280 be up for project 4

student,should we refrain from giving our competitor class superhuman abilities
student,if there is one card remaining in the deck and that card is then dealt what should the next pointer point to i havent seen this clarified anywhere in the spec but maybe im overlooking something thanks
student,according to todays lecture it seems like the enclosing class can not access its nested class thus we use friends to deal with it but how about the other way around
student,in my counting player i have a private int called count my expose function attempts to manipulate this value by count and count i am getting an error saying int countingcount is private followed by error within context on every line i try to modify count shouldnt i be able to modify count like this
student,do we declare the derived classes simple player counting player and competitive player in playerh like how the derived classes for shape were declared in shapeh in lab 7 if not where are they declared
student,is it safe to declare extra helper functions within our implementation of the player counting class and the player competitor class
student,just to clarify we can work in partners for the test cases correct
student,spec if shuffle is called on a deck that has already had some cards dealt those cards should first be restored to the deck in the order in which they were dealt preserving the most recent postshuffledpostreset state so if we cut the deck at 26 and call shuffle again after dealing is the top card of the reset deck a two of spades or whatever the 26th card is the first card dealt in the previous shuffle
student,i have a question about the implementation of abstract classes for example i want to use the draw in every classes so i implemented the draw in player then what should i put in the simple just a blank brackets like virtual bool drawcard dealer const hand player or what should i write thanks
student,are there overall class stats for p3
student,in the spec it says simple does nothing for expose and shuffled does that mean we just dont include those functions in the implementation of simple also if counter and simple use the same strategy for draw is there a way for me to call the draw in simple for counter so that i dont just write the same function twice thanks
student,ive created the implementation for the files that are in cardh and each time i try and compile it the complier gives me an error saying that suit and rank are not defined as a type i have included cardh and tried using initializer syntax and regular syntax as it is for example the constructor is card card code any thoughts on what could be going awry
student,i have a question regarding the output of the blackjackcpp should the players total be printed after each dealt card or after the player standsbusts in the sample output the player never drew a card after the initial two cards so when should the total be printed if the player does draw more cards afterward
student,ive implemented my cardcpp file and ive implemented the operator overload in the cardh file but now when i try to test cardcpp i get this error message im doing this locally on xcode any ideas screenshot20140403at14658pmpng
student,im testing my blackjack driver and am getting a segfault in my shuffle function whenever i use make blackjack which includes the o1 tag when i compile it for debugging with g instead of o1 it runs through the program completely and does not segfault any idea why this may be happening
student,im confused on how to implement the player function specifically when the spec says you must also declare a static global instance of each of the three players in playercpp what exactly does this mean and what is it for are they supposed to be used as pointers for the player factory function to return i tried putting static simple simple static counting counter static competitor competitor at the beginning of playercpp and then returning one of these in factory function based on the input strong but this didnt work error expected initializer before ‘’ token
student,could somebody please clarify what a static global instance is im trying to write my factory function
student,im trying to test my simple player and the following code causes a segfault player p playerfactorysimple pbet5 5 through some simple tests i realized the bet function isnt even being entered any insight into why this is happening
student,in the effect clause of the handvalue function it says returns the present value of the blackjack hand the highest blackjack total possible without going over 21 if the hand is over 21 any value over 21 may be returned if my hand is over 21 according to the spec does it means that i will return value 21 or return value
student,if the result is not an integer are we rounding up or rounding down
student,is the coding for reset the same as deck since they both create a newly open pack
student,is it ok if i implemented my member functions directly in the class declaration
student,can i derive counting from simple or do i need to do so from player i feel that doing so would make it easier and cleaner since as far as i can tell they would use the same draw function and the things that differ can be easily dealt with because of polymorphism
student,which of the following is a correct function definition for copyall in a linked list class and why templatetypename t void listtcopyallconst list l stuff templatetypename t void listtcopyallconst listt l stuff
student,is it necessary to to have a hand private member variable in our derived classes i ask because the draw function asks for a hand variable as an input but in our blackjackcpp there is no way we can access a private variable from our player class
student,were allowed to write code as partners on the actual implementations not just the test cases right and do we still need to include both our uniqnames at the top of every file what about the test cases
student,is it ok if i declare these const variables in my cardcpp for the suit and rank names const char suitnames const char ranknames or do i have to make them static also static const char suitnames static const char ranknames
student,should we assume that the deck will always be shuffled once and so shuffled will always be executed at least once or will that lead to problems and docked points
student,do we have to follow a specific naming convention for our 3 derived player classes or can we call the classes pretty much what we want
student,in the static global instances of countingplayer simpleplayer and competitior does the player destructor declaration need to be written in the public parts also is there anything else to making these classes static other than starting their declarations with static class class name public player
student,my partner and i have different ideas of what the overview files for the tests should comprise of and i was wondering if there could be a clarification on that i just put a small paragraph in each of them describing what the adt should be doing whereas she put in a small description followed by a list of the test cases and what each of them test for an instructor response would be much appreciated
student,is it possible to declare a class without any member variables i cant think of any reason to include member variables in the simple player adt but im not sure how to create the constructor or if one is necessary but if there are no member variables is there a point to creating a class
student,for deckdeal are we suppose to decrease the deck size when you deal a card if so how since decksize is const
student,when a player receives a natural 21 we print out player dealt natural 21n in replace of players total is pcount endl correct
student,is the counting players draw strategy any different from the simple players as far as i can tell theres no difference
student,if i want to overload the expose function in my competitor but give it one additional argument is that okay
student,im writing counting player right now and i am a little confused by the spec is shuffled suppose to do anything other than set the count member variable back to 0 im not sure if it is called when the deck is shuffled or i need to decide if the deck was shuffled in the function i would assume it is only called after the deck was shuffled thanks
student,for the player counting cards is count initialized at 0
student,in our player program counting is derived from simple the simple function works fine however when we try to test counting the counting virtual functions are not being used but the simple ones are instead how do we fix this
student,i know there have been a lot of questions about this so i hope my question is a bit different i understand that when the deck has less than 20 cards we shuffle heres the situation the player is in the middle of his turn and keeps hitting in the process of the player hitting the deck becomes less than 20 cards do we shuffle in the middle of the players turn in coding terms should we check before we deal a card for either the player or dealer whether or not there are less than 20 cards in the deck and if so shuffle furthermore im assuming we should at least shuffle between the player and dealers turn if there are less than 20 cards in the deck
student,is there a way to include bankroll as a member variable in the derived classes so this data is included with the player object we need to have the command line arguments determine which type of player will be used in blackjackcpp and for that we must call the playerfactory function even if you both include a constructor in each of the derived class to initialize the member variables and you include bankroll inside the derived classes you will not be able to keep the object you initialize with these values the third command line argument needs to define which type of player you will use and so you must call playerfactory which will return a pointer to a static implementation of each derived class in playercpp these static implementations dont have access to the command line arguments and so you cannot initialize them with any value for bankroll as determined by the first command line argument when you use this return value to assign a player you declare in blackjackcpp its dynamic type you must overwrite that object do we have to declare bankroll as an integer in blackjackcpp and monitor it it seems inefficient and not it keeping with the capacity classes provide for this reason
student,i compiled the test as so g pedantic wall werror o1 decktest00cpp deckcpp o decktest00 and received numerous undefined reference to errors in deckcpp and decktest00cpp eg decktest00cpp text0x166 undefined reference to cardgetrank const does this mean 1 my code is wrong 2 my way of compiling is wrong 3 both note before i received these errors i was receiving the standard deckcppline error specific reason and then fixed all of these bugs
student,where is ittttt
student,does expose change anything in the counting players hand aka does expose update the counting players hand value or just the count
student,i know for the test cases we are supposed to return 0 granted nothing goes wrong are we supposed to return anything in particular for the blackjackcpp file
student,do we need to write test cases which test draw to ensure it doesnt deviate from simples implementation
student,are the random cuts supposed to be the same for each shuffle every time we run the program what i mean is that my first seven cuts are always the same no matter how many times i run the program im guessing this is for autograding purposes
student,are we allowed to make helper functions for the driver program such as the shuffling implementation if so would we put them above main in blackjackcpp
student,just to clarify does blackjackcpp have to shuffle the card at the beginning of every hand or does it just shuffle the first time the code is called and whenever the deck is below 20 cards
student,in my blackjackcpp i have the line of code allowing the player to play his hand by drawing cards until he stands or busts whileplayerptrdrawdealer playerhand and i declare a card dealer when dealing the first four cards so that i have it to pass to draw but when i compile with the above code i am getting this error blackjackcpp97 error no matching function for call to ‘playerdrawcard hand’ the card is clearly not an address i receive it indirectly from a temp card variable that is assigned by a call deckdeal where deck is the deck object i am using it is strange
student,hey in blackjackcpp i have a hand playerhand and hand dealerhand to keep track of each however after adding cards to each hand through a deal function i have within blackjackcpp the values for each are correct but then once exiting the function these values are erased in handcpp i simply increment value in addcard am i suppose to have individual instances within hand functions thanks
student,are we allowed to add member variables to the derived classes
student,for the counting class do we need tocan we write a constructor that initializes the count to zero i wasnt sure if we could add in a constructor if it wasnt prototyped in the player class if i cant do it with a constructor how else can i initialize my member variables
student,were trying to store the bankroll from the command line into a variable and then convert it from a c string to an int with atoi however xcode doesnt like it and it keeps saying bad access address 0x0 from what ive read on stackoverflow this means i have a null pointer somewhere i dont understand how that could happen when were just trying to store something from the command line in to a variable is it something to do with atoi
student,currently my deal function returns a dereferenced next pointer and then uses the post increment operator to move next to the next card in the deck however when i call my deal function each card becomes the first card two of spades even though the deck is properly initialized example next im curious as to why this is the case and what i can do to move the pointer correctly as it is not moving now thanks
student,will our playercpp be linked against the other cpp files during unit testing if our playercpp depends on deckcpp or something is it guaranteed to be available if submit280 reports no compilation errors does that mean our cpp files compile both during testing and with the program as a whole or does it only check one or the other
student,i am having trouble testing my playercpp code in playertest00cpp in playercpp i created the derived class class simple public player insert code here in playertest00cpp im trying to create an object of simple by doing simple simplemy code wont compile when i do this it says simple’ was not declared in this scope im assuming this is because none of the functions in simple are written or declared in playerh which i include in player test they are all written and declared in playercpp when i include playercpp instead of playerh the code compiles and works but isnt it bad practice to include cpp files and im assuming it may cause problems in the autograder are we allowed to edit the given header files or is it okay to include playercpp did i go about declaring the derived class wrong thanks for the help
student,so im having trouble with printing the card names in my code as i understand it since the overload was already defined we can just say something like cout player dealt next endl to print the card xcode gives me this weird error operatorstd1basicostreamchar std1chartraitschar card const referenced from main in blackjacko i then tried compiling in caen and it gave me a bunch of errors like handcpptext0x50 undefined reference to cardgetrank const just based on these errors does anyone know what ive done wrong
student,are we to assume the dealer is of type simple player
student,bash41 g pedantic wall werror o1 o blackjackcpp deckcpp handcpp playercpp randcpp cardcpp usrlibgccx8664redhatlinux447lib64crt1o in function start text0x20 undefined reference to main collect2 ld returned 1 exit status any thoughts on what this may mean the program compiles correctly in a windows environment visual studio 2011 any help is greatly appreciated thanks
student,i know this is an easy question but im completely drawing a blank how would one convert the enums rank and suit to strings so that they may be printed im implementing the output operator in cardcpp
student,in the pdf what does it mean by be sure to tell the player that a shuffle has occurred via shuffled as far as i look at the shuffle function there is not such pointer or switch or anything indicate that we have this like true or false shuffle switch thanks
student,in the spec it says we should submit decktest00cpp should this be the given test case or should we overwrite it with our own thanks
student,ive been wrestling with this bug for the last three hours whenever i print anything to standard output my decknext pointer is being corrupted into strange broken data even when i print an unrelated cstring like player bets to standard output suddenly my decknext data becomes corrupted is there a problem with cout where it can overwrite my pointer like this
student,i noticed when i diffd the given test case that when the dealer busts you dont say that the player wins as well the same goes for when the deal busts the spec doesnt specify if you should announce player wins if they are dealt a natural 21 am i correct in thinking that you do not announce it you only announce the winners if there is no busting and one has a higher score and no natural 21s also if the dealer is dealt a natural 21 and the player manages to get 21 do they push
student,will all the test cases that we write be graded by hand for style
student,must next be incremented within the deckdeal function
student,how do you decide if the first card dealt to a playerdealer would be counted as 1 or 11 according to the sample player test it must be counted as 11 is there any way to go back and change the value of an ace is this needed to be done thanks
student,i am trying to compile my project and in the playercpp file i am getting 2 fatal errors that say 1playerobj error lnk2001 unresolved external symbol public virtual void thiscall simpleexposeclass card exposesimpleuaexvcardz 1playerobj error lnk2001 unresolved external symbol public virtual bool thiscall competitordrawclass cardclass hand const drawcompetitoruaenvcardabvhandz im confused as to what this error means and as to why it is occurring i only have the expose function for simple in the class type as expose is not needed for the simple player and thus i have not implemented anything for it my competitordraw function is for now going to be the same as the draw function for the two other players and thus i have not implemented it either is the problem that they are not implemented in any way or do i need to change something in my class implementations in my class simple expose is virtual as is draw in my class competitor any help is appreciated and thank you in advance
student,i get the error cannot declare variable ‘player’ to be of abstract type ‘simple’ because the following virtual functions are pure within ‘simple’ it seems like i am able to declare variables of type counting and competitor because i based those off of the simple class which didnt have the pure virtual functions in it but rather our implementations of the pure virtual functions from the player base class
student,if you declare virtual in the base class does it have to be declared in the child or is it assumed
student,has anyone had a problem where the terminal is only printing out question marks
student,if the player does not have an ace in his hand is the hand a hard count
student,are we supposed to implement a dealer class derived from player sorry if it was in the spec and i just missed it and if not where do we implement the dealers tactics for hitting and staying
student,will the dealer play to get to 17 or greater or will he play to get to the highest number possible for example dealer dealt seven of diamonds … dealers hole card is ace of diamonds dealers total is 18 or dealers total is 8 will he hit again to try to get a higher value then 18 or will he stand
student,if you pass a classeg deck deck not deck deck into a helper function and do some modification inside the helper function will these changes remain after you exit the helper function what im worried about is that only the copy of that class is modified in the helper function if a class is passed by value thanks
student,when i am trying to test my simple player i got an error saying that simple is not declared in this scope how to fix it any help is appreciated
student,in the hand constructor were supposed to initialize an empty hand but what exactly is an empty hand theres no variable within the class the holds an array of cards and when we add cards do we just add to the value how do we keep track of what cards we have

student,when i use datacapacity datacapacity 2 as we are instructed to do my program doesnt complete and gives me this error after calling grow a bunch of times grow was called capacity is now 1342177280 libcabidylib terminating with uncaught exception of type stdbadalloc stdbadalloc i changed the code to datacapacity datacapacity 1 as well as changing my new array to having datacapacity 1 space in the array and this worked and the code compiled and everything was correct which solution should i use
student,do we need to submit test cases for our competitor itd be pretty difficult to do as i cant be sure how exactly your competitor is set up
student,right now i have a countingplayer class that has a private member variable my competitorplayer class is derived from countingplayer and has the same private member variable i want to be able to simply call some of the countingplayers functions in competitorplayer that modify the member variable but if i do this it will only change the private member variable of countingplayer while leaving competitorplayers variable unchanged is there a way to call the same function but just have it modify competitorplayers variable
student,would the following play result in a natural 21 for the player or would it result in a bust player dealt three of clubs dealer dealt ace of spades player dealt ace of hearts player dealt eight of diamonds player dealt two of hearts player dealt queen of clubs …
student,not exactly sure how to do this one ive looked at it from a bunch of different angles like counting how many times deal has been called or looping through to the end of the pack and counting how many cards i passed but i feel like theres a simpler solution any suggestions
student,so in the handissoft im wondering what the best way to go about determining whether an ace is in the hand is considering hand only stores values not what the actual card that was received is
student,is there any way to get the pcount in blackjackcpp i have tried making a function called getcount which returns the count starting from the counting player class in playercpp and tried calling it in blackjackcpp but it says that no member named getcount was found in player i suspect its because theres no member function like getcount in the player base class which is why im not allowed to do this anyone have any ideas on how to get around this
student,i believe in the spec it says the game ends if the player has too little money to bet or the maximum number of hands have been played but what if we dont have enough cards in the deck
student,according to playerh void shuffled is supposed to tell the player that the deck has been reshuffled how does one detect if a shuffle has occurred
student,so lets say im writing test cases for the deckcpp and the test case requires the usage of cardh the instructors wouldnt be mean enough to compile my test cases with a wrongly implemented cardcpp file rightright
student,the spec says that if there are fewer than 20 cards remaining in the deck then resuffle the deck my question is do we reshuffle starting from the first card in the postshuffled deck or do we reshuffle from the first card in a newly opened deck also i noticed that in my deckcpp that i never used the reset function where is this function supposed to be used
student,im trying to make temporary arrays of cards for left and right by declaring card leftn but when i use n for the array length im getting a warning and when i go to use left it says its an int can i not use n within shuffle
student,shuffling the deck cut at 27 hand bankroll player bets 5 player dealt king of spades or hand bankroll shuffling the deck cut at 27 player bets 5 player dealt king of spades
student,are we allowed to add our own variables in private in inherited player
student,could someone help me understand how to write representation invariants for card deck and player considering we are not able to write any new private member functions like checkinvariant functions into the classes thanks
student,the last line of the rme for deckshuffle states this function produces no output page 4 of the spec states announce each of the seven cut points note this output must be generated by code in blackjackcpp not in deckshuffle cout cut at cut endl then be sure to tell the player that a shuffle has occurred via shuffled which is correct the rme or the spec
student,are the withheld midterm exams still available for pickup from prof deorios office hours
student,1 does simple player only play either hard count or soft count how do they play when theres no ace at hand 2 do i have to create a handishard function somewhere
student,i was looking back at lab08 task3 regarding using assert to check representation invariants the spec says that representation invariants should be added to beginning and end of every public member variable what is the rationale for this there are many functions in the intset class that have nothing to do with changing numelements
student,i have a question reagrding when a player has multiple aces in hisher hand heres an example player foo first card is an ace so the value of the hand is 11 and it is soft second card is an ace so the value of the hand is 12 but is it considered soft or hard third card is a ten so should the total be 22 or 12 again i am asking this because normally it would go down to 12 but it is suggested to us that we dont need more than the two variables provided to us for the hand class to function properly but if the total is supposed to be 12 i cant see how we are supposed to do this without adding another variable labeled numaces or something
student,class deck public void reset deck deck1 what is the difference between deckreset and deckreset under what circumstance should i use which of them
student,i understand that we cannot use functions defined in another cpp file but can i do this include deckh in playercpp in other to use the definition of a deck
student,the first question i have is whether it would be good style to make a h file for our blackjackcpp secondly in the same way how a new struct game was made to represent a game of euchre in our last project would you suggest we create a class for a game of blackjack this class would most likely be defined in the h file if that too is good style
student,i have a few questions 0 class hand only has value and soft so all logic for aces needs to be addressed within hand as the cards are added ie will i not be able to look back at the actual cards in the hand 1 in addcard how do we know what do add to value for the ace i am under the impression that the ace should count as 11 if the current hand value can fit an 11 without going over 21 otherwise the ace should add 1 to value is this correct 2 in handvalue is the function not supposed to just return value if what i have said in the above question is correct why wouldnt value always be the highest total possible without going over 21 any help appreciated thanks
student,when dealing the first 4 cards who is himself referring to the dealer or the player which cards go to whom from what i remember the dealer only gives himself one card not two at the beginning
student,how can we use a for loop to fill the pack or do we need to 52 lines of code to implement that cards into the deck cards0 cardcardtwo cardspades cards1 cardcardthree cardspades cards2 cardcardfour cardspades etc
student,for the deckshuffle function i try to make two arrays of cards leftn and right decksizen however it gives me an error when i try to do this telling me i cannot have a variable length array however the value of n will not change over the course of the deckshuffle function is there a better way to do this or a good fix for this error
student,will there be a minilab in discussion this week i dont see anything posted in assignments
student,are we supposed to implement the operator for cards since we just learned this it seems puzzling as to why itd be on the current project and not project 5 but if someone can clear this up thatd be much appreciated
student,just wondering because it is easier to download them to watch later that way thanks in advance
student,the function cardsremaining is supposed to return the number of cards in the deck that have not been dealt since the last resetshuffle does this include the card that the pointer next is pointing to at the moment for example if there were six cards and next is pointing to the second card would cardsremaining return 4 or 5
student,cannot get what does it mean by note if shuffle is called on a deck that has already had some cards dealt those cards should first be restored to the deck in the order in which they were dealt preserving the most recent postshuffledpostreset state this function produces no output supposing we have already dealt 6 cards and we called shuffle4 we need to first put the 6 cards back to the first six position of the card and then cut by 4 or we need to put the 6 cards in the first six position and cut the rest 46 cards by 4 by the way do we need to set the next pointer to the first card after we shuffle
student,if i cannot go to my professors office hours where can i pick up my exam
student,could someone explain to me what the this keyword does exactly
student,for the shuffle function is using dynamic arrays the only way to accomplish this
student,how can we check just one file eg cardcpp against the test case provided in this case cardtest00cpp can we use this command to test just cardcpp against cardtest00cpp g wall werror o1 pedantic cardcpp cardtest00cpp o card thank you
student,how can you access the rank and suit enums in deckcpp i tried writing cardrank two two but the compiler said that two was not in this scope thanks
student,is the exposed function just supposed to print out the name of the card to std for example ace of spades
student,can someone explain the how the exposed function and the shuffle member allow the player to see what is happening im confused as that the rme means by stating that the player can see what is happening
student,can i use a global variable in my test files
student,do we need to take ace as 11 in handvalue
student,when i am printing the values of my cards in cardcpp the enums automatically get printed as their corresponding ints for example instead of printing two of spades its printing 0 of 0 im not sure why its not returning the actual enum is there something im missing
student,g g decktest00cpp cardcpp deckcpp o decktest00 undefined symbols for architecture x8664 deckdeal referenced from main in decktest00974525o deckshuffleint referenced from main in decktest00974525o ld symbols not found for architecture x8664 clang error linker command failed with exit code 1 use v to see invocation im programming locally on a mac did all of project 3 this same way and never had this sort of error is there a specific reason for this

student,when i was trying to implement it i got an error said that rank was not declared in this scope the same for suit i really cant figure out why thanks for any help
student,how to initialize an array using initializer list
student,so when exactly is the player allowed to hit if the dealer hits until he reaches 17 or greater and does not bust whose move will it be does the dealer keep hitting or does the player jump in
student,for handissoft what are we comparing the rank of ace to are we comparing it to next in deck thank you in advanced for the help
student,if ace 1 and ace 11 both somehow causes me to bust should i still set ace 1
student,i tried compiling cardcpp and g told me that there were errors in the header file particulalry it has a problem with the rank and suit member variables telling me that cardsuit will be initialized later on line 28 of the header file does anyone know what this error mean i compiled with the c flag
student,would it be a good idea to set the initial soft value to false for the sake of the handissoft function that way the handisfalse always returns false if theres no ace if the hand has no ace is it considered hard
student,lets say i have a hand with one ace in it since i am under 21 that ace is worth 11 and the hand is soft now say i add another ace 11 11 22 so that second ace cannot have a value of 11 my question is if i switch this second ace to a 1 does my first ace have to switch to a 1 in other words do my aces have to have the same value if so does this switching have to occur in my addcard function im not sure how to keep track of both the number of aces ive added and the value ive given them
student,should i do any value updating in handvalue or should i leave all that to addcard
student,so for our players we arent given constructor functions to well construct should we be writing constructors for our players or would this fall under the dont write any more functions thing
student,whats the best way to translate the enum values of a cards rank and suit into strings i used a set of switch cases for each different rank and suit to assign a string value to variables then i just outputted those variables it seemed a bit tedious is there a more efficient way to do this or is the switch case necessary
student,if the dealers hand values greater than 17 say 18 can he continue to hit or is he done
student,what is the playerfactory function used for in what instance would we be using a player pointer as opposed to a player
student,ok so ive defined my players in playercpp and am on to writing some initial tests for them the problem is that since i wrote them completely in the cpp when i try to write tests in a testing file in which i include playerh it doesnt recognize their existence normally i would just edit the h file but were explicitly told in the spec not to edit any of the files given to us what do
student,can we assume that the commandline arguments fit the spec for example what if the user runs blackjack with the arguments blah blah blah blaaah
student,cardcpp131 error ‘rank’ does not name a type rank cardgetrank const what does this error mean happens with suit as well
student,is there a way to return the index of a pointer ie if a pointer is pointing to the 10th element in an arraysize is there a way to write the pointer so that it returns the value 10 instead of the memory address of array9 or the value at array9 const int size 52 int arraysize int p array9 return pindex would like this to return a 10 the 10th element in the array pindex is not real maybe it is i want something like it any help greatly appreciated i think this may help with cardsremaining
student,the rmes for many of the functions in the class deck say that we modify this modifies this none say that we modify the pointer next so where should we increment the pointer next in card deal
student,do we have to consider the case when the next pointer is pointing to the last element of the card array i dont think it will get to the last element for the game but the rmes didnt really specify whether to consider the case or not
student,finished my program and passed the public euchretest cases im wondering whats supposed to happen if i pass in a name longer than 1024 characters currently when i do so the first line euchre packin prints out every character but afterwards on other lines it prints out 1024 characters should this happen
student,could anyone help me with how to determine who is dealer the specs says that the first dealer is the first playerindex of 0 but who is the dealer for the next round thanks
student,when i try to compile both gamecpp and euchrecpp i get the following error and this is the only one tmpcc3o1tybo in function main euchrecpptext0x3db undefined reference to gameinitgame char const bool int char const const collect2 ld returned 1 exit status ive already finished writing the implementation of gameinit so i dont think there are any problems with thati also included gameh to both gamecpp and euchrecpp anyone know why this error occurs thanks
student,this might be a dumb question but when were doing rmes do we need to add in the rmes that already exist in the h files into our cpp files as well or do we just need to include rmes for the helper functions we create
student,screenshot20140316at41409pmpng does this mean argc should be 7 or 8
student,in the two euchre test outputs on says no shuffle and on says shuffle on the first line of code why would the gave ever begin with no shuffle thanks
student,so when i run euchre packin noshuffle 1 alice bob cathy drew which is the same command for euchretest00 i get this output everything up to the fourth and fifth trick is the same as euchretest00outcorrect however in the 4th and 5th trick alice decides to lead ten of diamonds again she led it in the 3rd trick and cathy and drew also decide to play the same cards that they did in the 3rd trick something is wrong here can someone help me please thanks
student,im a little confused on how we determine trump during round 2 i understand the order of calling trump moving one person to the left until we get to the dealer but from the spec it seems to me that as soon as the up card is determined and if everyone passes during round one then we already know what trump will become during round 2 during round two a player will order up the suit with the same color as the up card if he has one or more face cards of that suit in his hand for example if the up card was a heart and he had the king of diamonds in his hand he would order up diamonds if making reaches the dealer during the second round we invoke screw the dealer where the dealer is forced to order up in the case of screw the dealer the dealer will always order up the suit with the same color as the up card in the case given in the spec it sounds to me that even if someone has a good spades hand they will pass or say diamonds if they have a diamond face card am i just over thinking this or was this done on purpose to simplify the game
student,this is one of my helper function for gameplay static suit orderupatrumpplayer const dealer card upcard int orderupteam int playerzero dealer is an array of pointers point to players if i dont want to change the pointer but i do need to change the players card is this a right way to pass it can i write it as player const dealer what if i dont use const at all for example if i pass it as player dealer are the values of pointers going to be changed thank you
student,when i try to submit my project it says warning did not pass the endtoend noshuffle test case warning did not pass the endtoend shuffle test case what are these test cases testing for my outputs match both the published test outputs 00 and 01 so i think my shuffle is working correctly and am not sure where to fix to pass these tests thanks in advance
student,when i compile and run my program and copy and paste the output to diff it it is correct and matches however when i use the command euchre packin noshuffle 1 alice bob cathy drew euchretest00out diff ­q euchretest00out euchretest00outcorrect to try and redirect the output to a file i get the error usage euchre packfilename shufflenoshuffle pointstowin name1 name2 name3 name4 i am thinking this is because when i use the command to redirect the output the number of arguments executable is not 8 but in the specs it said that we should check that the number of arguments is exactly 7 so in my euchrecpp i wrote if argc 8 cout usage euchre packfilename shufflenoshuffle pointstowin name1 name2 name3 name4 is this not the correct way to go do it should i be worried that it doesnt redirect the correct output to another file correctly
student,when i try to submit project 3 i get this afsumicheduclasseecs280submit280 3 project 3 partner registration httpgooglgpwtxu error is not a plain file my partner and i both filled out that partner form am i doing something wrong
student,should we check to see if the user inputs a decimal value for the points to win for example if this command is run euchre packin noshuffle 152 alice bob cathy drew should the program print on the next line this euchre packin noshuffle 152 alice bob cathy drew or should it print this euchre packin noshuffle 15 alice bob cathy drew or should it print this usage euchre packfilename shufflenoshuffle pointstowin name1 name2 name3 name4 thanks in advance
student,basically the same question as httpspiazzacomclasshp2rzo7sanj9jcid1137 but with some other information when i try to submit my project it says warning did not pass the endtoend noshuffle test case warning did not pass the endtoend shuffle test case what are these test cases testing for my outputs match both the published test outputs 00 and 01 so i think my shuffle is working correctly and am not sure where to fix to pass these tests one student said it was a diff mismatch but we diffed our output against correct input and it passes that so were pretty sure its not an instructor earlier however said this im not sure where you are seeing endtoend noshuffleshuffle but i assume that they test a long game many rounds with and without shuffling so what exactly is this test case testing for shuffle or output mismatch
student,in test01 alice deals ace of diamonds turned up bob passes cathy passes drew passes alice orders up diamonds ace of spades led by bob nine of hearts played by cathy queen of hearts played by drew ace of hearts played by alice bob takes the trick why does bob take the trick the spec says that the order of suit rankings is diamonds clubs hearts spades diamond is trump so that doesnt matter but shouldnt alice win hearts are always greater than spades unless spades is trump im not sure what im misunderstanding here
student,assertcardcompareninehearts jackdiamonds acehearts clubs 0 yes or no i guess the more general question is if you have a nontrump card and a card of the lead suit that is not higher than the nontrump card would the lead suit card take precedence
student,do we need to announce the winners alphabetically is cathy and alice win the hand ok when it also means cathy and alice win the hand thank you
student,so i feel as though something is wrong with our pointer to next because our cards are always off turned up ours is ace of diamonds should be jack of diamonds our played cards go q spades 9 hearts q hearts 2 spades what should be j spades k spades a spades 9 diamonds i am not as concerned about the played cards because the turned up card is different which means there is a different trump and subsequently a different strategy but i am concerned about that orginal turned up and very concerned as to why a 2 of spades exists while that isnt in packin also i recall from the midpoint check i remember 2 of spades being printed does that have something to do with it is it possible the problem exists in some function that passed the midpoint any suggestions on where to look would be great thank you
student,so when i run my test case everything seems to be correct except they play the same hand over and over im pretty sure its because i dont discard the card im playing so my question is 1 does this seem like the correct error 2 is it easier to discard the card in gamecpp or playercpp thanks
student,i was wondering how should we prepare the final exam is reading the text book a good choice are there any online resources recommended where i can find more exercise to do thanks
student,what are some ideas on how to stress test our project 3 past the publicized test cases ive passed both but want to make sure i cover all bases thanks
student,does noshuffle mean shuffle once at the beginning of the game and never shuffle again or does it mean dont shuffle at all
student,my partner and i are running into a peculiar problem where the first reference to gameptr is changing only the content of the card referenced to by gameptrpacknext the memory location next is unchanged no cards in packcards are changed or their memory location and our code compiles in both g and xcode the only changes upon the first reference to gameptr is before after cardnextsuit spades 32767 cardnextrank nine 192122624 it should also be noted that incrementing the memory location of next does not result in ten or spades but equally random integers instead
student,im pretty sure this was addressed before but i cant find the question after a partnership makes a point do the cards get shuffled again and then dealt or rather are the cards just dealt as is with just the dealer moving around and if there is no shuffle does the pack just keep getting reset
student,we are having issues regarding finding a way how to use makeresponse in one of our gameplay helper functions in order to determine if a trump card is not ordered up currently this helper function returns a suit but we saw another post that recommended returning a makeresponse that would use bool and a trump suit parameters to see if the card is ordered up
student,why does the following code not produce a compile error despite the fact that we didnt use the new operator when we created p int main int p 0 delete p
student,can we assume that the input for points will be an integer my program currently truncates it the spec doesnt say anything about what to do about that
student,i am a little confused by the following type of situation with pointers in the program below i expected the stored address of the pointer c to be changed to that of the pointer a why does this not happen include iostream void pointtoint int ainfn int cinfn cinfn ainfn stdcout cinfn stdendl int main int a5 c10 int a a c c pointtoint a c stdcout c stdendl return 0 prints 5 instead of what i expected 5 10 5
student,i used the enum suit for my gamecpp but when i declare it the compiler tells me there has already been a declaration of the enum however when i delete the declaration in my gamecpp the compiler tells me it is not defined i checked that the enum declaration of suit is in cardcpp so gamecpp shouldnt be able to see it is there a way to solve this compiler error other than changing the name of the enum
student,imagine the upcard is diamonds everyone passes in round 1 so now people look in their hands for heart face cards if bob has jack of diamonds aka left bower for hearts and no other heart face cards will he count the jack of diamonds as a heart face card and order up
student,the project spec states that during round two a player will order up the suit with the same color as the up card if he has one or more face cards of that suit in his hand does the same color as the up card also include the same suit as the up card because they are technically the same color for example during round 2 if the card led is a king of diamonds and the player has one jack of diamonds will the player order up diamonds
student,is it assumed that the pack will always be called packin i had always put open packin but just noticed packinit allows packfilename to be different how should i account for this i previously was using the example on the lecture slides by making setting string filename packin i tried simply setting it to string filename packfilename in various ways but now i cant ever seem to open the pack anymore
student,hello if someone has this hand queen of clubs jack of spades jack of diamonds nine of clubs king of spades with the king of diamonds being the upcard in the second round the player would order up hearts correct
student,so when i try to compile my euchrecpp there is a compile error that says error no match for ‘operator’ in ‘stdoperator this error comes from code in my gamecpp is this a header error i have include iostream in my cpp file
student,im sorry for asking a lot of questions with regards to the left bower im just really confused anyways lets say bob has this hand queen of clubs jack of spades jack of diamonds nine of clubs king of spades the trump suit is hearts when drew leads with an ace of diamonds should bob play his jack of diamonds or not i assumed that he should not because the jack of diamonds is now of the heart suit since he cannot follow suit since he does not have any diamonds he should play his lowest card nine of clubs later when the heart is led he should play his jack of diamonds correct ie this is the sequence of evernts i have would that be correct ace of diamonds led by drew queen of diamonds played by alice nine of clubs played by bob nine of diamonds played by cathy drew takes the trick king of hearts led by drew ace of hearts played by alice jack of diamonds played by bob nine of hearts played by cathy bob takes the trick
student,in my euchrecpp i declared a pointer variable of type game and the first time i used it was in gameinit but when i compiled my code there is a warning being treated as error and say that the declared pointer variable is not initialized how do i fix it
student,in the spec it says we are required to print the executable and arguments in the first line our output eg euchre packin noshuffle 1 alice bob cathy drew i figured we either should print this line in euchrecpp or gameinit in gamecpp i then noticed that the rme of gameinit states that it modifies stdout i therefore assume this means we are supposed to print this line in the function how could we print the name of the executable eg euchre in this function when it is only stored in euchrecpp am i wrong and we dont actually print out the line in gameinit if so then what is it supposed to print baring in mind that it modifies stdout thanks
student,the spec says plays one game of euchre does this mean one entire game of euchre ie till someone reaches the maximum points or just one round of euchre
student,if a player leads with the left bower a player can only play trump cards to follow correct
student,so during office hour today the gsi showed us how to use the ddd to debug is there instruction somewhere on how to open it wasnt paying attention to that particular part
student,i saw from earlier posts that we should assign null to the next pointer when packdealone is called for the last card but we still have to return a card which card should be returned
student,when printing out the argvs the argv0 prints the directory holding the executable not the name euchre itself instead of using argv can i just cout the string euchre instead
student,when i use noshuffle my players end up with random memory addresses for cards in their hand does anyone have an idea or is experiencing a similar problem i cant seem to find the cause and i have stepped through my debugger quite a few times
student,has anyone created a pack in a text file that invokes screw the dealer trying to think of other things to test besides euchre march if you have any other ideas of things to test that arent tested in the published test cases we could start that thread here
student,so i was testing and came across this certain bug in my playermaketrump for instance if table is set up such that the players are alice bob alice drew 0 1 2 3 so it turns out that alice has same name as dealer and it also turns out that making goes to round 2 since dealers name is also alice at round 2 after say bob passes the other alice orders because of screw the dealer rule however the code mistakes it for dealer as my code in playermaketrump for round 2 checks for dealer by name so does that mean the way i am checking for dealer is wrong or this case is an exception to what we are suppose to test thanks
student,will the project be graded in terms of individual functions or only as a comprehensive whole thanks
student,right now if my packin file isnt opened correctly my program still prints out the argv arguments on the first line and then proceeds to print out the error message defined in the spec for when an infile fails to open correctly and then exits is this what is supposed to happen or should only the error message be called followed by an exit since the error message comes from packinit which is called inside gamecpp i presume my current output is fine but i just wanted to double check thanks
student,not quite sure what or how to fix this or where this error could be deriving from please help thanks
student,when dealing i use the following card c packdealonepackptr card cptr c then to add a card to a particular hand playeraddcardgameptrplayersi cptr the problem im having is accessing the the individual cards after a deal for example i keep getting seg faults when printing a card from a hand due to the ranks and suits going out of bounds any tips
student,one of my player names turns into vg about halfway through playing the game any idea what is going on here
student,i get a really weird error where three cards after the first two cards dealt arent read they come up as weird numbers and the rest of my pack is dealt fine anyone else have this problem
student,i spent a lot of time working on a helper function for my gameplay only to find out that the helper function will need to return two unique variables back to the game are we allowed to make new structs outside a static function
student,anyone want to suggest a test case they used that found errors in their simulation ive tried everything instructors…any hints
student,are we supposed to test for impossible scenarios for example using a pack that contains duplicates of cards or using a pack that contains 24 duplicates so every card in the pack is the same
student,can anyone spot what the diff mismatch is in this case euchre packin noshuffle 1 alice bob cathy drew euchre packin noshuffle 1 alice bob cathy drew this is for the first test case everything in the body doesnt give me any diff mismatches but for some reason the arguments at the top are spitting this out with 1c1 written after i diff euchretest00out and the correct version
student,so ive passed euchretest00 but i cant seem to pass euchretest01 ive done some debugging and it seems that it involves my packdealone function i have the pack for euchretest01 and the first card is the queen of spades and the next card is the king of spades the function returns the correct card queen of spades but when it increments the next pointer which is done by packptrnext i see that the new packptrnext is the 15 of spades i dont know why i get 15 instead of king any ideas furthermore why does the function work for the first test but not the second one
student,is there anyway we can share output files of obscure test cases to see confirm accuracy
student,if we dont write them do we risk getting marks off for stylecomments
student,i keep getting the error void shufflecardsgame declared static but never defined i have declared static in both the gameh file and gamecpp file they are not written any differently in terms of syntax and grammar i have defined it in the header file any explanation as to why it isnt linking properly
student,so for some reason when i run my euchrecpp bob the second player always have a funny symbol representing him this always happen to the second players name and only the second player everyone elses name is fine can someone explain whats going on

student,im looking at how my packdealone is functioning more closely heres a sample of some of my current output when dealing cards current player being dealt cards bob nine of spades next is pointing to 0x7fff55d7c868 0x7fff55d7c8b0 player bobs hand size 1 0x7fff55d7c8b0 player bobs hand size 2 0x7fff55d7c8b0 player bobs hand size 3 current player being dealt cards cathy nine of spades next is pointing to 0x7fff55d7c870 0x7fff55d7c8b0 player cathys hand size 1 0x7fff55d7c8b0 player cathys hand size 2 current player being dealt cards drew nine of spades next is pointing to 0x7fff55d7c878 0x7fff55d7c8b0 player drews hand size 1 0x7fff55d7c8b0 player drews hand size 2 0x7fff55d7c8b0 player drews hand size 3 current player being dealt cards alice nine of spades next is pointing to 0x7fff55d7c880 shouldnt the addresses be increasing by the same amount each time in my case they are going up two then up eight
student,can we assume the four players have different names from one another eg alice bob cathy drew or can there be a case where there are two cathys playing eg cathy bob cathy drew if a team cathy can exist then i need to change some of my code
student,if we mess up the arguments do we still print out the arguments or do we only print out the error message for instance euchre packin noshuffle 1 alice bob cathy drew youssef usage euchre packfilename shufflenoshuffle pointstowin name1 name2 name3 name4 or usage euchre packfilename shufflenoshuffle pointstowin name1 name2 name3 name4 and should there be a new line after the arguments are printed and the error message for instance euchre fakein noshuffle 1 alice bob cathy drew error opening fakein or euchre fakein noshuffle 1 alice bob cathy drew error opening fakein im guessing there should be a newline there but im not sure whether the arguments still get printed
student,in gameinit do we use packinitpacktouse packfilename then use gameptrpack packtouse to initialize the pack
student,this should be real quick im just a little confused on the time line of things ought i consider the upcards suit as trump when calling playeraddanddiscard that is should the dealer handle that upcard as a trump card that is the trumpness in now effect for the game thanks a 106
student,for the second published test im getting the correct score of 105 in linux but in terminal when running the exact same files im getting a different output 108 instead does anyone have any idea why that is thanks
student,instructors can we do this im pretty sure can combine our resources and conquer dont post answers if a decent amount of people contribute im sure everyone will find something they missed what errorssituationstests have you encountered that you had to account for further than the published test cases left bower as the turned card comparing the turned card to decide whether to take it or not same name of dealer and another player same name of two randomall players testing euchre and march
student,i have a player winner and the gameplayers in my function i want to find out which is the winner in the gameplayers i have 2 methods the first one is to compare the address of winner and each player in the gameplayers the second one is to compare the name of winner and the name of each player in the gameplayers aka gameplayersi name which way is better in this situation thanks
student,for helper functions do we still declare them at the top and define them afterwards since we use static ex static foo static foo or do we just use static foo
student,yesterday vidal recommended us to write a program that created a pack based on the hands that we wanted each player to have has anyone written this care to share as a group testing tool
student,okay so i thought it would be good if everyone would take turns uploading packs and their respective outputs let help each other squash bugs ill start here is the pack httpswwwdropboxcomshv9k9m19uq9smnftestpack01in and here is my output with the following command line euchre testpack01in shuffle 10 alice bob cathy drew httpswwwdropboxcomsp50kpc81i7wzzjttest01out
student,so my code compiled and ran just fine when i compiled it according the the specs but when i try to submit it to submit280 i keep on getting warning could not compile with card pack player game euchre can someone explain to me what i am doing wrong
student,so ive been using the makefile to test and im passing all the test cases given i have someones output for noshuffle100 and outputed my result to a file and it says they are not the same thing is when i copy and paste the text from both these files into online diff checkers diff checker and diffnow they say the files are identical any idea why this could be happening
student,my code has occasionally been outputting a character that looks like a small matrix of the form 0001 when it should be outputting a players name what does this character mean
student,when i submit the terminal returns the following error playertest afsumicheduclasseecs280proj3playertest00cpp93 int main assertion cardcomparecardled jackspades 0 failed sh line 1 17814 aborted playertest 21 playertestout warning did not pass one or more scenarios in player test warning did not pass the endtoend noshuffle test case warning did not pass the endtoend shuffle test case it says that there is an error at line 93 in playertest00cpp but when i compare the output for my code with the correct output for playertest00 the output is the same my output for the entire game is also the same as the correct output for the game so i was just wondering what the error means and why it is being called as an error since my output for both files is correct any help would be appreciated and thank you in advance
student,when trying to submit my project i get this compile error but when i compiled and ran the code on my own in both caen and xcode it worked perfectly fine and passed all the published test cases what does this error mean is there something wrong with the auto grader or is it my code
student,are the test cases on the submit280 script endtoend shuffle and endtoend noshuffle the same as as euchretest00 and euchretest01 my code seems to run fine on those test cases but no the submit script says it doesnt pass
student,is it fine to print things within functions that were preprototyped or will the autograder mark this as incorrect for example print the card that is lead cout card within card playerleadcard
student,does our program have to print the arguments of the command line on the first line before the game is played
student,hi when i compare my output with the correct output using the published test cases i got the following difference but couldnt figure out why thank you
student,i was able to open it when i turned in the project for checkpoint for some reason i keep getting an error when trying open the file i have saved it in the proper place as it has worked before and i am pretty positive that my code is correct since it has worked before as well i have also tried making my own txt file and tried to open that as well but it hasnt worked any suggestions please
student,when i submit i get the following warning warning did not pass the endtoend noshuffle test case warning did not pass the endtoend shuffle test case when i diff my output it is the same and based on other posts i ran it though a diffchecker online and got that they are the exact same what exactly is end to end shuffle and noshuffle testing i looked through the provided tests and test cases but couldnt find anything
student,does anyone know the way to change visual studio settings so you can copy past your out put into diff checker thank you
student,when i submit the autograder tells me that my testcases failed however i cannot figure out how my output is different than the correct output diffcheckercom sees no difference between my output and the correct output except for the very last line after win this is the same for both the shuffle and noshuffle test cases is this really what is causing my program to fail ps i dont actually think those are different but when i paste the result of my code from the linux terminal is puts a space after win this space isnt actually there in my code
student,i just dont know i was finishing up testing and then this fun guy popped up now my code fails the suitnext assertion error which should be impossible i have no idea what happened can anyone give me an idea of what causes this error to occur so i can try and fix it
student,when making trump during round two the spec says during round two a player will order up the suit with the same color as the up card if he has one or more face cards of that suit in his hand suppose the up card is hearts 1 the suit with the same color as the up card means only diamonds or both hearts and diamonds are satisfied 2 that suit means which suit if is referring to thank you
student,so im debugging packtest00 with gdb the moment and its giving me a segmentation fault at the packshuffle function when i step through it everything works fine and the loops all work so i am confident the segfault is not from array overflow however by the time the packshuffle function returns it tells me that packptr0x000address and then the next line tells me packptrvalue optimized out and then gives me a segmentation fault and crashed before i can get back to continue packtest00 i have no idea why this might be happening can anyone else help
student,i have written really good test cases to look for march euchre over 100 hands and a few boundaries if you want to collaborate test cases have something to contribute you should email me
student,i have passed the the test for shuffle but caen said i did not pass for nonshuffle i found there is a white space issue and corrected it still it would only pass the shuffle test attached is the output diff from a online website if there is any thoughts about it feel free to response thanks for your help
student,do we have to delete all asserts used in our code if not will we get points off it
student,so i just got my code to pass the two endtoend test cases provided and i ran it through a random 15point game that i made sure the correct logic was executed with no problems however upon submitting my playeraddanddiscard is failing the assertion in playertest00 is this a big deal for grading since the function obviously does what its supposed to do if im passing actual gameplay test cases
student,hand0 alice deals ace of diamonds turned up bob passes cathy passes drew passes alice orders up diamonds ace of spades led by bob nine of hearts played by cathy queen of hearts played by drew ace of hearts played by alice bob takes the trick king of spades led by bob ten of hearts played by cathy king of hearts played by drew queen of diamonds played by alice alice takes the trick jack of diamonds led by alice ten of clubs played by bob queen of clubs played by cathy ten of diamonds played by drew drew has diamond in his suit but the eucher01 test case shows the use of jack of heart instead alice takes the trick ace of diamonds led by alice jack of clubs played by bob king of clubs played by cathy nine of diamonds played by drew alice takes the trick king of diamonds led by alice queen of spades played by bob ace of clubs played by cathy jack of hearts played by drew drew takes the trick alice and cathy win the hand alice and cathy have 1 points bob and drew have 0 points the difference has been highlighted in bold while playing the card the player must play highest card of the suit led or else the lowest card present in his hand the test case shows that jack of heart must be used but there is nine of diamond and ten of diamond present in the hand why not use that
student,this question may have already been asked but i certainly cant find it what should the output be if a march and euchre occur at the same time should both be printed and in what order or should one take precedence which one
student,afsumicheduclasseecs280submit280 3 cardcpp packcpp playercpp gamecpp euchrecpp is that the correct way to submit because i am getting the error error you do not seem to be submitting from caen you must use loginenginumichedu or caen vnc press any key to abort
student,im trying to figure out why im still failing playertest00 when i run it i get playertest00cpp98 int main assertion cardcomparecardled jackspades 0 failed but i did not change the original cardcompare function in cardcpp that they gave us or am i missing something really obvious here help please
student,so in the specs it said that if int main has too many arguments etc it should print out the error message usage euchre packfilename shufflenoshuffle pointstowin name1 name2 name3 name4 i just want to make sure that this means if i enter euchre packin troolololol 500 alice bob cathy drew it would print out usage euchre packin troolololol 500 alice bob cathy drew and not usage euchre packfilename shufflenoshuffle pointstowin name1 name2 name3 name4
student,looking at the output of euchretest01outcorrect we see that bob leads the ace of spades in the first trick of the first hand he has however the jack of clubs in his hand as well the output shows by the rank enumeration clubs have a higher rank than spades and where trump is diamonds then clubs is still higher than the ace of spades why does bob lead the ace that doesnt seem to fit the strategy in the spec
student,thank you both so much for amazing office hours a huge shout out to vidal for staying till 345 am on his monday office hours and for all his help you guys are the best
student,i compiled and ran the program perfectly within linux and when i tried to submit this is what i got does anyone know why its not compiling
student,unsure what this message means but it popped up while my terminal was sitting idle after compiling and running the project and them submitting my project seems to work well with no errors on published test cases also im editing on the terminal and gedit through a vnc connection gedit14849 gtkcritical iagtkwidgetisancestor assertion ancestor null failed it randomly printed out on my terminal about 20 times while i was doing something else in firefox anybody have any experience with this

student,when a player leads a trick he plays the highest nontrump card in his hand i made my cardcompare based on the diamondclubsheartsspades suit ranking yet in the correct output ace of spades beats queen of clubs even though it is a lower suit
student,so i am running into error when i try to submit my code i keep getting warning end to end shuffle failed does this mean that i have some whitespace lying around somewhere also someone on piazza said that i can compare my code to find the whitespace error i have compared my code to the euchretest00outcorrect and its perfectly matched is there something else i need to compare to
student,for some reason my shuffle code correctly shuffles for the first hand of euchretest01 but after that the players have the wrong hands my logic for following was as follows initial pack gets shuffled 3 times following the spec hand 0 is dealt and played pack gets put back in the order it was before dealing hand 0 and from there is shuffled 3 times according to the spec hand 1 is dealt and played is my shuffling logic wrong someplace thank you

student,are style points being graded on all cpp files or just game and euchre
student,i think my partner dropped this course but im not sure we worked on the p3 checkpoint 1 together so some of his files not gamecpp or euchrecpp may be similar to mine if he does end up turning something in i just want to make sure that i cannor be penalized for similar precheckpoint1 code thanks
student,when i type in euchre packin noshuffle 1 alice bob cathy drew euchretest00out all i get is segmentation fault my guess is that the segmentation fault is somewhere within my gamecpp but when i input gdb euchre i get an error no executable how do i go through my gamecpp in gdb to try and locate the segmentation fault
student,in playermaketrump is the future left bower considered a card of the same suit at the upcard for example if a queen of diamonds is the upcard and the deciding player has a jack of hearts is the jack of hearts considered a card of the same suit as the queen of diamonds even though it is not the left bower until the player calls up the queen
student,it might sound a bit odd but i wanted to know if we are expected to follow some kind of standard procedure in naming our helper functions i ask because i gave some of my helper very weird names some for fun and some out of spite i wanted to know if this would be a penalty in the style criteria during grading thank you
student,which one of these outputs are correct the difference is in bold option 1 hand 3 drew deals nine of clubs turned up alice passes bob orders up clubs ace of diamonds led by alice ten of diamonds played by bob jack of diamonds played by cathy queen of diamonds played by drew alice takes the trick option2 hand 3 drew deals nine of clubs turned up alice passes bob orders up clubs ace of diamonds led by alice ten of diamonds played by bob jack of diamonds played by cathy king of spades played by drew alice takes the trick
student,in euchretest00outcorrect jack of diamonds is called up which would mean that in this case alice should pick up the card and discard another however this is not the case as it is not seen anywhere in the correct file alice deals jack of diamonds turned up nine of diamonds is played by alice ace of clubs is played by alice ten of diamonds is played by alice jack of hearts is played by alice queen of hearts is played by alice am i understanding the spec wrong
student,if i dont use any helper functions for gameplay well see haha as far as ive understood from the other questions regarding this i wont need to do any rmes correct since all the functions we had to define had them in the hs and if thats the case the only style id need is general spacingcomments on the difficult parts of my code correct thanks
student,hey guys i hope project 3 went well as you may know project 4 will take into consideration your test cases and i recently stumbled upon this and thought this would be helpful httpstrilanccomtesting20140318positivebiasandtestinghtml
student,just wanted to clarify because ive seen a lot of differing test cases but lets say its round 1 and ten of spades turned up drew has queen of hearts king of diamonds nine of clubs jack of clubs queen of spades drew will order up because he has both the jack of clubs and queen of spades will he pick up the ten of spades because there are nontrumps in his hand a trump card regardless of its rank will always be worth more than a nontrump card right because based on my code he should be picking up the ace of spades and dropping the nine of clubs
student,its getting down to the wire and im not sure if im going to be able to pass the testcases in time if i cant finish it is there a way to submit what i have for partial credit
student,i typed down what was in the spec but its not letting me through
student,is it just define ndebug and does it matter if it goes before cassert or after
student,the command line will be euchre packx noshuffle 1 alice bob cathy drew where x is the number of the pack httpswwwdropboxcomshs6l5dqcjvw8t4dspx6asianhe the outputs correspond to the pack
student,in gamecpp i wrote static helper functions as many others i have a question about this do i have to declare the stubs like this that are bolded static void functionone game gameptr int someint static void functiononegameptr someint some code here
student,in the first trick of the first hand for test01 according to euchretest01outputcorrect alice should play the ace of hearts however in my version she played the nine of clubs since the strategy says to play the lowest card in the hand and the nine of clubs is undoubtedly lower than the ace of hearts in every way unless you compare by suits alone i am wondering if the test case is wrong
student,suppose at the beginning of a game you are bob and you are dealt queen of clubs jack of spades jack of diamonds nine of clubs king of spades alice is the dealer a king of diamonds turned up we prob all understand why you should pass during the first round lets further assume no one accepted the upcard during the first round so its your turn again where you can only order up the hearts suit or pass notice you have only one red card the jack of diamonds which is a left bower if hearts becomes the trump suit however you dont have any hearts as a player defined by the spec do you pass or order up hearts thx
student,leads the highest nontrump card in his hand so the player should not lead the left bower if he has any nontrump cards still in his hand ie at the lead the leftbower is trump
student,hey i was just wondering if since the spec said to yse c strings everywhere is it still okay to use c strings just for comparison for instance in euchrecpp to check if its shuffle or no shuffle also what does it mean to avoid passing large structs by value could anyone give an example so i could make sure im not doing it thanks
student,when my partner and i try tests with other packs we mess up but it seems that most if not all tests with packin do work does anyone have any insight as to what could be going on ie are there any areas where functions could be packspecific
student,for some reason my code works perfectly fine except for the fact that the bowers arent taking priority the right bower is being overruled by a higher trump face card and the left bower is being overruled by any face trump in general my cardcpp passed the checkpoint so what could be causing this
student,ive checked every new line online diff checker says the files are identical command line diff checker says the difference between outputs is at the last line ive tried every combination of newlines after player and player win but i still cant pass endtoend help
student,hi im trying to print the player names stored in gameptr in my gameplay function cant cant seem to get it to work what i currently have as a general example is cout gameptrplayerstablecounter orders up tablecardsdealerindexsuit endl thats the only thing i can come up with that doesnt make the compiler puke errors and all it results in is printing the memory address of the array space ive tried other things including gameptrplayerstablecounter gameptrplayerstablecounter these both create compiler errors and im not sure why any help is appreciated thanks

student,until now i have been using putty to ssh into caen and scp files between my home windows computer and caen however i need to enter my password everytime i ssh or scp and this can be quite annoying in the long run i tried looking into setting up an ssh key on my home computer and in the caen ssh directory with puttygenexe by following the instructions in this link httpwwwtonidocomblogindexphp20090220sshwithoutpasswordusingputtyuytt8pliu following these instructions did not work and im still required to enter my password so i was wondering has anyone managed to sshscp to caen without having to enter their password everytime i truly appreciate any guidance
student,there is a block of lines in the spec that im not clear on since each of your implementation cpp files will be graded separately by compiling it with our solution code do not write code that contains interfile dependencies such that one of your files depends on another one of your files for example do not write an extern function in handcpp that you use in playercpp what exactly is meant by extern function

student,i just thought id finally get this straightened out… so suppose that one has something like this struct witharray int ray 100 according to lecture if i were to copy one of these into another one of them the array would behave like a pointer a shallow copy would happen and then both arrays would be aliased here is some testing code void printinfoconst witharray a const witharray b cout addresses aray bray endl cout aray for const int it aray it aray 100 it cout it cout endl cout bray for const int it bray it bray 100 it cout it cout endl int main witharray a b for int i 0 i 100 i arayi i brayi 100i printinfoa b cout endl b a printinfoa b cout endl bray10 99999999 printinfoa b return 0 and here is that codes output addresses 0x7fff5fbff718 0x7fff5fbff588 aray 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 43 44 45 46 47 48 49 50 51 52 53 54 55 56 57 58 59 60 61 62 63 64 65 66 67 68 69 70 71 72 73 74 75 76 77 78 79 80 81 82 83 84 85 86 87 88 89 90 91 92 93 94 95 96 97 98 99 bray 100 99 98 97 96 95 94 93 92 91 90 89 88 87 86 85 84 83 82 81 80 79 78 77 76 75 74 73 72 71 70 69 68 67 66 65 64 63 62 61 60 59 58 57 56 55 54 53 52 51 50 49 48 47 46 45 44 43 42 41 40 39 38 37 36 35 34 33 32 31 30 29 28 27 26 25 24 23 22 21 20 19 18 17 16 15 14 13 12 11 10 9 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1 addresses 0x7fff5fbff718 0x7fff5fbff588 aray 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 43 44 45 46 47 48 49 50 51 52 53 54 55 56 57 58 59 60 61 62 63 64 65 66 67 68 69 70 71 72 73 74 75 76 77 78 79 80 81 82 83 84 85 86 87 88 89 90 91 92 93 94 95 96 97 98 99 bray 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 43 44 45 46 47 48 49 50 51 52 53 54 55 56 57 58 59 60 61 62 63 64 65 66 67 68 69 70 71 72 73 74 75 76 77 78 79 80 81 82 83 84 85 86 87 88 89 90 91 92 93 94 95 96 97 98 99 addresses 0x7fff5fbff718 0x7fff5fbff588 aray 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 43 44 45 46 47 48 49 50 51 52 53 54 55 56 57 58 59 60 61 62 63 64 65 66 67 68 69 70 71 72 73 74 75 76 77 78 79 80 81 82 83 84 85 86 87 88 89 90 91 92 93 94 95 96 97 98 99 bray 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 99999999 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 43 44 45 46 47 48 49 50 51 52 53 54 55 56 57 58 59 60 61 62 63 64 65 66 67 68 69 70 71 72 73 74 75 76 77 78 79 80 81 82 83 84 85 86 87 88 89 90 91 92 93 94 95 96 97 98 99 as one can see thats not quite the case the addresses printed for the arrays do not change though one would expect them to during the assignment if a pointer copy took place and the change in b afterwards did not magically propagate to a as one would expect if the arrays were in fact aliased why because arrays arent actually pointers array identifiers do convert to pointers at the touch of a feather which makes arrays appear identical to pointers in most practical applications for example indexingdereferencing arrays works exactly the same way as indexingdereferencing pointers printing an array using the streams library is the same as printing a pointer and passing an array into a function is passing a pointer however there are some slight differences using sizeof on an actual pointer will give you the size of a pointer 8 bytes on a 64bit machine while using sizeof on an array will give you the product of the number of elements and sizeof the elements type the address of an array is equivalent to the pointer it decays to if ray is an array staticcastvoidray staticcastvoidray and of course the thing noted above where arrays in structs are actually deepcopied by default granted i dont blame anyone for not actually knowing what happens to raw arrays in structs when they are defaultcopied i dont remember ever having any code that actually depended directly on it either arrays not particularly useful as data structures when compared to the stl containers especially now that we have stdarray which does all of the things that array does but in a wellbehaved manner i believe arraystruct copying works the same in c though it seems like for most of the other languages one hears about these days its a moot point since they dont even give one the choice to use an array or just about any compound type directly on the stack in summary arrays inside structs are actually deepcopied and not shallowcopied as was suggested in lecture and so if you use the default copy constructor for a struct containing an array it wont spawn any sorts of weird aliasing bugs itll just copy the entire thing elementbyelement like youd expect it to
student,so in addcard what should we do for aces are we supposed to write some sort of strategy for aces within this function should we default it to a certain value please to help
student,does this function need to increment nextbefore returning if so how do we handle for the case where we are returning the final card in the deck
student,hi is multiround noshuffle situation being tested if so how is it possible to reset the next pointer without calling the shuffle function do them individually i mean it seems to be sure to cause seg fault
student,for project 3 i was curious as to what the last 5 point test case did im assuming it error checked to see whether each cstring was inputted correctly and i did see a problem with one of the statements but the others worked fine i seemed to have been comparing cstrings rather than integers for the points to win but if i typed something else other than noshuffle or shuffle it would give me the error message and if i typed more than 8 arguments i would get the error message i was wondering if i could get partial points because 5 points is a lot
student,what exacttly is a euchre through test im not understanding its format to be exact these test cases below euchretest21 thorough test noshuffle round 12 march euchretest22 thorough test noshuffle round 1 single point left bower euchretest23 thorough test noshuffle round 12 euchred left bower
student,are we allowed to add member variables for the inherited players the one that comes to mind would be the running sum for the counting player
student,are we allowed to make the counting player a derived class from the simple player or should the both be directly derived from player
student,i am having difficulty figuring out how to modify the contents of deckcardsdecksize in the deck default constructor i have several loops set up to take care of proceeding through the ranks suits and cards in the deck but my question comes down to how to set a card into the cards array for example lets say the deck default constructor only sets one card into the deck and that card is a five of hearts deckdeck card fiveofheartscardrank five cardsuit hearts cards0 fiveofhearts this gives me an error regarding the operator and does not work so you cant copy a card into the array alternatively deckdeck cards0rank cardrank five cards0suit cardsuit hearts this doesnt work because rank and suit are private member variables of the card class and you arent allowed to access them i feel like this is an easy problem but for some reason i am having a lot of trouble figuring out the proper way of changing the values of the null cards initialized in the deckcards array thanks for any help you can provide
student,under the heading the player interface it is mentioned that if the players hand totals 12 he stands if the dealer shows 4 5 or 6 otherwise he hits what does show mean in this context also the spec makes no mention of what a hole card is
student,lets say i made counter class derive from simple class and simple class has a private member variable that i want to get access to can i write a get function in my simple class which i can then use in my counter class
student,should any of the player classes contain any member variables should they just have member functions
student,in the directions to shuffle what does fill in mean context provided then rearrange the deck to be the first card of the right then the first card of the left the 2nd of right the 2nd of left and so on once one side is exhausted fill in the remainder of the deck with the cards remaining in the othe rside thanks
student,are we not supposed to submitbe given a basic test for handcpp
student,if the inputs to the program are such that the initial bankroll is less than the minimum bet does the program still shuffle the cards and output the process of doing so
student,are we allowed to add a private function like indexof in lab08
student,when is an ace considered an 11 when doing so does not make the player bust
student,looking for someone to work on project 4 with ive done very well on the other projects and have a car to drive up to north campus office hours with
student,in playerh the hand argument to the virtual bool draw function has the argument const hand player why is the hand passed by reference if it is a const just for efficiency does this have something to do with avoiding copy constructors thanks
student,can i have my competitor class derive from simple class and use the simple draw function but have the competitor class just differ in that it has its own version of virtual function int bet
student,the only case where the hands are equal that is not a push is when the player and dealer are each dealt natural 21s in that case the player is still paid 32 if the player is dealt an ace plus any ten or face card the players hand is called a natural 21 and the players wager is paid off with 3 to 2 odds without examining the dealers cards after the player got a natural 21 do we still need to check the dealers cards or do we simply end this hand not progress to the dealer and pay the player with 3 to 2 odds
student,what does this mean thanks
student,we have a player type variable but when we use the character to make it a pointer it tells us that it cant convert from int to player what is really confusing is that if we add another character it converts into player which is not we want basically we can get types int player and player but not player this is occurring in gameplay with the playermaketrump function call
student,can we assume that different names will be entered for each player thanks
student,im confused about how to get the names from playernames in the gameinit function i keep getting a seg fault when i try to use playerinit
student,the rme says it will modify gameptr however gameptr is passed by value i think what it really means is that it modifies the game that gameptr is pointed to i think this is really tricky and many bugs actually will come from here requires packfilename file contains a wellformed euchre pack modifies gameptr stdout effects initializes game pointed to by gameptr including initializing the pack and each player void gameinit game gameptr const char packfilename bool shuffle int pointstowin const char const playernames
student,will the final exam include the materials in midterm exam thanks
student,if we reset the pack back to the beginning after each hand then wouldnt that result in the same thing happening each time is that what is supposed to happen if shuffling is disabled
student,if all goes correctly doues the euchrecpp program print out usage euchre packfilename shufflenoshuffle pointstowin name1 name2 name3 name4 or euchre packin noshuffle 1 alice bob cathy drew
student,im confused about how the up card is a jack of diamonds if the deck is not supposed to be shuffle and the first card in packin is a nine of spades so i thought that the up card should also be a nine of spades can someone please explain to me how it is the jack of diamonds
student,in my argv checks i perform a check as to whether or not the inputed points to win contains all digits no other characters a decimal point fails my check do i need to allow for decimal points
student,i couldnt find my midterm today after professor ringenbergs lecture im not sure if it was because i didnt complete the first page of my exam correctly or if i just couldnt find it due to the sheer number of people looking for their exams either way whenwhere can i collect my exam from
student,are we allowed to add small functions to gamecpp to handle larger jobs in gameplay
student,i had a quick question about the correct output for euchretest01 in hand 0 the third trick jack of diamonds led by alice ten of clubs played by bob queen of clubs played by cathy jack of hearts played by drew alice takes the trick why is drew playing hearts in the next two tricks he is playing diamonds and i thought that if a player could follow suit then they would play diamonds i know that the jack of hearts is the left bower but was there something in the spec about when to play the left bower vs just following the suit that was led thanks
student,on page 3 at the top the spec spells euchered on page 4 at the bottom the spec spells euchred as output which should it be thanks
student,say the upcard is a king of spades one player has the ace of diamonds nine of spades ten of spades ace of spades and the queen of diamonds would this player order up during round 2 would they order up spades or clubs im not sure i understand the spec in this instance thanks ahead of time
student,are we allowed to copy the suitnames array over to other files specifically into gamecpp so i can print just the suit using that array for when people order up
student,in the published test case wouldnt drew play king of hearts in the first round instead of queen of hearts he plays king of hearts in the second round instead… alice deals ace of diamonds turned up bob passes cathy passes drew passes alice orders up diamonds ace of spades led by bob nine of hearts played by cathy queen of hearts played by drew ace of hearts played by alice bob takes the trick king of spades led by bob ten of hearts played by cathy king of hearts played by drew queen of diamonds played by alice alice takes the trick
student,specifically trying to pass an int variable by reference in order to keep track of cards being dealt through function calls
student,alice orders up diamonds ace of spades led by bob nine of hearts played by cathy queen of hearts played by drew can someone explain to me why drew plays the queen of hearts if spades is led this is from the euchre shuffle test first hand if a player can follow suit he plays the highest card that follows suit otherwise he plays the lowest card in his hand
student,how do i do it also i dont know if the command might be different since i am using cygwin on a windows machine
student,suppose alice is the dealer and currently holds the jack of hearts queen of hearts ace of clubs 9 of diamonds and the 10 of diamonds the upcard is the jack of diamonds will alice anticipate having two bowers not to mention 4 total trump in her hand and pick up the jack of diamonds in the first round even though she does not currently physically hold two trump face cards in her hand
student,at the end of each hand do we reshuffle the deck and redeal
student,if im debugging on euchrecpp is there a way i can print variables from other source files i want to check variables in gamecpp but im not sure what command id use thanks in advance
student,lets say ive just completed hand 0 do i need to place all the cards that were played at the end of the pack before shuffling in hand 1 or do i simply shuffle the exact pack order used in hand 0
student,for hand 1 if cathy orders up clubs and she owns nine of hearts ten of hearts jack of hearts king of clubs ace of clubs wouldnt cathy drop nine of hearts and pick up jack of spades isnt jack of spades the left bower cathy does not pick up jack of spades based on the euchre test correct output see below hand 1 bob deals jack of spades turned up cathy passes drew passes alice passes bob passes cathy orders up clubs jack of hearts led by cathy king of hearts played by drew ace of hearts played by alice nine of spades played by bob alice takes the trick king of diamonds led by alice ace of diamonds played by bob nine of hearts played by cathy jack of diamonds played by drew bob takes the trick ten of spades led by bob ten of hearts played by cathy nine of diamonds played by drew queen of diamonds played by alice bob takes the trick jack of clubs led by bob ace of clubs played by cathy ten of diamonds played by drew ten of clubs played by alice bob takes the trick queen of clubs led by bob king of clubs played by cathy queen of hearts played by drew nine of clubs played by alice cathy takes the trick bob and drew win the hand euchred alice and cathy have 1 points bob and drew have 2 points
student,hello when we are making trump in the first round we compare just the suit correct for instance if a club turns up we do not count the jack of spades as a club facecard right also when making trump in the second round if the upcard is diamonds would we regard the jack of hearts as a counted facecard would we count the jack of diamonds as a counted facecard i guess what im mainly asking is in regards jacks in the making do we only consider the cards suit and not the possibility of a trump jack suit change thanks ahead of time
student,in gamecpp im trying to add a card to a players hand during the deal the card im adding is determined by the function packdealone which i call in playeraddcard the problem is that packdealone returns a type card but that type isnt being recognized in playercpp why
student,can someone explain to me the purpose of makefile do we need to use it when compiling all our files
student,just to clarify we are reading the command line euchre packin shuffle 10 alice bob cathy drew into the function gameinit
student,jack of diamonds led by alice ten of clubs played by bob queen of clubs played by cathy jack of hearts played by drew alice takes the trick this is from the correct output alice started by leading with diamond suit and drew has diamonds in his hand why didnt drew play a diamond card diamond is the trump by the way i thought that can follow suit means a player has a same suit as the lead card but the out put is not what i expected does it actually means a player not only has a card of the same suit as the lead card but also can defeat the lead card
student,say the upcard is a king of spades and during round two a player has the following cards nine diamonds ten diamonds nine clubs jack spades jack diamonds would this player order up clubs during round 2
student,while testing euchretest01 im coming across these characters could someone explain to me what they are and possibly why they are happening they also appear instead of the players names when sometimes when the players play cards
student,in this function are we supposed to add a segment of code that would discard the card returned card the player has chosen from the players hand i am working on the playing portion of the gameplay and am not sure how to go about discarding all the cards that were played at the end of a trick since i dont know what position of their hand the card came from thanks in advance
student,should i design the game to be played by four players or any number of players will this be tested
student,before i can use a game object when calling gameinit in main i have to declare a game object first but if i just declare it and dont initialize it to anything i get an error and setting it to null appears to be causing problems in the implementation of gameinit so what exactly should we be initializing gameptr to before it gets really initialized in gameinit
student,im having a hard time with the playing portion of the gameplay i cant seem to figure out a good way to compare all of the card the players have played with each other while keeping track of who that winning card belongs to could anyone give me a hint
student,with the expression packdealonegameptrpack i get the compiler error gamecpp51 error taking address of temporary why is this the case what does it mean for data to be temporary
student,i get the error message error opening executable am i missing something
student,do we have to worry about these inputs
student,card leadcard playerleadcardleftplayer trumpsuit card leadcardptr leadcard cardprintleadcardptr cout led by leftplayername endl the bolded portion of the code gives me a bad access error what am i doing wrong
student,eg alex and cathy win the hand euchred vs alex and cathy win the hand euchred
student,im having a problem where i declare a game game and then when i pass it into gameinit and compile i receive an error message saying that game is used uninitialized this is simple a warning due to the compilers flag but im assuming it shouldnt show up whether its a warning or an error this is the part of my code that seems to be having a problem it seems like a pain to declare each individual member variable of game some of which are other structs i thought that that was the gameinits purpose and not mine game game gameinitgame argv0 strcmpargv1 shuffle atoiargv2 argv 3
student,when i error check to see if the third argument to the main function is equal to the string shuffle i keep getting an error message that the two strings are not the same however when i add a cout statement printing argv2 it displays shufflein other words argv2 and shuffle should be the same thing can someone explain to me what the problem is this is a simple problem that that i need to move past to actually begin debugging
student,i think im done with the project and passed all test cases can you give examples of what other fucnitons we should be testing to ensure our code is good before we submit
student,is gameplay supposed to output each move that is made
student,the following line of code gives us a seg fault though im not sure why gameptrplayersihandsize 5
student,while starting to code gameplay i got a seg fault when trying to test my shuffle helper function i tried to find out where the error was occurring using gdb but when i ran the program through the debugger the segfault didnt occur i discovered that when i compiled the code using o1 it seg faulted but when i got rid of it like i had to to for gdb the program ran fine im not sure how the optimizer works so i dont know why this would occur and i cant see where or why the segfault is occurring easily since when i compile it in a way that works for the debugger no error occurs any suggestions on how to fix this running gdb without the o1 i dont see any instances of indexing out of bounds of an array or anything else problematic
student,how do we read in process the command line arguments in euchrecpp and then send your new variables to gameinit if i wanted to read in alice would i just use argv4
student,which direction in the array should we move if we want to move to the left of the dealer
student,which would take precedence if both happened in one hand say team 1 orders up trump and team 2 takes all 5 tricks so they both euchred and marched team 1 so print both marched and euchred or just one and in what order
student,when we are given a filename to read in the wellformed euchre deck can we assume it will look the same as the provided example packin in other words will we have to check for new lines between cards or lines with errors ie spade instead of spades in the file
student,when i try to compile the project in terminal i got the following message anybody knows why thank you tmpccktcbmwo in function main euchrecpptext0x205 undefined reference to gameinitgame char const bool int char const const collect2 ld returned 1 exit status
student,when i submit project03 it says i didnt pass end to end shuffle test what is that test testing about
student,do we play and print out all 5 tricks in a hand regardless of the individual outcomes or should we stop after say one team has won 3 tricks and the other had won 1 thereby making a march impossible
student,i was wondering if there was a way to mimic the command line function in xcode namely to exploit the functions argc and argv
student,to test the implementation of my gameinit i have written gametestcpp whose main will accept the command line arguments as int main int argc const char argv because i want to pass indices 47 of argv to void gameinit game gameptr const char packfilename bool shuffle int pointstowin const char const playernames as elements of a playernames array i needed to put them together into an array const char playernames argv4 argv5 argv6 argv7 but compiling gives the error error cannot convert ‘const char 4’ to ‘const char const’ for argument ‘5’ to ‘void gameinitgame const char bool int const char const’ what is the syntax to set an array a pointer to const
student,in the rme for gameinit it says that its supposed to modify stdout is it actually supposed to output anything to cout or is there an error in the rme
student,when i use diff i am told that there is a difference between my euchretest01out and euchretest01outcorrect also between test00 and test00correct however when i copy the files into quickdiff no differences are found i checked for spaces at the end of lines and at the end of the file and i even went through and retyped all my cout statements to make sure there werent problems with copying from the spec are there any other things that quickdiff wouldnt catch that i should check for
student,when the players are leading and playing i am not sure of where to put the cards that they play i am thinking of putting it in the pack that is a part of the game but this pack currently holds the discarded cards not being used this game those cards are irrelevant so i dont think i want to put it there am i expected to make a new data structure to hold this
student,just wondering are we allowed to use ear plugs during exams
student,valgrind is printing out this error for my segfault 14601 invalid write of size 8 14601 at 0x100002942 playeraddcardplayer card const playercpp29 14601 by 0x100002079 dealgame int gamecpp62 14601 by 0x100001c3d playhandbool game pack int gamecpp161 14601 by 0x100001a66 gameplaygame gamecpp193 14601 by 0x10000086a main euchrecpp51 14601 address 0x4c5f43978 is not stackd mallocd or recently freed here is the code that it is referring to playerptrhandplayerptrhandsize c what does this mean and why is it not working
student,i created a for loop near the beginning of my gameplay function to loop through the entire game until one of the partnerships earns enough points to win the for loop extends throughout pretty much the entire rest of the program the problem is that when i run my program my for loop is not even entered i checked this by added tracer cout statements within the for loop at the beginning but those are not printed out also as some people who use sublime or xcode may be familiar the curly braces at the beginning and end of the for loop are not being highlighted when the other brace is selected even though they should be the same curly brace problem happens with those of the entire gameplay function i have a feeling that this brace problem is somehow related to the problem with entering my for loop
student,when i go to run the 10 point shuffled euchre game i can only view the output from a little before the fifth hand to the end of the game on the terminal is there a way i can expand the length of output seen on the terminal or will i have to send the output to a file and then view the output file in order to see the output as a whole thanks
student,sometimes during this project it seems to be easier to access an exact element of an array such as in argv or score using hardcoded numbers instead of variables for example in creating variables to pass into gameinit i would use indices 4 7 to access the strings containing the players name since the player names array for gameinit is const so i cant use a loop is there a better way of doing this that is more stylistically correct besides declaring a global const for each index
student,when i compile lab07cpp i get this error tmpccwsefldo in function rectanglerectangledouble double shapescpptext0x5a undefined reference to vtable for rectangle collect2 ld returned 1 exit status can someone help me understand what this error means thanks
student,so in the spec it is clear that in the first round if a player orders up then the dealer receives the upcard in the second round if a player other than the dealer orders up nonscrew the dealer does a the dealer receive the upcard again b the player who ordered up receive the upcard c no one receive the upcard sorry the spec just seems a little vague to me in this area cheers
student,lets say i wanted to make my own struct for i dont know keeping track of partnerships who ordered up whos the dealer etc are we allowed to make our own structs i dont see anything in the spec that tells us that we cant
student,im trying to use suitprint in my gamecpp file specifically a static function i have called gamemaketrump but when i try to compile it gives me this strange error message tmpccpoeypro in function gamemaketrumpgame player card gamecpptext0x2d3 undefined reference to suitprintsuit collect2 ld returned 1 exit status im including cardh in gamecpp and other functions in cardh are working fine eg cardprint any help is appreciated thanks
student,which gsi is in charge of discussion section 17 from 130230 thanks
student,when i compile my code it would always say in constructor circlecircledouble error no matching function for call to ellipseellipse this happens regardless of how i implement it what does this mean
student,i cant seem to find it whats the spec for deciding how the player names a suit or if he passes
student,every time i try to run my code through the debugger i get this error gdb run packin shuffle 10 alice bob cathy drew program exited with code 01 missing separate debuginfos use debuginfoinstall glibc2121132el6x8664 libgcc4474el6x8664 libstdc4474el6x8664 if anyone can help explain whats going on it would be much appreciated
student,in the pdf the instruction says for circleellipse now when you run the code each object in the array should call the correct area function according to its dynamic type ­polymorphism at work what i did was make circle derive from ellipse and have only one function for circle the constructor so that circles are passed in as a ellipse but since the instruction says the array should call the correct area function according to its dynamic is this saying i have to add area for circle and implement it differently than how ellipse does
student,lets say that during my coding of gamecpp i find that one of the functions of player is faulty giving the wrong output i notice this and change it this means though that the version of playercpp that i send in for the checkpoint and the one i send in for the final deadline are different which one is graded
student,i ran into an interesting problem this evening please see the below output from the make test i pass the euchretest00out then run into an issue with the test01 my issues is the following the output when run in visual studio is exactly what the euchretest01outcorrect file has in it when i run the same code through caen and g the output does not take into account the shuffle command i have no idea why the shuffle command is passing the pack test working through virtual studio but is not working through g any help or ideas are much appreciated thanks make test g pedantic wall werror g cardtest00cpp cardcpp o cardtest00 g pedantic wall werror g packtest00cpp packcpp cardcpp o packtest00 g pedantic wall werror g playertest00cpp playercpp packcpp cardcpp o playertest00 g pedantic wall werror g euchrecpp gamecpp playercpp packcpp cardcpp o euchre cardtest00 cardtest00out packtest00 packtest00out playertest00 playertest00out euchre packin noshuffle 1 alice bob cathy drew euchretest00out diff q euchretest00out euchretest00outcorrect euchre packin shuffle 10 alice bob cathy drew euchretest01out diff q euchretest01out euchretest01outcorrect files euchretest01out and euchretest01outcorrect differ make test error 1
student,should the cards be dealt and shuffled in gameinit of gameplay
student,hi i sometimes get confused when trying to increment within a struct say for example i wanted to move the pointer to the next player inside a game struct gameptrplayers gameptrplayers whats the difference between these
student,we have a line of code where we set a response equal to what make trump returns but the parameters for make trump are quite long resulting in the line ending at 143 characters with 12 characters being from tabs is there a way we should split up the function call or do we just leave it like that
student,hi in making trump if during round one all players pass then we go to round two during round two all players pass too which then forces the dealer to order up which one below would be the output suppose we have players abcd and will order up hearts 1 a passes b passes c passes d passes a orders up hearts 2 a passes b passes c passes d passes a passes b passes c passes d passes a orders up hearts thanks
student,i am struggling on the rectangle class implementation specifically i am unsure of how to write the constructor
student,bash41 g wall werror o1 pedantic canvascpp shapescpp lab07cpp o lab07 shapescpp5 error expected unqualifiedid before ‘using’ lab07cpp6 error expected unqualifiedid before ‘using’ used this to compile g wall werror o1 pedantic canvascpp shapescpp lab07cpp o lab07 everythings fine already but cant get over these two mysterious error
student,are we not suppose to discard the cards in playermaketrump according to the specs the following should happen in playertest00cpp 1 bob currently has the cards queen of spades king of spades ace of spades jack of clubs jack of spades 2 bob is the dealer and current player and the upcard is a nine of spades per the spec he orders up 3 since bob is also the dealer he must accept the nine of spades and discard his lowest card which is queen of spades 4 his hand is now nine of spades king of spades ace of spades jack of clubs jack of spades 5 the test cpp then calls addanddiscard for bob with a nine of spades the deck should stay the same as in step 4 but the code is assertplayerhascardinhandawesomespadeshand i bob which compared it to his original hand obviously this is going to give an error so are we not allowed to have the dealer throw away his card in the playercpp function also why does the spec say bob will throw away the upcard if its lower than the cards in his hand i thought that the dealer must accept the upcard no matter what and that is the only time where someone can accept the upcard why is there an option to turn it away i ended up having to make a new static function where the upcard must be accepted
student,will there ever be any cards with rank two through eight in any packin test files i know thats not how euchre is played but those ranks were included in the enum for rank in cardh
student,i am trying to use diff and i put in some couts to see what i am outputting and nothing came out i assumed it was my code but when i typed in cout hello still nothing came out i checked the testout file to see if anything was put in there but i didnt find anything in there either can someone tell me why there was no compile error just no output
student,so when i run my program multiple times without changing the code it gives me different outputs is there any reason that this might happen im not sure how sometimes it works perfectly fine then other times it runs indefinitely shouldnt it do the same thing every time
student,should we update the cards that a player has in hisher hands after every play ie unpointing the card just played
student,in the correct output after the first hand the output is alice and cathy have 1 points i just wanted to confirm that the incorrect plural is okay here thanks
student,i have collected all of the cards played in a trick into an array at first i thought this was the best way to go about it but im having trouble going back and finding the index of the winner in the player array i collected the cards into a seperate array to cardcompare them but i feel like this ends up being a round about approach any suggestions are much appreciated
student,if making reaches the dealer during the second round we invoke screw the dealer where the dealer is forced to order up in the case of screw the dealer the dealer will always order up the suit with the same color as the up card consider this scenario suppose the cards are dealt from pack and the upcard is jack of hearts the remaining 3 cards behind the upcard are ace of diamonds jack of diamonds and king of diamonds no one orders up during round 1 because heshe doesnt have at least 2 heart face cards since the queen of diamonds is not one of the four cards the kitty we are guaranteed that it is in someones handpossibly even the dealers hand making then moves to round 2 during round two a player will order up the suit with the same color as the up card if he has one or more face cards of that suit in his hand we know that trump face cards are the right and left bowers and q k a of the trump suit in round 2 someone will order up diamonds if heshe has a diamond face card someone is guaranteed to have the queen of diamonds in my scenario so even if the dealer has this card he will order up because he has a face card of the opposite suit of the upcardnot because he was forced to do so so even if the kitty contains four cards of the opposite color suit as the upcard the dealer is never actually forced to order up because the fifth trump face card of that suit is in someones hand possibly even his right
student,given a card can we know which player has that card
student,i was looking into the project spec and i couldnt figure out how we determine the first person to start the first trick is it to the left of the dealer so if the dealer is 4 then first trick starter is 0 or is it something else
student,in order to test my gamecpp im writing code to overload the operator for the card structure so it can accept arguments of type card and print them to the standard output with their enumerations as strings ive got the nonmember function definition included in my maincpp file ostream operator const ostream out card card return out cardrank cardsuit but the compiler gives me error no match for ‘operator’ in ‘out ’ it doesnt accept a pointer to a const char as a string literal even though this is a normal argument to this operator does anyone know why this is so
student,the spec says the first person to receive a card is left of the dealer that is deal 3232 cards then 2323 cards for a total of 5555 cards if the dealer was player 0 would the dealing process go like this player 1 receives 3 cards player 2 receives 2 cards player 3 receives 3 cards player 0 dealer receives 2 cards player 1 receives 2 cards player 2 receives 3 cards player 3 receives 2 cards player 0 dealer receives 3 cards please let me know if this is the way the cards are dealt im writing my function to do so in this way thanks
student,in the given test case euchre test 01 drew plays the jack of hearts when diamonds is led but the very next hand he plays a diamond isnt this cheating if not is there a reason that it is legal hand 0 alice deals ace of diamonds turned up bob passes cathy passes drew passes alice orders up diamonds ace of spades led by bob nine of hearts played by cathy queen of hearts played by drew ace of hearts played by alice bob takes the trick king of spades led by bob ten of hearts played by cathy king of hearts played by drew queen of diamonds played by alice alice takes the trick jack of diamonds led by alice ten of clubs played by bob queen of clubs played by cathy jack of hearts played by drew alice takes the trick ace of diamonds led by alice jack of clubs played by bob king of clubs played by cathy ten of diamonds played by drew alice takes the trick king of diamonds led by alice queen of spades played by bob ace of clubs played by cathy nine of diamonds played by drew alice takes the trick alice and cathy win the hand alice and cathy have 1 points bob and drew have 0 points
student,the first side to reach 10 points wins in this project the number of points to win will be configurable im confused if i set it to 100 rounds does the program end once someone reaches 10 points or do we continue until all 100 rounds are played
student,when a player leads a trick he plays the highest nontrump card in his hand if he has only trump he plays the highest trump card in his hand does the left bower count as trump in this case to be clear if trump was diamonds and i had a jack of hearts and other nontrump cards in my hand can i play the jack of hearts or not
student,my code works and runs fine but receives these errors that cout is ambiguous
student,the two files are not offered right so we need fully write it
student,would it be too late if i turn in a regrade for my exam on monday during lecture
student,when is the grader for p3 going to be up for submission
student,it says in the header file that the players are initialized in the order around the table is this 0123
student,at the end of each hand are we supposed to shuffle the deck that was dealt at the beginning of the hand or are we to keep track of the order in which the cards were played and shuffle the deck as a result of that
student,for void cardinit can we assume cardptr is properly pointing to an uninitialized card if not do you have any tips on how to handle this case
student,in the function gameplay in gamecpp i am trying to call a static function gamedeal outside of gameplay but it is still in the same file gamecpp i am getting the following error gamedeal was not declared in this scope how should i go about resolving this thank you
student,if shuffling is disabled ie we type in noshuffle in the command line prompt then do we essentially deal the exact same order of cards that we had in the beginning after each hand wouldnt this lead to the same game being played over and over again the only difference being that each player has a different players hand
student,hi im having a problem with the shift 0 to get the sign whenever im coding in this linux environment and i press it i almost always get a string of repeating 0s after it causing me to waste time deleting it i believe it has something to do with the lag with using the vnc and im also using gedit does anyone know how to fix this
student,does a well formed pack always have card cstrings in order of rank of suit
student,the requires clause for this function states that cards must remain in the pack lets say ive called this function enough times so that there is only one card remaining in the pack can dealone be called on this final card if so next would then point to something random in memory do i have to reset the next pointer within the dealone function if im dealing with the final card
student,i know there was a previous post about this but does anyone know a quick way to link up sublime text locally to your caen account ive tried a couple things but it doesnt seem to let me save stuff to caen
student,i have gotten my code to pass the published test case how can i generate more test cases to find any lingering bugs without simulating a euchre game by hand and typing the results in a text file
student,in the process of outputting the declared trump suit in gamecpp i need the string associated with a suit given that i have suit trumphearts i want to do coutbob orders up suitnamestrump but the compiler does not accept that suitnames has been declared in the scope of gamecpp because it was defined in cardcpp and my program had only included cardh do i really have to declare suitnames again in gamecpp so that i can use it
student,if the opposing team chose the trump but your team wins all 5 tricks euchered and march would your team be awarded 2 points or 3 points
student,im confused as to how to call gameinit from main how do i match the contents of the argc array to the arguments of the gameinit function any advice is appreciated char argv void gameinit game gameptr const char packfilename bool shuffle int pointstowin const char const playernames
student,the pdf says that for the main function of euchrecpp we need to read the command line arguments check them for errors and then print them its the check them for errors part that i dont get what does that entail
student,does autograder take into account differences in white space when running kompare even though the files are identical kompare claims they arent unless we check ignore the white space option
student,should our gameinit function include the dealing part of the game or should this be in the gameplay function
student,when i try to test my main euchrecpp i keep getting an error saying tmpcc8tvexbo in function main euchrecpptext0xed undefined reference to gameinitgame char const bool int char const const collect2 ld returned 1 exit status im confused as to what this means because i have all files included and i have defined gameinit in my gamecpp any help would be appreciated
student,when running my program normally i get a seg fault when i am dealing cards to players i decided to use gdb to see where exactly that was however using gdb my checkcommand function for seeing if user input is correct failed and i got the following error message before running gdb usersmynamedesktopp3packin is not a core dump file format not recognized as i write this i realize that this is occurring due to the extra argv argument of gdb is there any way to get around this without altering my gameinit and checkcommand code are there any debugging options that do not effect the starting command arguments thanks
student,so i was going around making sure my styles all as it should be and i noticed that i never used the packdealone and packreset functions i forgot they existed and did my dealing a little bit differently within a subfunction in my gamecpp is that fine or will i need to go reprogram my gamecpp so that it uses those functions
student,whenever i try making a statement in gameinit like gameptrshuffle shuff i get an error saying segmentation fault core dumped this happens with all the variables in the game struct pack pointstowin etc does anyone know why this is happening another example statement i have is gameptrpack pack where pack is initialized using packinit
student,just curious why does makefile wont work in terminal mac in caen it works fine
student,lets say a player who is not the dealer has the jack of spades and four diamonds and the upcard is spades during round 2 will the player order up i am confused because if he orders up same color as upcard clubs his jack of spades will become the left bower and its a face card however before clubs became trump none of the cards in his hand are face cards as the same color of the upcard
student,hey i have a question suppose the trump is spades and the card that is lead is also spades the player has these cards in his hand nine of diamonds ten of diamonds jack of diamonds queen of diamonds and jack of clubs one of the bowers the function playerplaycard should follow suit with the max of the suit if it cant then it would play the min card my question is in this case the jack of clubs should be played correct as it is now considered to be the trump suit and the trump suit was led
student,the spec says that we are supposed to have checks for reading in the command line arguments im confused about how were supposed to do this
student,in caen we can use command line to take argv ie the arguments we need to run the program however in xcode how can we do this
student,when calling the packdealone function i want to take the address of the returning type ie card but the compiler says i cant take the address of a temporary object so i create a local variable as following card carddeal packdealonepackptr playeraddcardplayer1ptr carddeal but this is ugly how can i improve this
student,in round 1 if the dealer orders up does he pick the upcard in round 2 if the player orders up does the dealer pick the upcard in round 2 if the dealer orders up does he pick the upcard
student,when do we get our midterms back
student,i think i am confused about the rule of the game jack of clubs in my understanding is smaller than king of clubs then why would cathy play jack of clubs when he has nine of clubs on his hand hand 0 alice deals jack of diamonds turned up bob passes cathy passes drew passes alice passes bob orders up hearts jack of spades led by bob king of spades played by cathy ace of spades played by drew nine of diamonds played by alice drew takes the trick king of clubs led by drew ace of clubs played by alice nine of spades played by bob jack of clubs played by cathy alice takes the trick ten of diamonds led by alice ten of spades played by bob nine of clubs played by cathy queen of clubs played by drew alice takes the trick
student,am i allowed to use the atoi function in my euchrecpp i am simply taking the of points to win as a string from argv and converting to an int for gameinit to use please let me know if i should devise an alternate solution thanks
student,i added a packprint function to packcpp and packh for my own use for testing the problem is if i made it static i cannot use it elsewhere for my testing purposes is there any way i can make it static and usable in other files or should i just use it as it is and remove it before i submit my project thanks
student,hello i tried compiling the code i made for euchrecpp and i got this bash41 make euchre g euchrecpp o euchre tmpccadlx4to in function main euchrecpptext0x194 undefined reference to gameinitgame char const bool int char const const euchrecpptext0x1a0 undefined reference to gameplaygame collect2 ld returned 1 exit status make euchre error 1 i dont have the slightest idea what this means does anyone here know
student,i have a question concerning when the decision comes around to the dealer in the first round of making will he order up the suit if he has two or more face cards in his hand or if he will have two or more face cards once he picks up the turn up card
student,can anyone tell me how can i initialize a const array by loop for example const int a4 for int i 0 i 4 i ai1 this wont compile
student,seriously we appreciate it so much you guys stuck with us for twelve hours
student,the response on this question is varying a lot so i was wondering whether the following main declarations is valid int mainint argc string argv because a string is an array of characters but then it does require the string library
student,hi do we have the answer key for the past exams
student,hello i do not understand why we cannot get exam solutions specifically for fall 13 the google doc for spring 13 would be helpful in theory however since there is no way to see if our submitted solutions are in fact correct we cannot possibly understand if we are doing things right the only thing that posted exam solutions would do is help us please is there anyway we can get solutions does anyone have another way to go about this thank you
student,from problem 2 part c on the fall 2013 midterm practice exam if we have code void add int foo foo does preincrement change the value as if the variable were passed by reference one of the lines of code calls addx where x is just an int passed by value and i want to know how add operates on it
student,what does the syntax look like for an assignment operation to a function pointer where the function we want to assign is overloaded how do we assign a particular implementation of an overloaded function to a function pointer
student,hey in question four const char in contains the cstrings but how this this array formatted i saw a different pizza post referring to this array as a two dimensional array but that is not how it is written in the question does this array contain null characters between the different cstrings it contains or how are they separated thanks
student,are pointers always passed by reference or does this only apply to arrays
student,if i have the following code int a 5 int ptr a cout ptr endl cout ptr endl why are the addresses different when i cout ptr and ptr
student,i was just wondering if we need to be able to interpret recursive relations such as or if we can assume we will be given functions to write with rmes like in the past exams if we do need to understand them would someone be able to give me a brief overview of the best way to go about interpreting these relations
student,i have an idea of the definition of a segmentation fault but can someone give a couple different examples of when this error would appear
student,in a recursive function if i returned a call to a function within a call to a function what wouldnt be tail recursive right ex return somerecursivex2 somerecursivex2 y2 im assuming its not tail recursive because the memory of x2s value must be kept when doing the second function call in place of the second parameter and so you cant delete that stack frame
student,for the following piece of code sitemarrayiprice do i have to dereference the whole thing in order to use the actual price or can i just it like that
student,option 1 this is a segmentation fault because it accesses data in some random place right true option 2 pointers are passed by value because they contain an address the object referenced to is passed by reference false option 3 its a constant pointer to an int so the pointer cannot be reassigned true option 4 its a constant pointer to an int so the int can be reassigned false option 5 false check definition of null pointer option 6 i dont understand this one and here is my logic behind it please correct me arr 3 from what i understand arr 3 will just increment the value of the element in index 0 by 3 and i dont know what the does because it doesnt return an address so would it be false with this reasoning i get only 1 and 3 as being correct
student,my code has a run time error when it runs to outcount inij i really cant figure it out thanks so much for any help
student,problem 1d on the spring 2013 midterm exam gives int c b as one of the lines of code snippet we are to assess to determine whether a compile error occurs i understand that c is a reference does this assignment mean that c will take on the address of b and will be an acceptable assignment where b is just a fundamental data type that is without b given as a pointer c will take on the address of b and can be dereferenced to give the value at b
student,i missed the review today
student,is b return fnfnx y xy tailrecursive
student,for the problem 3 strings in the spring midterm i see most of the space is left for substitutechar but are we allowed to write and call helper functions as part of the solution to this problem eg int getstringsizechar sd void writeonposchar ptr char sd thx
student,when can we expect the video recording of professor prakashs lecture to be posted from today
student,when can we expect the video recording of professor deorios lecture to be posted from today
student,suppose struct waterbottle has a double containing a height and a string containing the brand name in memory each object in a new array of waterbottles would have these two member variables if this is correct how would an array traversal with pointers deal with this wouldnt incrementing the pointer accidentally get into the member variables by accident how would i know the size of the struct to tell the pointer to increment the address by the correct amount thanks so much
student,can an int pointer point to a double can a double pointer point to an int
student,could someone just explain a little bit more about ifstream and the syntax of whilefh what this means overall just review this problem because i am lost on it
student,ca i get some clarification on when i would be using notation such as triangletriangle or double trianglearea is this notation only needed when implementing a function in a class that has been declared in separate h file if i have a triangle t when can i just use something like tarea
student,is this true pointers are passed by value but the things they point to are passed by reference
student,since we already set by using rectangle double ain double bin aain bbin why we also need a set function this is on the review section blue slide
student,what do you guys think of this implementation for problem 3 does it work is there a more efficient method void subtitutechar parameters const char pointer s char pointer2 r whilepointer ifstrcmppointer c 1 r strcatr p pointer2 strlenp 1 else pointer2 pointer return
student,ive been writing and implementing the code over lecture and for some reason the dynamic and static example code doesnt work when i type it in what could be my error i have the function in cpp file as static triangle gtriangle345 static isosceles gisosceles112 triangle askuser cout triangle isosceles or equilateral string s cin s if s triangle return gtriangle if s isosceles return gisosceles cout unrecognized shape s n exit1 triangle askuser in my header file
student,for this question i got my socultion as 12 34 45 67 87 but found out the answer is 12 12 12 12 12 can anyone explain why
student,for this question the second line is supposed to be 10 9 3 4 but i have no idea how they arrived at that answer
student,after the p1 7 and p2 4 why isnt 7 and 4 in p1 and p2s box respectively
student,if i want to declare a cstring should i use char or char as data type what is the difference in using these two thanks for any help got really confused about cstrings
student,is this the correct output for this question
student,can you initialize a pointer without assigning it a location for example char ptr
student,in this question in is a pointer to an array of constant chars does this mean that each string is contained in one space in the array or does each individual letter of the string take up one space in the array for example does in1 hello or in1 h also how does the fact that in is a pointer affect this problem as compared to if it was not a pointer in the solution of the problem
student,would this count as array indexing referring to question 5a for int i 0 i scursize i …sitemarrayi
student,hi in the while loop whiles where s is a pointer to a cstring we simply check if s is not null we will go into the while loop what if we want to check the opposite if s is null can we use while s thank you
student,int fnint x double y if x30 return x x would return fnx y make the above function tail recursive from what i understand about tail recursion the function call must be the very last step for it to be tail recursive and this is the only return answer that seems to do this but im unsure thanks
student,how do we know when to write the cpp code or h code of a class if asked to write functions on the exam i went through lecture 9 and 10 and it seems like it was inconsistent between the two lectures of code in the h files and cpp files for example lecture 9 does not have the scope resolution when writing a function in the class itself if a question asked write the default constructor for the triangle class which would be correct triangle a 0 b 0 c 0 triangletriangle a0 bo co the first choice wouldnt be code in a cpp file because it does not have the scope resolution correct
student,can anyone share how to do this problem i cant get it
student,when we need to return both the left and right subtree in a recursive tree function what is the difference between using and for example in question 3b on fall 2013 the return statement includes a how does this work with bools and why would we use this versus
student,would there be subtype drived classes related problem in exam both practice exams have problems such as write parallelgram etc just want to make sure
student,the midterm will only cover up to and including the first 10 lectures adts correct sorry if this has been asked before
student,what does int aref a0 mean asumming a is an array and a0 is some int at index 0
student,im confused on how to write the default constructor with the initializer list do i do shoppingshoppingcart itemarraymaxsize0 cursize0
student,say you have void func int ptr ptr ptr ptr int main int a 5 4 3 int p a int pp p funcpp from my understanding this function will change the value of a0 to 6 and change the pointer p in the main function to point at the second value in the array a but not increment the pointer pp in the main because func makes a copy of this variable is this a correct way to interpret this program
student,if we have questions about lists and trees on the exams will we be given the other functions such as listmake listfirst etc that we can use
student,i have tried to write my own code for traversing an array of c strings and printing out every element i have not been able to figure it out my self and i was wondering if anyone wanted to help me out with this one
student,this is for problem 1d of the fall midterm
student,will midterm cover typedef
student,
student,im assuming that were expected to use initializer syntax for the constructor as of right now i have class parallelogram triangle t public parallelogram ttriangle parallelogramdouble a double b double theta ttrianglea b sqrtaabb2abcostheta rest of code are these constructors both valid i wasnt sure if we could call other constructors in a constructor definition
student,the question asks to define the default and custom constructors for shoppingcart using initializer syntax wherever possible for the custom constructor i ran into some trouble since arrays cannot be set to each other i used shoppingcartgroceryitem items int size cursizesize for int i 0 i size i itemarrayi itemsi can you use initializer syntax for only some of the variables and initialize the rest normally as i did above is there a better solution
student,this for 1b of the spring midterm
student,what is the answer to 1h in fall 2013 i got 44 55 thanks in advance
student,whats the policy on using sizeof function measures the amount of space its argument takes up on the test
student,can someone help me with this problem fall midterm 2 im not sure how to start it and what the general process for solving everything in it should be
student,string filename hellotxt ifstream fin finopenfilenamecstr why do we need the cstr i think it compiles without it
student,is the output of the inorder traversal tree 7 1 8 11 2 10 6 4 12 5 3 9 screenshot20140226at114656ampng
student,would sitemsarray be equal to the value of itemsarray as a pointer not as itemsarray0
student,i am having trouble understanding what exactly typedef does in which lecture was typedef covered
student,are we allowed to use for loops to traverse by pointer for instance forint i p i p size i do stuff
student,hi so im having problems understanding how i would print out every character 1 by 1 in an arrray of c strings for instance const char foo cat dog human for char ptr foo ptr foo size ptr cout ptr this only prints out the first letter of each of the 3 words would i need to use another nested for loop
student,is this generally the bestsimplest way to traverse int arrays and cstrings respectively using traversal by pointer int asize forint i a i a size i cout i endl char j whilej cout j j
student,your welcome for lowering the curve
student,i know this is right after the exam and everything but i was wondering when we should expect the results back im assuming it wont be until after the break and will solutions be posted
student,the deadline for dropping a course and receiving a w on your transcript is march 21 you drop the class and get a w on your transcript but it a lot better than failing you can always retake the class later if you so chose but the w wont go away if you are really struggling it might allow you to do better in your other courses lsa httpwwwlsaumicheduumichstudentshomeacademics20and20requirementsacademic20calendars1314calendarpdf engineering httpwwwenginumicheducollegeacademicsbulletincalendar2013deadlines i suggest talking to the teaching team a umich adviser and your friendsfamily it will all be okay this is just a single exam in one semester of your life you wont even remember this exam or this class in a few months
student,does eecs 280 offer a grade of a if so what are the criteria for obtaining an a
student,just wanted to ask if the gsis or ias will be around on piazza to help with p3 in the next week over break in case you are thanks in advance
student,what should be output if a march and a euchred occurs
student,im running a diff test on my output and im getting an error everything matches except i have a a blank line on line 1 whrere the correctout has euchre packin shuffle 10 alice bob cathy drew on line 1 is the command line supposed to be in my output
student,is there an endl after alice and cathy win or does that not matter
student,i have been to a couple dropin tutoring sessions and i was wondering if it could be made easier to locate them or see if the tutor is even here i dont know how it is at the blue apple but in the ugli basementbut i spend 20 minutes looking for them or waiting for someone who inevitably doesnt end up showing there used to be a sign for eecs 280 but that disappeared could there be a name or specific location given in the basement to find the tutor i would appreciate this a lot
student,will there be any special office hours held tomorrow night i know some gsis usually hold them on mondays but i saw on the google calendar that none are scheduled for tomorrow evening
student,just to clarify are we allowed to bring a 1sided handwritten note sheet to the midterm thanks
student,hi im confused about how to initialize the array for the default constructor i read that we cannot initialize an array using initializer syntax when we are trying to set it equal to another array but is that also the case for the default constructor since we are initializing it to be empty also i was confused if by empty it was meant to be it was an array of max size filled with uninitialized groceryitems or if that meant that it would be size 0 im guessing the former right
student,im looking through the fall midterm and i see that for the class constructor problem it says that in order to recieve full credit you must use intializer syntax what exactly is meant by intializer syntax i usually just use the equals operator to set the variables in between the curly braces
student,i know that options 1 and 3 are almost the same in that 1 accesses what the pointer points to and then moves the pointer to the next element while option 3 accesses what the pointer is pointing to after moving the pointer to the next element thus both options are wrong that leaves me to conclude that options 2 and 4 are correct because in 2 the value of the object pointed two is incremented by 1 and same with ptr because id assume ptroption 4 ptr ptr option 2 is that logic sound or is there some order of operations im missing
student,im confused about where implementations go if a class is created and defined in the same cpp file as is the case for the class parallelogram on the spring 13 midterm the question says to hide implementation details and expose only the interface using public and private does this mean that function declarations and brief definitions such as return area should be public while function definitions should be private most of my confusion derives from the fact that in class we were shown taught to create classes using a h file and a cpp file together conventions for creating a class all in one cpp file are not clear to me thanks in advance for your help
student,requires row points to an array with at least size elements effects the order of elements in row is reversed for example 0110111101 would become 1011110110 void fliphorizontalint row int size task 2 your code here i stuck on this problem can someone give an idea of how to use traversal by pointer for this function
student,im a little confused as to what pp x means
student,i found a problem about trees and cant figure out a good solution siblings in a tree is the numbers which have the same level how can i find the siblings in a tree given a number which is in the tree
student,can someone help me with the general process of doing these types of problems fall midterm 1 part e im not really sure how to get startedthanks
student,would a function that returns funcname x y be considered tail recursive how about a function that returns x y
student,if you had a class that had an int double array char and some struct that contained two ints as its member variables which of these could you initialize using an initializer list within the constructor
student,does every element in left subtree must be smaller or equal to the topest element
student,if we fix the previous lines in question 1d how does line 6 work wouldnt there be an error because ptr is the address of a and if you dereference the address of a you get an int which is not of pointer type double a 2 double b 4 double ptr a double c b ptr 5 double ptr2 ptr
student,how to interpret the following double var int thanks for the help
student,whenever i try to implement a solution i cant get around the fact that s is declared constant i tried looking at several of the solutions on the google doc and found those had similar issues i keep getting the error invalid conversion from ‘const groceryitem’ to ‘groceryitem’ when i try implementing anything along the lines of groceryitem current sitemarray can someone give a correct solution or explain a way around this issue groceryitem result sitemarray
student,so i was looking at the fall practice exam question 1 if i have return fnfnx would that still be tail recursive
student,at one of the review sessions the solution to the second part of this question was shoppingcartgroceryitem groceries int size cursizesize for int i 0 i size i itemarrayi groceriesi but isnt this solution incorrect because i thought that if you were to use initializer syntax that you had to initialize the variables in the struct in the order they appear struct shoppingcart groceryitem itemarraymaxsize int cursize so wouldnt it assign size to itemarray
student,is number 3 tail recursive
student,im a little confused as to what it does
student,hi i found out after the exam that you had to write your username on the top of every page i wrote my name on the topof just the first four pages and stopped is there a penalty for this
student,so about the midterm exam is the mean going to be curved to b or b or c thanks
student,will the exam answers be posted online also will we be getting our exams back in discussion
student,can someone explain why a is not correct when i wrote it i get the sum 10 instead of 8
student,just to be clear c strings end with the 0 sentinel value but c strings doesnt need to be so right thanks
student,why can i not use void type for the main here compiling error bash41 g pedantic wall werror springcpp o spring springcpp7 error ‘main’ must return ‘int’ complete codechanged from the correct template code for q1 spring midterm correct xcpp modify to introduce errors include iostream include string using namespace std void mainint argc char argv for int i 0 i argc i cout argvi endl return 1 whether it has this return statement or not doesnt change the error message
student,why must the second argument be an array of cstrings why cant it be just one cstring pointer for example im having trouble understanding why option 4 is wrong in question 1a the second parameter is a character pointer so basically a word
student,is there a difference between const char s eecs280 and const char s eecs280
student,when do we use strcpy as opposed to the c way of doing the same thing for example in the spring 2013 exam problem 3 vidal used strcpy in his code but in the fall 2013 exam problem 4 vidal did not use strcpy in his code both of these problems are cstring problems however one exam says do not use standard cstring functions but its a cstring problem
student,im having trouble understanding what he void add second function and the typedef void functions do the syntax is really confusing and i dont know what theyre taking in
student,can someone clarify the solution to 1i i believe the answer to be e and g however on the google doc there is substantial support for a which i believe is wrong answer a states thingptr myints nummyints 1 my reasoning is thingptr myints already is already an integer thus integer nummyints1 is a random memory location x
student,3 dowhile15­1 what exactly does the code 15­1 mean its doing 1 modicum 5 then not exactly sure how to break the rest down
student,am i supposed to do custom constructor like parallelogramdouble ain double bin double thetain
student,hi im implementing the function gameplay right now after i call playerplaycard to select the next card to play i believe the card played has to be removed how would i go about removing it and also i implement the removal of the card in gameplay not playerplaycard right
student,can we assume the command line arguments for euchrecpp come in the correct order ie executable pack shuffle etc or should we account for the possibility of arguments coming in a different order ie executable shuffle pack etc
student,i noticed that on the submission document online we were only allowed to choose one option but i think 124 and 5 cause an infinite loop 2 do i 0 while i doesnt this keep setting the value of i equal to 0 and incrementing it to 1 4 forchar i 0 i 10 i the value of i will always be less than 10 because it keeps decreasing so this is infinite 5 the function keeps calling itself so isnt that infinite too can someone correct me thanks
student,what was the average score for project 2 is it bad if we didnt score a 100 in eecs183 anything below 100 was unacceptable
student,im just venting i love coding i am very frustrated right now im coding in visual studio which doesnt allow me to use any version of strcpy even if i eliminate preprocessor definitions for crtsecurenowarnings also my code compiles fine with vs but when i transfer to caen i receive errors for the following cardcpp57 error ‘r’ may be used uninitialized in this function cardcpp58 error ‘s’ may be used uninitialized in this function these variables are not uninitialized as if coding isnt tedious enough just needed to vent im not sure what to do though so im giving up for the day
student,i went over the lecture slides on pointer arithmetic but im a little confused as to how pointer arithmetic works for packdealone packdealone is supposed to return the next card and increment the next pointer so that it points to the next next card in the pack how do i get the address of the next next card in the pack i tried card1 but that doesnt work any help is appreciated
student,i was reading the course syllabus and it was not clear as to whether notes are allowed during exams is it allowed
student,on project 2 i lost two points on rme clauses and received the following feedback rme clauses most comments better to fill in all rme clauses im trying to figure out what this means using the way the rmes were done in the p2h file as a model i didnt always include the requires or modifies clauses if they seemed trivial for example in a function that just returns the sum of two integer inputs it seemed unnecessary to state that two integer inputs were required and that nothing was modified should i have included those clauses anyway or is it possible that i lost points for something else i didnt need to include rme clauses for the functions already declared in the header file right for reference in future projects id just like a little clarification on exactly whats expected for these rme clauses thanks
student,for when i am comparing the suits and checking if either card a or card b is a left bower i want to assign asuit as trump but because it is const card a it wont let me is there an alternate method to change the value of something that is readonlyconst thanks
student,hey when calling hand in playercpp playerptr hand it says use of undeclared identifier hand and same problem comes with using cards in packcpp what is the correct way of calling these variables given in the h files of each thanks
student,i wanted to ask what will the midterm cover
student,im a little confused on meaning of the following lines on the first page in addition to being ordered by rank cards are also ordered by suit diamonds first then clubs hearts and spades what does that mean does it mean that diamonds will always be trump in this game thanks
student,can i only check user input in main instead of checking user input in every function for example can i just check if user typed in all 4 names in main but i dont check it in my player initialization function
student,the spec says the dealer shuffles and cuts the deck before each hand so what is the deck before it is shuffled say were on the first hand of the game the deck is going to be the initial pack described in the pack given on the command line if were on the second hand exactly what are we shuffling are we remembering the postshuffled deck before we play the first hand and then shuffling that id think were not just going to reshuffle the initial pack every time yielding the same results
student,other than taking the practice exams what would be the best way to get ready for this exam are there any additional practice codes that would be useful trying to write
student,i have never played euchre before so im wondering when the playeraddanddiscard function would be applied isnt the function only applied for the dealer during the making trump process
student,if i have a question about point deductions on project 2questions about how to fix errors for the future who do i direct them to kyle professors gsis thanks
student,i want to know what does it mean by following the suit suppose i have a hand of queendiamonds queenhearts kinghearts kingspades jackspades if the trump is spades and the leading suit is clubs shall i play jackspades or the queen
student,im looking for some clarification on the meaning of discard in a real game of euchre the dealer discard his or her card and places it on top of the three remaining unused cards where it remains for the rest of the hand should i care what happens to the discarded card when writing my code it doesnt seem like it needs any specific place so would it be okay to simply replace the card that the dealer wishes to discard with the one he or she is picking up and forget about where the discarded one goes altogether
student,i understand that you can initialize a pointer to another variables address using and that you can get the value of what the pointer is pointing to using the dereference operator however i am confused with howwhen you should use the dereferenceaddress of operators when working with structs could someone clarify howwhy you would use the dereferenceaddress operators with something such as packcards
student,assuming that we did everything up to the checkpoint correctly how far would we be in completing the overall project im just curious about this
student,when i test my code on caen it works fine and passes all of the published test cases but when i try to submit it with the submit280 script it says warning could not compile with cardtest00cpp warning could not compile with packtest00cpp warning could not compile with playertest00cpp anyone know what might cause this
student,i have past the public tests but theres still some compilation errors can anyone help me thanks error status you had one or more compilation errors on the published test cases of the cases that compiled you had zero diff mismatches on the published test cases files compileout cc1plus warnings being treated as errors tmpsubmit280xinchens5720playercpp in function ‘makeresponse playermaketrumpconst player const card player int’ tmpsubmit280xinchens5720playercpp58 error extended initializer lists only available with stdc0x or stdgnu0x tmpsubmit280xinchens5720playercpp76 error extended initializer lists only available with stdc0x or stdgnu0x tmpsubmit280xinchens5720playercpp81 error extended initializer lists only available with stdc0x or stdgnu0x tmpsubmit280xinchens5720playercpp86 error extended initializer lists only available with stdc0x or stdgnu0x
student,what is the difference between these two when i use strcmpargv 2 shuffle its fine but when i use strcmpargv2 shuffle i get an error thanks for any input
student,if we listed the cards in pack like this 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 and we did the given shuffle and cut three times wed end up with 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 0 1 2 3 4 as you can see the first five cards are placed at the end can we implement a shortcut to achieve this same result without doing the cut operation 3 times thanks
student,ive seen this answered by a student before but id like to get this answered or endorsed by an instructor if possible will our cardcpp packcpp and playercpp be graded beyond compilation and running the test cases or do they only need to run the published test cases for the checkpoint
student,when i try to run my cardcpp it says that in the t string2enum function it reaches the end of a nonvoid function i used the slides and return in the for loop but for it to compile do i need to return something outside of it what do i need to return because it has to be of type t
student,while making do we consider the trump suit that is the suit of the upcard when we find the lowest card in the implement the function playeraddanddiscard
student,just checking i can submit my files using submit280 multiple times right i submitted my cardcpp and packcpp but not my playercpp can i submit all 3 together sometime later before the deadline thanks
student,on slides 68 of the lecture slides from february 5th professor deorio went through an example with the atoi function on slide 7 he indicates that we are interested in writing a program that is given a list of integers as its arguments and prints out the sum of those integers he says that before we can write such a program we need a way to convert from cstrings to integers and i am wondering why this is the case do integers ie a list of integers correspond to cstrings i miss the gap where he explains the connection between his argv he used in the previous slide to indicate the array of arguments that are passed to a program for execution as cstrings he uses that same array in the example so i dont understand the connection ie why those pointers to const char are being converted to integers maybe it is just because he was working with that array and decided to use it i also dont understand whether the atoi function converts only a pointer to a const char to its int value or whether it accepts a pointer to a const char as its argument and returns the integer value of the cstring i also do not understand how a cstring has such a corresponding integer value his example seems to indicate atoi parses only the const char each pointer points to as an integer value since i dont see how the numbers 3 10 11 12 19 can correspond to anything other than single characters and at that they dont look like ascii values of characters if they correspond to the argv he was using before since that also only had 3 elements so im confused where he got that from
student,what does it mean just use cerr or cout to print out some stuff do we have to use cstdio
student,why is it not possible to assign a const to a nonconst
student,by asking this i am not meaning how to code in a makefile i just dont know how to create an empty makefile what type is it it seems a makefile does not have any name extension should i just create a txt file and copy the code in it
student,what are the contents of a wellformed euchre pack eg for packinit function the packfilename file contains a wellformed euchre pack will the file contain an array of 24 cards with data type card or will file be in a txt format with a list of all 24 cards nine of spades ten of spades jack of spades containing the 24 cards
student,if we reach round 2 and for example the upcard is a diamond and you have one diamond and one heart in your hand which suit do you order up the spec is unclear only mentioning the case where you have only one card in you hand with the same color
student,hello i have a quick question about playerledcard and playerplaycard i have passed the test cases in playertest00cpp for both of the above functions but i have a quick question about their logic i had written a remove card function that i call in both of the above functions after calling my remove card function within both playerledcard and playerplaycard i began to fail the given case tests i had included a remove card function because if a player leads or plays a card then that card should no longer be in their hand my question is should we not account for the loss of the played card or do we account for it but just at a later part of the project thanks for the help
student,i have two questions about playermaketrump during round 2 does it matter if the player who orders up have a face card of the upcard or only of the suit with the same color ex upcard nine of spades player has king of spades orderup yes or no do we still count the bowers of the suit of the upcard as the same suit or will they be their actual suit ex upcard nine of spades player has jack of spades orderup yes or no or upcard nine of spades player has jack of clubs orderup yes or no
student,so im a little confused on how the cardcompare function with ledcard as an parameter works my understanding is that if a card that has the same suit as the led card is compared to another card of a different nontrump suit the first card will be greater even if that first card has a lower rank and suit than the second one if im not explaining that well ive written an assert statement that fulfills this situation assertcardcomparetenspades kingdiamonds ninespades clubs 0 i believe this should not trip the assert am i correct
student,how do i convert string to char how do i convert char to string how do i compare two char how do i compare two string how do i copy string to string how do i copy char to char how do i assign const char to char how do i assign const string to string sorry about so many questions but i am really totally confused
student,i think someone asked this before but i didnt see anyone answer it in playerinit what should we initialize playerptrhand to be i feel like i should not just leave the playerptrhand array alone as we should always reset it to an empty hand can someone please point me in the right direction thanks
student,having obtained code from the cpluspluscom tutorial page on inputoutput with files i have written the following code include fstreaminclude stringinclude iostream using namespace stdint main fstream is studentstxt string eachline while getlineis eachline cout eachline endl isclose return 0 its an implementation of an example from professor deorios lecture8 slides it prints the contents of studentstxt to standard output awdeorio 12345678jringenb 98765432 and it compiles and gives correct output originally however i had the following code with two minor changes include ifstreaminclude stringinclude iostreamusing namespace stdint main ifstream is studentstxtstring eachlinewhile getlineis eachline cout eachline endl isclose return 0 note the change from including the ifstream library and then the corresponding change to the object from this class that i declare and instantiate when i tried to compile this code i got the related compile errors lecture8exerciseslide25cpp7 error ‘ifstream’ is not a member of ‘stdios’lecture8exerciseslide25cpp7 error expected ‘’ before ‘is’lecture8exerciseslide25cpp8 error ‘is’ was not declared in this scope why can a declaration of an fstream object accept std as a namespace when an equally valid declaration of a ifstream object rejects one
student,i feel like my playerplaycard function is too long i passed all the tests however i feel like im spinning my wheels on this code… can someone give me an estimate of the amount of lines our code should be
student,when calling cardinit in packcpp what is the first parameter ive noticed in the cardtest file it is called like cardinittwospades but how does this apply for calling in a function thanks
student,i saw packnext in the packtest00cpp can someone explain how packnext and packnext differ thanks
student,in my playercpp program i created arrays of cards with variable array sizes to work as place holders for other cards for example int x … card a x… however when i try to compile on caen i get the following error error iso c forbids variable length array when i ran the tests for playercpp on xcode the program passed
student,im using this code inside my playerinit function strcpyplayerptrname name and it causes me to get a segmentation fault every time i try to initialize a player using gameinit and calling it in gameinit through playerinitgameptrplayersi playernamesi i dont understand how else to initialize the memory location of gameptrplayersiname is there any way to fix this thanks
student,so im rather confused about what goes on in round 2 lets say hearts is the suit of the face card each player can either chose to pass or order up but they have to order up the diamonds in this case right and if were in round 2 and get to the dealer then the screw the dealer variant comes and he has to order up diamonds right i feel like im not understanding this correctly as in the second round no matter what the trump value is going to be suitnextfacecard is this correct
student,is it possible to run the gedit gdb with multiple files at once such as packcpp and packtest00cpp if so how how do you initialize gdb to do this
student,are there any key differences that can be pointed out i passed all the test cases in xcode and when i transferred over my code exactly onto my caen account and tested with linux i got a few errors i have since been writing my code in different ways to try to make it compatible with g but im basically guessing and checking its frustrating because i dont know exactly what im looking for to change since i dont have any reason to believe xcode and g are that different thanks in advance
student,can anyone give me some hints i am able to get to the right location in card using some loops but im not sure how to go about changing card using pointers thanks
student,i want to understand something basic about pointers as they might be used in our cardcpp file const char ranknames is an array of pointers to constant characters why does a pointer to a constant character print to standard output as a character i thought that pointers were variables that were used to hold the address of whatever value that they point to so do i understand correctly that if we print such an address to standard out it somehow appears as a character namely here the first char of the cstring to which each pointer points i have some code cout ranknames2 endl cout ranknames2 endl whose output is simply ranknames1 f because the the pointer in the 3nd element of the array pointers to the cstring four corresponding to the third enumeration of the ranks of the cards in a euchre deck but i dont understand why this is so
student,what is the difference between these two can i use them interchangeably
student,what would be the correct way for passing an array of cards into the cardprint function ive been trying things like cardprintcut13 where cut1 is an array of cards even though cut1 is much longer than three elements im getting seg faults
student,im not really clear on how to return a makeresponse struct in the player make trump function what is the format for example would it just be return true suit

student,what files should i include by default for the playercpp and packcpp files include iostream obviously and probably their own header files and cardh and packh for player but other than that
student,hi when i diff these two files the only difference i am getting is that at the beginning of euchretest00outcorrect there is a line at the very top that says euchre pack noshuffle 1 alice bob cathy drew this is the same case with euchretest01outcorrect this is causing my tests to fail and i am unable to submit my files because of it how do i work around this
student,im having an issue with incrementing the next pointer like someone suggested in another thread im using packptrnext to increment but it seems to be skipping a card it passes the first deal one case but fails the second since it goes to jack of spades instead of ten of spades any insight would be appreciated
student,in the lecture 11 slides it is stated that protected members should not be used citing an example in which a b and c are declared as protected members in the base class and acute is declared as a private member in the base class why cant acute also be declared protected the explanation that the professor gave during class for this question was rather handwaving implying that protected members are somehow undesirable whats the actual reason for this

student,can we assume that different players will have different names im asking because i want an easy way to tell whether a given player is the dealer or not
student,when i am using pack init my file opens and it reads in all the cstrings it needs and it will compile without a problem but nothing initializes when it is passed through card init it fails on the first test case and even when i try to print out what i should have been initializing using cardprint i only get segmentation failures so i cannot even see what is wrong what could be going wrong that my code refuses to initialize anything in packptrcardsi
student,i m still confused about card comparing so i ll give an example to explain my confusion as following suppose trump is heart the leading player plays 10 of spade and the second player does not have spade and plays 10 of club which one is greater in other word does the leading suit or the diamond club heart spade ordering take precedence in comparing cards
student,the following code works fine card firstcard packcards0 when i print the card i get nine of spades which i should but with card firstcard packnext i get ace of hearts hmm with further testing i realized my cards array is this nine of spades ten of spades jack of spades queen of spades king of spades ace of spades nine of clubs ten of clubs jack of clubs queen of clubs king of clubs ace of clubs nine of hearts ten of hearts jack of hearts queen of hearts king of hearts ace of hearts nine of hearts ten of hearts jack of hearts queen of hearts king of hearts ace of hearts so im guessing i must have done something wrong with file io though i have no idea but why do i get different values for packnext and packcards0 it may be worth noting i also get ace of hearts with packcards23 and packcards packsize 1 packcards packsize 1
student,im trying to test my packcpp file against the test file and there is an issue with the line where card lastcard is initialized the first time the line packcards packsize 1 is used i am getting a sort of a offbyone error when cardcompare is called instead of it being ace of diamonds it is two of spades the other end of the enum spectrum but the second time packcards packsize 1 is called it has no error im not sure where the error is the other 7 assert calls works but this one
student,i think i might have found a bug in the original int cardcompareconst card a const card b which is already implemented for us since this function only checks for suit and rank with suit being ordered by diamonds first then clubs hearts spades shouldnt the following be 0 cardcomparequeenspades jackclubs if so the formula that has been given to us is wrong because this gave me 0
student,are we graded based on whether we pass only the published test cases or also on whether we pass some other test cases for the checkpoint
student,little confused about how to implement playermaketrump mostly because of a lack of familiarity with euchre i understand that a player can either choose to order up and accept the trump suit or pass in the first round and they can do whats specified in the spec for the second round are we supposed to be accepting user input at this point for whether or not they pass or order up or is there some stipulation in the game strategy that will allow us to know which move a player will make anything helps
student,how do you access and initialize bool ordeup and suit trump when making this function
student,void playeraddanddiscardplayer playerptr const card upcard card playerleadcardplayer playerptr suit trump card playerplaycardplayer playerptr const card ledcard suit trump i am having trouble with these last three functions of playercpp all three of these require me to compare all the cards in the players hand to make a decision of what to return i am stuck on how i should go about comparing each card with one another ive tried having temp hands to temporarily store appropriate cards for each function and then repeating the cycle to eventually narrow the option to one card but that seems like i am over complicating the functions if anyone could give me a hint on how to start any of these functions that would be of great help thanks
student,i got this after i compiled packcpp with command g pedantic wall werror o1 packtest00cpp packcpp o packtest00 can someone tell me how to fix it thanks for any help
student,so when a player wants to order up a card does he discard the lowest card of his hand or can he also discard the upcard
student,im confused as to when the player would play a trump card in the playerplaycard function because the player is either playing the highest lead card or playing the lowest nonlead card would the player only play trump cards if the led card was trump
student,for packinit we are told to cout an error message if the io fails but does not specify what the error message should say for fear of failing the grader with the wrong output what should our error message look like
student,is it safe to assume that player names will be unique in project 3 ie can i identify a player by hisher name or could there be two players named alice thanks
student,in this test file cardtest00cpp i think there is an error on line 111 assertcardcompareacediamonds jackdiamonds nineclubs spades 0 i believe that should return a negative number because the acediamonds is not trump and does not follow suit of the ledcard so it should say assertcardcompareacediamonds jackdiamonds nineclubs spades 0 is this correct
student,just to clarify am i allowed to use the strlen function found in the cstring library i want to use it to get the length of the players name for playerinit
student,how should we go about deleting the card from the players hands when heshe plays the card
student,can we compare one enum with another for example enum month jan feb march and then enum classeecs280 calc stats if eecs280march
student,with regards to the playerinit function what does an empty hand look like it is my understanding that hand is an array of constant size so what takes the place of each location which would usually hold a card thanks
student,do we need to worry about style at all for the checkpoint ie adding commentsrmes
student,my cardcpp passes the test case without any errors however when i try to run cardcpp and packcpp together using g pedantic wall werror o1 packtest00cpp packcpp cardcpp o packtest00 i get very strange errors that says i have multiple definitions the errors are below what could this be caused by tmpccf28o47o in function cardinitcard rank suit cardcpptext0x0 multiple definition of cardinitcard rank suit tmpccfomoe8opackcpptext0x0 first defined here tmpccf28o47o in function cardisfacecard const cardcpptext0x6 multiple definition of cardisfacecard const tmpccfomoe8opackcpptext0x6 first defined here tmpccf28o47o in function cardisrightbowercard const suit cardcpptext0x12 multiple definition of cardisrightbowercard const suit tmpccfomoe8opackcpptext0x12 first defined here tmpccf28o47o in function cardinitcard char const char const cardcpptext0x4b multiple definition of cardinitcard char const char const tmpccfomoe8opackcpptext0xbe first defined here tmpccf28o47odata0x20 multiple definition of ranknames tmpccfomoe8odata0x20 first defined here tmpccf28o47odata0x0 multiple definition of suitnames tmpccfomoe8odata0x0 first defined here tmpccf28o47o in function cardcomparecard const card const cardcpptext0xb6 multiple definition of cardcomparecard const card const
student,hey i have a few questions about playeraddcard 1 can i assume that playerptrhand will always point to the first element in the hand array i only ask because im not sure how you would reinitialize it if it points anywhere else in the array 2 can i assume that all cards already in a players hand are to the far left of the array that is if they have three cards then the hand array is empty in array indexes 3 and 4 3 does the card added have to be added in a particular order or just the first empty spot
student,does anyone know of a tutor still available for this semester i think ive reached my peak of learning this on my own on time thanks
student,what exactly is playermaketrump returning
student,when a templated function is instantiated at compile time because the compiler recognizes a call to the function with a given type as the template type where is the generated code located
student,i receive the following error when using make packtest00 in the compiler packcpp in function ‘void packinitpack const char’ packcpp23 error ‘exitfailure’ was not declared in this scope packcpp23 error ‘exit’ was not declared in this scope make packtest00 error 1
student,the spec states that in the case of screw the dealer the dealer will always order up the suit with the same color as the up card lets say the upcard is diamonds and all the players pass in round 1 lets also say that all the players only have black cards in their hand what then does the dealer do during screw the dealer if he cant order up a heart from his hand
student,so ive written this function to replace the lowest card in the players hand with the upcard if the lowest card in the hand is less than upcard i never added a card using playeraddcard making the hand size 6 and then discarded the smallest card in that hand is this a valid way to do this the results come out exactly the same but the rme states in effects player adds one card to hand and removes one card from hand where in my case the function serves the same purpose but doesnt physically add and then discard a card please let me know thanks
student,i am a bit confused about the pack shuffle function is it supposed to actually rearrange the position of the cards in the array or just move the pointer next
student,does the dealer pick up the turnup card at all during round 2
student,are we allowed to use memcpy in project 3 even though we havent talked about it in lecture
student,i am really confused as to how i can look at the cards in playerptrhand if playerptr is being treated as a constant in this function any tips
student,the parameters of player add and discard is simply the up card and the pointer of what i am assuming is the dealer the problem with this function i found is that the order of what is the highest card value depends on the trump and there is no way to access what the trump suit is i know that we can access the suit of the upcard but what if the first round of making happens and someone calls a different suit then i dont know how to access the called suit for example upcard is jack of hearts round one goes through and no one calls the jack of hearts so round two goes and someone other than the dealer calls up spades now the dealer picks up the jack of hearts but has to discard with the fact that spades is the trump however the parameters only gives us player and upcard so how do we playeraddanddiscard with the new trump in mind am i getting too indept or is there a way to access this trump
student,i dont understand the hint given in cardcomparesuit to my understanding we are supposed to compare the suits between two cards and determine if they are the samegreaterlarger correct are we supposed to implement anything dealing with trump in this function
student,my cardcompareconst card a const card b is the same as what was given to us asuit aranksuitsize bsuit branksuitsize but when i was testing packtest00cpp i tried to cout the rank and suit of firstcard and the rank gave me a weird number firstcard is nine of spades so the rank and suit indexes would be 8 and 0 i got 0 for firstcardsuit but i also got 2337417 for firstcardrank is there any reason it is giving me an impossible number
student,should we reset the next pointer inside of the packinit function either by resetting it manually or calling packreset or should resetting the pointer be a totally separate thing from pack initialization i might have just missed this in the spec but i didnt see it there or in the rme clauses the clause for packshuffle specifically states shuffles the pack and resets the next pointer but the clause for packinit doesnt say anything about resetting the next pointer however i cant think of a situation where you wouldnt reset the next pointer directly after initializing the pack thanks
student,my code runs successfully on xcode and linux but when i submit it it says warning could not compile with playertest00cpp can someone tell me what goes wrong thanx
student,i am trying to read in the words from the input file using the statement packfilename rank of suit rank of and suit have all been declared as strings i am receiving the error message no match for operator in packfilename rank how do i correct this
student,do we still need to write rme and comment for project 3 checkpoint
student,my playercpp seems to run fine is visual studios however when running make playertest00 in the compiler i receive cc1plus warnings being treated as errors playercpp in function ‘makeresponse playermaketrumpconst player const card player int’ playercpp55 error extended initializer lists only available with stdc0x or stdgnu0x playercpp55 error extended initializer lists only available with stdc0x or stdgnu0x playercpp63 error extended initializer lists only available with stdc0x or stdgnu0x playercpp63 error extended initializer lists only available with stdc0x or stdgnu0x playercpp77 error extended initializer lists only available with stdc0x or stdgnu0x playercpp77 error extended initializer lists only available with stdc0x or stdgnu0x playercpp80 error extended initializer lists only available with stdc0x or stdgnu0x playercpp80 error extended initializer lists only available with stdc0x or stdgnu0x playercpp84 error extended initializer lists only available with stdc0x or stdgnu0x playercpp84 error extended initializer lists only available with stdc0x or stdgnu0x make playertest00 error 1
student,having included include fstream include iostream at the top a program where i am i am testing my implementation of void packinitpack packptr const char packfilenames while using namespace std i get several compilation errors among them the largest is packinitcpp35 error no match for ‘operator’ in ‘stdcout packptrpackcardsi’ which is followed by a long segment of some scope data that i am not familiar with i think it has something to do with the namespace when you are using multiple objects of different stream classes in this case i also use fstream can someone explain to me something about namespaces
student,how much is the proj3 checkpoint worth
student,so i know that functions cant return pointers ok so is there a way to obtain a pointer for the returned object of a particular function
student,im trying to test my packinit function but i cant open packin in xcode other students saved packin in their deriveddata folder but there is no deriveddata folder in my project how do i go about finding it or adding it
student,it says variable or field packinit declared void the function is written verbatim from the header function i dont return anything so that shouldnt be the problem
student,is there a char array anywhere that has all the rank stuff like two three etc
student,looking at the specs it states that in the first round if the player orders up the dealer adds the card to his hand and discards another card do we have to make the dealer change his hand in the playermaketrump function or will this be done somewhere else
student,i am having difficulty creating my constructor and initializing the values pointer for position double xvel double yvel i think i have xvel and yvel correct but i cant figure out how to initialize point2d pointer
student,i keep getting an error expected a before posin but i really dont understand why here is what i had projectilepoint2d posin double xvelin double yvelin posposin xvelxvelin yvelyvelin
student,for cardcomparesuitjackspades nineclubs diamonds i would think that the jack of spades would be better than the nine of clubs but the test function says it should return 0 why is this
student,what are endtoend noshuffle test case and endtoend shuffle test case i passed the given euchretest00 and euchretest01
student,for functions like playermaketrump playerleadcard playerplaycard they all require to return a value for each path however what are we suppose to return if the function goes out of its restrictions i have variable of the same struct for each function the i return for every path however i dont have them initialized to anything the beginning and was wondering if there was a way to initialize them to basically null
student,if we create a variable in a function like playerleadcard to return such as card leadcard does it matter what its default value is because if the code is implemented correctly it will return the correct value
student,im still a little confused as to howwhen playeraddanddiscard works is this function called before making trump
student,hi the spec says if a player can follow suit he plays the highest card that follows suit otherwise he plays the lowest card in his hand however suppose a player does not have any cards of the led suit his lowest card is not a trump but he also has a trump card does he play the trump card or does he stick with his lowest card to give an example suppose spades is trump and diamond is led if the player has no diamonds and has a 10 of spades and 9 of clubs nontrump will he play the 9 because it is lower or will he play his lowest trump card thank you
student,we are discarding our card by moving the card to the back of the hand and subtracting the handsize by 1 to remove that last card is this an acceptable way to discard
student,im confused about what is going on in my packinit function right now we have passed the cardtest00cpp tests and have verified that the cardinit function works correctly however it doesnt appear that the cards are being initialized at all when we try to use it in packinit i tried using the scope resolution operator so calling it as cardcardinita b c but then i get an error that says cardinit is not a member of card so im not really sure what is going on there does anyone know what might be happening or if that is the incorrect way of calling the function
student,my playercpp program was passing all of the published test cases fine until i wrote the playerleadcard function all of a sudden the test for the playerinit function where it checks to see if the players name is alice was failing i tried commenting out parts of both the playertest00 file and my playercpp file to see what was causing the issue and the fault seems to be with the test case for playerleadcard my program will run fine if the test case is commented out but will fail the playerinit test case if the playerleadcard test case is commented back in the really crazy part is that playerleadcard has nothing to do with the alice player does anyone have any idea as to whats happening here
student,if i could know what character i need to add to packptrcards0 for instance to make it work in cardinit that would be fantastic
student,when the lead card is chosen does it literally leave the hand of the player who choose it
student,im getting this error cannot convert const char to rank for argument 2 to void cardinitcard rank suit im not sure why this is happening this means that it isnt seeing or isnt using the cardinit that we have to define correct any ideas why that would be happening i have included the cardh file in the cardcpp file and the compilation line i have is the following g g pedantic wall werror o1 cardtest00cpp cardcpp o cardtest00
student,my files pass all test cases in xcode but linux says no matching function to call for several functions im working in a caen environment ive included everything and use the given commands to run my files the problem persists even if i use the make command any ideas on how to fix this
student,i split my pack into two smaller packs for packshuffle is there a good easy way to recombine them into one larger pack
student,if the value of card a is greater than the value of card b does it matter what value is returned assuming the value is greater than 1 for example in one of the given functions int cardcompare const card a const card b asserta assertb return asuit aranksuitsize bsuit branksuitsize this would give an exact value for the magnitude of the difference between the two cards however if the arank is greater than brank do i have to continue with comparing the suits as well or can i just return 1
student,for the name and hand members in the player struct do we have to modify them to the appropriate length for example change the length of name to 5 if alice is the name and change the length of hand to 1 if the hand is empty if sothen how
student,player alice playerinitalice alice cout alicename endl endl assert strcmpalicename alice 0 assert alicehandsize 0 prints alice playertest pass while player alice playerinitalice alice assert strcmpalicename alice 0 assert alicehandsize 0 prints playertest0 playertest00cpp34 int main assertion strcmpalicename alice 0 failed aborted can someone explain why this is happening all i did was cout the name
student,i plan on using a few helper functions in my playercpp im a lazy coder and was wondering what the rme requirements were since this is the checkpoint do we need rmes or can i add them before i turn in the entire thing later thanks
student,how do we move the call around the table can we just do playerptr or will that result in a segmentation fault or do we have to adjust the pointer to point back at the dealer after we move around the table
student,for the packdealone function i save the next card to a variable and increment the pointer next with packptrnext but for some reason the incremented card rank becomes a very large number after running the function only once what could be happening here
student,cardcpp packcpp and playercpp all compile fine with the published test cases in linux however when i try to submit them i get error messages for all three why is this happening
student,up to which lecture is the midterm going to cover
student,when trump is caleld and the dealer has to discard a card from his hand the spec says that the dealer then discards the lowest card among his hand and the turnup so does that mean if the turn up would be the lowest card in his hand that he would discard it so his hand wouldnt change at all
student,if enums are passed by a numeric valuetreated as numbers how come i get an error when i try to set an enum equal to a numeric value such as an integer im getting an invalid conversion from int to enum either rank or suit type in my cardinit function
student,is anyone else getting errors saying that the checkpoint doesnt compile with the playertest00cpp when they submit i am compiling on linux with g via command line and i have also used the eclipse ide compiler which i think is g and it works fine additionally i just downloaded and successfully compiled with a fresh playertest00cpp on my computer any clarification with this confusion would be much appreciated
student,i tried using submit280 but it didnt seem to work i got this message after inputting the line afsumicheduclasseecs280submit280 3a cardcpp packcpp playercpp derekne error you do not seem to be submitting from caen you must use loginenginumichedu or caen vnc press any key to abort thing is im on a caen computer in the duderstadt center should i try submitting from somewhere else or
student,im a little confused as there is some discrepancy among instructor and student answers about this detail of the spec the student and instructor answer given here 775 agrees with what the spec says as far as i see stating that playerplaycard should not consider trump yet this conflicts with two other posts by instructors saying that playerplaycard does consider trump which i believe goes against the spec the last unresolved followup answer here grace tsai 741 the student answer posted by valliapa chockalingam instructor 698 i came across this issue because i thought it made sense to write this function using the last cardcompare function which is the only one which considers the led card however it also considers trump thus from what i can see from the spec it cant be used could instructors please clarify this
student,getting some odd undefined symbols and dont know why exactly i did some research online and it seems like it might be a linking error
student,my cardcpp is compiling working fine but when i try to submit through 280 it says pack and player are not compiling with packtestplayertest when i compile them it says that warnings are being treated as errors and has a bunch of lines of errors anybody have an idea as how to fix this
student,i type submit280 3a cardcpp packcpp playercpp but it shows command not found i am sure that i put them all in the folders
student,not sure if it worked but so i managed to clear 23 test cases on my program cardcpppackcpp however one of them had a small warningerror according to caen that i had to change real quick so i had a submission at 1150pm with 13 and one at 1201am with 23 just wondering if theres any leeway to where its going to accept the later submission it allowed it so im just wondering hoping not to get 5 instead of 10 for the checkpoint for being a minute late ik its worth 15 thanks just curious
student,im using the string2enum code posted in the lecture 8 slides and it worked fine in xcode and it works in the linux environment too if i remove pedantic wall werror when compiling but if i add in pedantic wall werror i get an error saying that the template control reaches end of nonvoid function any suggestions thanks
student,am i suppose to copy and paste everything from cardcppstarter to cardcpp or just the stuff i need to implement and the headers
student,in order to create an executable for a test file i have written to test my packinit function ive created a cpp file with relevant code even with cardcpp included in my call to the compiler i was getting the errors packinitcpp39 error ‘suitsize’ was not declared in this scope packinitcpp40 error ‘suitnames’ was not declared in this scope packinitcpp43 error ‘ranksize’ was not declared in this scope packinitcpp44 error ‘ranknames’ was not declared in this scope i thought this was because global constants only had the scope of the file in which they are declared so i tried to include them also at the top of my testcpp file but this gave the following errors tmpcchhk5jcodata0x0 multiple definition of suitnames tmpccmex6v6odata0x0 first defined here tmpcchhk5jcodata0x20 multiple definition of ranknames tmpccmex6v6odata0x20 first defined here does someone know where i need to include these arrays or make reference to them
student,if one team has at least three tricks and there cannot be a march should we terminate the hand early
student,im testing parts of packinit i am using ifstream and when i cout the getline i get a string of nonsensical characters is this the format or am i just barking up the wrong tree
student,hello im wondering if for playeraddanddiscard if i need to actually remove the value of the discarded card from the hand completely and add the new card to the hand with playeraddcard or if i can simply overwrite the lowest card with the new card
student,hi i keep getting a multitude of errors such as error cannot convert ‘const card’ to ‘const card’ for argument ‘1’ to ‘bool cardistrumpconst card suit’ when i try and point to an element inside of a player like playerptrhand0 i know im using the pointers wrong to preserve their pointerness but ive looked through the slides and other online resources and cant seem to figure out how to call these differently thoughts
student,i pass all tests in pack shuffle up until line 51 in the published test cpp file 50 card queenspades queen spades 51 firstcard packnext 52 assertcardcomparefirstcard queenspades 0 i do not fully understand what this is indicating is wrong with my code any suggestions would be greatly appreciated error message is access violation reading location 0x00000000
student,player test passes when i test it but then when i submit it says i didnt create the name of the player right i get strcmpalicename alice 0 failed what could cause this
student,any hints or tips on how to find out how many cards is in a players hands i was thinking finding the first hand that equals to 0 would that work
student,im guessing player 3 since the dealer is the last to go right that would make the person to the left of the dealer player 0 im just unclear about who is what player based on the spec thanks x
student,if a header file already has an rme comment before a functions declaration do we still need to add one before the functions definition in the source file
student,ive been doing all of my coding in xcode for this project and i passed all of the test cases for player however when i copied my code into a caen environment done by copy and pasting into an ssh and test my code it says that the test failed does anyone know why this might be happening
student,in several of my functions i am receiving this error i understand with the base tests these for lops with if x cnt are doing nothing but they will with different test cases how do i make it so these errors go away ps all the code compiles and passes the published tests through vistudio
student,the inclusion of o1 is literally what makes the difference between me passing every test case or failing the first one what am i doing wrong to have this issue
student,hi all thanks in advance for the help im not sure how to begin euchrecpp my instincts tell me to cin seven objects then check that all objects are nonempty that points is between 1 and 100 and that i have either shuffle or noshuffle but am i supposed to assume the rest of the objects are required to be correct is cin the best way to go thanks again
student,i think i might not be understanding a slide on lecture 10 correctly page 22 non default list initializer the slide says the order in which elements are initialized is the order they appear in the object not the initualizer list in this case if i have class day private string morning string evening string night then if i do dayday string morningactivity string eveningactivity string nightactivity nightnightactivity morningmorningactivity eveningeveningactivity int main dayclass homework sleep coutgetmorninggeteveninggetnight would the above print 1 sleep homework class what would get initualized if just initualizing in the order of the private data members 2 class homework sleep what would make sense each data member getting initualized to the correct strings
student,on the spring 2013 exam for questions 2 and 4 what does typedef do will we need to know this concept for our exam also would we have to use subtypes for question 5
student,in the second rounddoes the side of trump is the the side the first person order up btwin gameplay function should we cout like jack of spades led by bob
student,so i know that my code works i use the good old less efficient way and everything worked out great but when i use the initialization list and then compile it keeps on saying error expected before token error expected before token what am i doing wrong
student,so ive added my second constructor in my cpp implementation with the list initializer syntax i have also declared it in my header file my syntax is projectileprojectilepoint2d pin double vx double vy posxpinx posypiny xvelvx xvelvy i keep getting the error expected before token is there something im missing or syntaxwise incorrect
student,is it possible to use a global variable declared in another cpp file without including that cpp file
student,do we still have office hour from 1030 1330 today at bbb 1695 i checked the schedule very late last night and it was still here but it seems like nobody is here and the tip somehow disappeared from the schedule alright i just feel we should at least get informed if its canceled
student,hi are we allowed to add functions to set and get xvel and yvel or we are supposed to do so
student,in question 3 it says you may not declare an additional array to store an intermediate version of your result in other words the c­string must be encoded in place is it ok if i were to declare char ptr1 r and iterate that pointer because i dont see anyother way i can traverse this pointer with declaring that statement
student,for problem 4 in midterm sp13 i cant seem to implement the use of comp without passing a empty tree base checks for a empty tree and my recursion is calling the function passing left tree and function passing right tree
student,how should we go about making a return perimeter for part 5a i know in our parallelogram class we have a triangle object as a private member variable but we cant return 2 the triangles perimeter because it will double count one of the sides so which sides should we return as the sides of the parallelogram also just to verify this parallelogram class is not a subclass of triangle correct i know in the spec it said minimize the amount of code required for each member function by maximizing reuse of base class member functions so it made me think a little bit
student,is the topic of derived classes going to be covered on the midterm
student,im not doing too well on the labs and was wondering if im going to have a chance to get back my grade
student,is the following line a typo typedef comparator bool comparatorint int shouldnt it be typedef bool comparatorint int is there any other means of using typedef with function pointers
student,is there a way to use initializer syntax in the non default constructor to initialize the array
student,for the lca question on the fall 2013 midterm are we allowed to make a helper function it doesnt say either way in the directions
student,for this slide if i move the cout before the call would that make it tailrecursive
student,i cannot figure out how to assign characters from const char in to char out what i did was outindex inindexindex but this will cause a compiler error can someone briefly tell me how to modify out thanks
student,why can you not declare main to be static
student,how can a pointer be of type const int does this refer to the type const int or int const
student,can someone explain to me what do whilei51 does i dont think weve covered bitwise operations
student,hello i have a very basic question in the cardcpp file the constant variable such as ranksize was defined what should i do if i would like to use them in another cpp file such as packcpp defining the same constant in two cpp files does not work i have included cardh as my header
student,hi are we allowed to declare a local variable like an integer variable initalized to zero
student,do we ever have to cover the variant of no trump
student,cardh indicates to me there are 4 compare functions that we have to implement cardcpp however indicates that there is one compare function a void cardinit and then 2 more compare functions which is right are both right and i actually have to implement 5 functions or have i simply made a mistake anything would be helpful thanks
student,1 are we trying to compare the cards according to trump or irregardless of what trump is and if it is irregardless of trump what is the order i wrote mine addressing the following situations 1 both are trump 2 neither are trump 3 one is trump but the other isnt additionally 2 does the left bower become integrated into the right bowers suit for example if trump were diamonds and jack of hearts was inputted into getsuit what would it return
student,i am working on this project using visual studio and need to download packin from mfile when downloading i save it as packtxt because windows tries to save it as a in file which it does not recognize however this will cause a conflict during testing and submission what is the best way to solve this problem should i just use packtxt in my code for now and then change it to packin before submission
student,let us suppose we have the following code enum moodhappy sad mood a happy then the following statement would not generate a compiler error cout a 0 then why cant we initialize a to 0 in the first place without getting a compiler error
student,i understand that each compare function returns an integer comparing the index of each ranksuit but what is that integer used for secondly when we find a card is trump how i understand it is ordered first but how do we numerically express that i could add some integer value to the index but then that changes my final output but when i dont know how important that value of the final output is im hesitant to modify the value of the index say im comparing a heart to a spade and spades are trump the indexes are 0 and 1 respectively but now spades are greater in rank so what do i add some value greater than three to the spade index to ensure my output is positive
student,whats the difference between aout inputfiletxt and a inputfiletxt both work fine for me
student,just wanted a clarification of the rules specifically the making process if the first round goes by and no one has ordered up then in the second round only the suit with the same color as the up card will be ordered up so for example suppose the up card was a club if the first round goes by then it is guaranteed regardless of who orders it up that spades will be the trump suit
student,i am currently working in packinit and using cardinit to initialize each card i am getting segfaults and suspect there is something wrong with the way i am accessing the card as requested for the first argument of cardinit how do i pass the address of the next card because packptrcardsi isnt correct
student,what is the command line for copying the contents of the proj3 folder containing all the files cardh packh …etc do i have to copy each file individually for example cp afsumicheduclasseecs280proj3cardh
student,for the packinit function i use the cstr function to convert strings that i read in from the pack file to cstrings const char to be sent to the cardinit function however the cstrings being sent arent being compared properly with the values in the cstring arrays in cardcpp what could be the cause of this am i being clear
student,if the trump suit is clubs and a is a spade and b is a diamond which one has the greater value
student,should playermaketrump add the upcard to the dealers hand if playerptr orders up there is no modifies clause for this function but it still passes the dealer pointer so i wasnt sure
student,i am stuck on the assertcardcomparesuitjackspades nineclubs diamonds 0 line of the test code i dont really get why this is supposed to be 0 since spades and clubs are not trump and therefore i am interpreting that the function should return 0 since neither card is higher than the other obviously im missing something can someone please tell me what that is thanks
student,can the dealer order up in round one or will it proceed to round 2 if nobody else orders up
student,assertcardcomparesuitjackspades nineclubs clubs 0 if the trump is clubs shouldnt clubs be of higher value then spades which makes this function return 1 because b a or do i still not understand the spec
student,im not totally clear on what this function is supposed to do lets say i read in the first card the nine of spades what am i specifically supposed to be doing with that setting the pointer to equal ninespades im quite confused
student,were having trouble returning a card is there a way to take packptrnext and convert it into a card to return
student,for this function it says we are return positive or negative values depending on whether a ranks higher than b or not it says to use both trump and the suit led to determine order as described in the spec does this mean that were ranking as we would in a trick as in cards of the led suit rank higher than cards of the nonled suit so it would be right bower left bower rest of trump cards of led suit then everything remaining
student,how often do the files in the oldfiles directory get overwritten
student,for this function the rme says it returns either 0 positive or negative number but it doesnt say if its significant how large the value pos or neg is i was thinking of making a helper function for assigning int values to each suit but soon realized that for testing purposes it may matter what value is returned not just positive negative or zero
student,do we have lecture and discussion on february 17th for presidents day
student,im pretty confused how to go about void cardinitcard cardptr const char rank const char suit is uses character unlike the other cardinit function so i assume i need to use cstrings or something do i need to cin something or read from a file or do we simply do something like if rank four rank four im just looking for some directionunderstanding on what i need to to here thanks
student,can someone explain how shuffling works it says to cut the deck in half and swap the parts 3 times but wouldnt doing this be the same as cutting swapping once
student,so we take into account the trump suit for this function i have a question if we have a call to it with jackspades acediamonds clubs the jack of spades will now be considered a club but now does the old ordering of the suits still appl diamonds clubs hearts spades or is the precedence changed because of trump for example will the ordering be changed to clubs diamonds hearts spades
student,i am looking for a partner for project 3 if interested contact me aigerimbumichedu
student,so i run it through the published test case and it works fine but when i run it through any other case it messes up heres the weird part though it messes up every test case after the first but the first one no matter what you give it will work on the second time i run it im getting this really weird bug for some reason the playerptr is carrying in with it a ¬2 which makes no sense to me but heres the really weird part its not at the location given by the pointer its kind of like its appended to the end of it even if i brought that in i should be overwriting it but instead my program is just adding chars in behind it so if i coutted what my pointer pointed to before my loop and then coutted every time i added something to my pointer this is what i get with my input as bob bob ¬2 before i iterate b¬2 while iterating bo¬2 bob¬2
student,what is the purpose of having an assert0 at the end of every function in cardcpp
student,im trying to run the program for lab 5 and it compiled after i implemented strcmpeecs280 but the second i implement the getuserword function or findwordstring function i get a huge list of compile errors such as error stray ‘302’ in program it looks like all the lines it refers to are using string or some string function also it give me a compile error saying i am missing a before a cout which i have checked five times and it is there but its right after a string variable declaration i have tried even copying and pasted the code directly from the lab and i still get the same errors is it possible it is not recognizing the string librarywhat can i do to fix it
student,in lab05cpp strcmpeecs280 has two pointers to chars as input thus i assume it takes in two cstrings however in the main method of lab05cpp it calls strcmpeecs280turtlefrog using two string variables instead of cstrings on my own i tried doing char mystringhello and received this warning treated as an error warning deprecated conversion from string constant to char so why doesnt the compiler issue a warning for when the main method of lab05cpp calls strcmpeecs280 with strings rather than cstrings
student,confused as why for the final test case when the values of the cards are the same the trump card is valued higher than the led card shouldnt the led card have a higher value because it has to be played first for example cardcompareacediamonds acehearts hearts diamonds should return a positive number the test cases have it the other way around thanks for any clarification
student,what does it really mean about the midcheck point how does it will affect my final score and what kind of file i need to submit for the midcheck
student,i just wanted to ask when will they be up and by up i mean emailed to us thanks in advance
student,eom
student,if i add a static helper function to cardcpp do i need to add the function template in cardh
student,return asuit aranksuitsize bsuit branksuitsize just wondering why we multiply rank by suitsize for the comparison this is the function prewritten in the starter file
student,euchre question what is the importance of the led suit ive read in the spec that in playing you want to first drop anything of the led suit and then whatever else you have so valuewise is it the highest at any given playing round just trying to figure this out for the last compare function in cardcpp after scavenging the spec with no luck any help would be appreciated
student,for implementing packcpp do we need to do any includes for io streams or for using exitexitfailure
student,how are enums represented with in the computer as integer values are they randomnly assigned
student,is the trump suit the same for all 5 tricks
student,is there any office hour teaching euchre tomorrow i dont know how to do it
student,so ive played euchre before and i get the rules just confused with the project specs when its talking about cards are also ordered by suit diamonds first then clubs hearts spades so in the scenario where spades is trump the first card led is an ace of clubs then the next player who has no clubsspades plays an ace of diamonds does that mean that the ace of diamonds would win the trick over the ace of clubs thanks
student,may i ask how to use sublime text 2 in office hour i watched the vedio but i still dont know how to use it i find it is really hard to use linux since i can only use up or down keyboard to control the cursor thank you
student,i know its not set in stone and varies semester to semester but are there any approximate grade rangespercents needed to safely get a certain grade available at all i feel like this would really give me more peace of mind and certainty about this course thanks
student,would adding a helper function in gamecpp that removes a card from the hand array in a player after each round of play be a valid function to add
student,the submit 280 script is currently disabled the midpoint check is due the 19th i believe when will the script be available for use once again
student,say that a player does not order up a trump in the playermaketrump function does the suit trump portion of the makeresponse struct remain uninitialized
student,im trying to implement the cardinit function but im getting error messages for the helper functions i created the error message says iso c forbids declaration of parameter with no type the helper functions are supposed to convert c string entered to the correct enum i tried using both templates and individual functions for suit and rank but got the same error both times the code used for these functions is exactly the same as that used in lecture when going over enums and templates
student,i havent received my project 2 score yet what should i do
student,if the lead suit and trump suit is diamonds and i am comparing a jack of hearts and a ten of diamonds which card would i play
student,will we offer solution for the previous midterm exams so that i could know where am wrong after i do that
student,i recently just passed the given test cases for playeraddcard the next assert statement that failed was a test of playerleadcard even though i have not yet worked on playermaketrump and playeraddanddiscard both of which are above playerleadcard why did it not fail these two cases thanks
student,when i copy the directory from project3 i found this file i am wondering what is this file for the spec didnt mention it at all
student,since every cstring is an array of chars and ends with an 0 im wondering whether its true that the ascii values of all chars are positive eg a 65
student,so in euchre the deck is shuffled before every trick for our program will we reshuffle the original deck every time so that every player just gets what the player to their right got the previous trick do we save the deck postshuffle and predeal and then reshuffle and use that deck normally the order of the pack changes frequently so im just wondering how were supposed to do it
student,say we have a txt file and want to get all the integers inside and print them to the screen 1 2 3 aaa 4 5 how can we use a while loop to do this
student,hi so im a little confused about the declaration const char suitnames spades hearts clubs diamonds from what i understand this is a pointer to a const char but i dont understand how the array comes into play my main problem though is trying to use it in my code i attempted a lot of different ways to write something like suitnames1 hoping it will return spades but all i can get it to return is the character s is there a way to write the code such that i can use suitnames in a way that will give me spades hearts clubs and diamonds instead of just s h c and d thanks
student,i am not sure about the rules of making a trump 1 can dealer order up or pass in the round 1 2 in spec it is said may naming a suit so if a player wants to order up the same suit of the previous one heshe needs to choose order up or pass will the round end there
student,for task 1 int strcmpeecs280 works perfectly however for task 2 i always receive oops is not a correctly spelled word with word 1080 int strcmpeecs280 shows str1 0x0069fc881080 and str2 0x0069fc881080 however the value returns 1 instead of 0
student,for some reason submit 280 isnt liking my submit i did afsumicheduclasseecs280submit280 3a cardcpp packcpp playercpp and it comes back to me with warning could not compile with cardtestcppstarter warning could not compile with packtestcppstarter warning could not compile with playertestcppstarter but when i compiled my files in my caen environment with the given test files it compiled perfectly fine and passed the tests not sure where to go from here
student,for anyone who is working on x code do you remember where the txt file for packin needs to be saved thank you in advanced
student,the cardcompare function written by the professors include hierarchy of suit instead of just rank making it so that everyones code will return the same higher card making it easier to autograde i am implementing this in the two cardcompare functions that we have to write on our own in case we are graded on this and i assume that we have to if this is the case the functions will never return zero because there are no two exact cards same rank and suit in one pack of cards are we required to implement suit hierarchy and if so is there is a mistake in the spec
student,when we submit the three files to the checkpoint do they have to be correct or just pass the published test cases
student,ive been fooling around with using gdb to debug my euchrecpp file and ive discovered something quite interesting it appears that when you run euchre straight up with the terminal whats saved in arg is euchre packin etc but when you run it with gbd argv contains directory of file euchre packin etc so all the arguments get shifted down is there any way to get around this so as to actually be able to use gdb to debug our full project
student,i keep getting a segmentation fault when packtest00cpp sets first card packnext and im not sure why this keeps happening do i have to add code to the pack struct in my cpp file to stop this from happening
student,what does assert0 do within the function if the cards arent given a suit or rank what would assert do
student,we just need to return 011 not the differece between two character like ft5
student,how do you correctly begin a switch statement using a pointer ive been trying switchs where s points to a const char but the compiler tells me error case label does not reduce to an integer constant is this because s points to a const char and there is something about a switch statement that is incompatible with constants
student,im confused as to what values we are supposed to assign to each suit in the cardcomparesuit function for example if card a is the trump suit and card b is a nontrump suit card a is greater than card b but what value should the function return
student,so my code works ok until the one example where is compared to frog at which point my code prints a 1 instead of 1 any ideas
student,in the implementation of the functions are we allowed to use explicit strings instead of character pointers
student,theres ahh some pretty dirty words in that dictionary
student,i keep receiving segmentation faults at the line card lastcard packcards packsize 1 my code works fine for the test comparing the first card and i did seperate testing to show that the second card was there but i didnt use the packcards format something with the packcards packsize 1 is giving me a seg fault any ideas what this could be
student,i am doing with the packinit but i cant understand the meaning of card next it is said t be the card to be dealt does it mean it is the 17th card
student,im a little confused as to how these are different char x vs int y i know that int y denotes y is a pointer that is an int so the variable y points to an address of some other variable and follows it but how is char x different or is it the star is after the type as opposed to right before the variable name i recall something in lecture that suggested the two syntaxes yielded different results though i cant seem to find the slides talking about this
student,i know the spec says during round one a player will order up if he has two or more trump face cards in his hand however the spec also says in making trump a player considers the up card the player who dealt and whether it is the first or second round should the dealer anticipate receiving the up card when calling trump in the first round as would happen in real life other than this case i can see no instance in which considering the player who dealt is actually necessary obviously the dealer would receive the up card in round 1 but the identity of the dealer doesnt seem to be a factor in each players response otherwise
student,hi im looking at the restrictions list and i see on the donts column classes or member functions what exactly is meant by member functions like dont use member functions from classes inside other functions or what
student,whats higher king of diamonds or ace of clubs
student,according to the specs at the end of a trick played cards are discarded the winner of the trick or round leads the next so when a single round ends is the winner the dealer or the eldest also since there are two winners who takes priority also since we are using the same shuffling algorithm wouldnt the result of each round be the same as each player gets the same card and all of them have a dominant strategy for that set of cards thank you
student,hi for my pack init function i successfully opened the file and read the rank and suit into strings then coverting them in c strings while passing them through to the card init function however my card init function isnt able to match the correct c strings with c strings in the rank names and suit name arrays and the card init function doesnt initalize anything if i try passing values like nine spades everything works out im wondering if there is like a hiding character in my converted c string array or something
student,im a little bit fuzzy on how to assign a new value to the pointer not the value which it points to next within the pack struct im currently using packptrnext although that doesnt seem to be working is this somewhere we should use a dot operator what is the difference between the arrow and the dot operator
student,im confused about how to read in a cstring from packin i can open the file declare an ifstream fin open it using the cstr but cant read in without including string ive tried declaring const char vars to read into and that doesnt work any help is appreciated if i could do this with c strings id be fine
student,i am confused by card compare suit i can get that if a b in suit its a positive integer but what should that value of the integer be the comparecard for the rank multiplied their difference by 4 but what is the difference between a trump suit and any other suit and am i multiplying this difference by any number or can i just return 1 0 or 1
student,say you have a pointer to a card this pointer can be accessed by using the player pointer but when you pass this pointer to a helper function you no longer have the connection with a player pointer now if you can only pass a card pointer to the helper functionyou dont want a player pointer as the input can you find the exact position of the card this pointer points to in a hand for instance the card pointer points to the first card in the hand but how do you know that given only a pointer like card cardptr
student,i am working on pack cpp and when i compile it it turns out linker command failed with exit code 1 use v to see invocation cant get this btw do we need to include assert0 or exit1 in other functions
student,i ran the diff test on my euchretest01out for the ten round game and there were no differences between my file and the correct file but everytime i run my program there is a segmentation fault
student,when i try testing packcpp cardcpp and playercpp with the make command i get the error undefined reference to packinitpack char const this error appears for every function called in main if i include the cpp files in the test files it will compile without a problem is there anything else i can do to correct this if it makes any difference i originally wrote my cpp files in xcode
student,the spec states that we should use c strings to read from files and c­strings everywhere else and we cannot use c strings everywhere i am confused as to what the difference between these two are and what specifically is prohibitedallowed the lecture slides never really make this distinction clear and i want to make sure i am not using code that is c as a small example can we use the strcmp function
student,so i understand that the first dealer is the first player and do we decide a new dealer after every round
student,i failed to compile my codes in linux because i declared some uninitialized variables before loops is that okay of i declared those
student,what is the general use of the arrows for instance cardptrrank and cardptrsuit i understand that it initiallizes a card object being pointed by the cardptr to the rank and suit but how do the arrows work
student,when i try to compile cardcpp using the test file given it says theres an error in the main cardtest00cpp75 error cannot convert ‘const char’ to ‘rank’ for argument ‘2’ to ‘void cardinitcard rank suit’ i have tried playing around with the two and then it gives me the same error for the suit even though neither of those have been labeled as const char i cant figure out why this would be happening
student,in packinit my file is opens and the the variables read in values correctly but when i try to initialize the cards in the pack using cardinit the values of these variable arent being passed properly ive tried using both char and string type variables to read in data and both do but then again theres a problem passing their correct values to cardinit how should these values be passed to the function i can write the function without using cardinit but using it makes the code much shorter
student,what is the input parameter player dealer supposed to do in the make response function
student,how to get the pointer to card if i want to use cardinit or cardprint inside packinit function should it be packcardsn i got seg fault when i use this for cardprint thanks
student,what will happen if the next has already point to the last card in the pack will carddealtone make next point to the first card
student,does cardcomparesuit need to take into account the trump should it return that spades is bigger than diamonds if spades was the trump thanks
student,i have a question associated with following the suit could the leading suit the same as trump card
student,in the playermaketrump function the test tests for bob should order up spades if the upcard is a low spade are we supposed to just tailor this function to get this type of output because clearly the spec says differently about how to make trump the spec says during roundone a player will order up if he has two or more trump face cards in his hand
student,for int cardcompareconst card a const card b const card ledcard suit trump what happens when saya 9 of hearts b 10 of clubs ledcard k of diamond trump spades how do you determine whos greater when a and b are both not in the trump or leading suit
student,im lost on how to do pack reset do i need to call from the file again and find that first card or do i need to do a dot operator or point to the card thanks for your help
student,i get why packsize is 24 but why is it pack cardspacksize and not packsize 1 are we not supposed to initialize cards0
student,ive been adding my own tests onto the original playertest00 file this was working fine until recently when i was working on adding another test for the playerleadcard function i added one test to the original and it worked fine then i added another one and suddenly the test failed at the previous function test for playeraddanddiscard on the assert checking bobs hand size even stranger i added a cout statement in the code at that point just to try to get some feel for what was going on and suddenly the test passed again and its consistentwith the random cout statement the test passes and without it it fails no idea if this may be something wrong with my code or some other bug
student,i just wanted to confirm something about pointers for project 3 in cardcppstarter it is initialized as suitnames and ranknames so when we do cardptrrank or cardptrsuit it returns the value from above whereas cardptrrank or cardptrsuit would have returned the address of said value instead correct
student,for the cardcomparesuit when checking if either card a or card b is of trump suit can we add the value of suitsize to asuit or bsuit and then once again check the value between asuit and bsuit
student,i didnt see a requires clause for rotate so i was wondering if it had to be able to handle lists with zero elements my current implementation crashes on a list with zero elements because there is no first element that i can move to the end of the list if i do have to handle a list with zero elements what should i be returning
student,are we allowed to use the tail recursive list length function given in the 04project 2introlists slides
student,simple and probably silly question but i am confused by it what is an empty tree is this an empty tree 3 or is the sub tree of the above tree an empty tree
student,i am trying to compile my p2cpp and i am using the line from the pdf file g o2 pedantic wall werror o simpletest simpletestcpp p2cpp recursivecpp when i do this however the terminal says g simpletestcpp no such file or director cclplus warnings being treated as errors p2cpp in function void inserttreeint void error control reaches end of nonvoid function i am confused as to what the error means because there are no void functions in the p2cpp file also if i compile with just p2cpp and recursivecpp without the tests it says undefined reference to main what does this error mean and how can i just simply compile my p2cpp thank you in advance
student,lista 1 2 3 4 5 then is rotatelista 6 1 2 3 4 5 or 2 3 4 5 1
student,return identity if list is empty return fnlistfirstlist accumulatelistrestlist fn identity what is it about the above code that makes it not tail recursive
student,after i type in the compiler i do not receive any errors but when i type p2 i get an error saying no such file or directory after i type in the compiler am i supposed to get outputhow do i run the program
student,for covered by if you have two empty trees would that mean a covers b or b covers a false true the spec makes it a little ambiguous which should take priority or maybe im just tired and not thinking straight
student,my partner and i have finished our project and tested successfully with both the simpletestcpp file and the treeinstestcpp file but when we submitted the p2cpp file to the autograder it told us that our project had failed one of the published test cases i guess the question im asking is how this is possible are there hidden test cases in the submit280 grader which are not provided in the project files
student,since we only edited p2cpp what do we have to include in my p2cpp i have include iostream include recursiveh am i missing something to include thanks
student,do we need to add int add and int multi functions to our p2 file or was that just to use in testcase
student,if i have a tree like 4 3 5 can i asume you will not pass 3 4 or 5 as elt
student,listt rotatelistt list unsigned int n i get errors if n is greater than the the number of elements in list the same occurs for insertlist and chop but the requirements state that n must be the elements is that also implied in rotate
student,on coveredby and containedby i keep getting the above error message with all warnings being treated as errors when i compile the code using g o2 pedantic wall werror o simpletest simpletestcpp p2cpp recursivecpp however when i compile it normally using g cpp o test1 i get the right answer and it compiles with no errors ive been trying to figure out how to get it to compile using g o2 pedantic wall werror o simpletest simpletestcpp p2cpp recursivecpp but to do so i am forced to add in return null and other things that make the answer incorrect any help on the matter would be much appreciated
student,im working with a partner
student,for rotatelistt list unsigned int n do we need to consider the case that the list is empty if so what should the output be thanks for any help
student,for the optional part do we have to do it only using traversal by pointer or can we use traversal by index to solve it too
student,whenever i write my coveredby function which i call from my containedby function i get two boolean returns instead of just oneand neither are reliably correct most of the time it returns false and then true even though each statement is in a separated ifelse statement in the false return part of my code there is no recursion so it doesnt make sense to me how my code is also capable of returning true afterwards
student,slightly confused by the premise for this function if i had a full in order sorted tree of 3 rows so top is 4 and on left top is 3 left 1 right 2 would that cover a tree that is the exact same except the 1 is now an 8 i ask because the spec seems to suggest that only the first two rows matter for this function
student,currently my coveredby function is only accurate for the left branch of each tree matching because ive structured it so that it returns coveredby of the left branch before returning coveredby for the right branch when i switch the two so that it returns the right branch first it will only check if the right branches match i understand the obvious reason behind this but im not sure how to debug it both of my return statements are within an if statement checking if the element of a equals that of b any help would be appreciated
student,when inserting an element into a tree should the tree resort ie should inserting 6 into 4 2 5 1 3 result in 4 2 6 1 3 5 or 4 2 5 1 6
student,i am attempting to submit my project but i cannot find submit280 on our class directory p2cpp is in my proj 2 folder in caen but i cannot find a way to submit it what are the steps to submitting it after i am in the eecs280 menu
student,totally lost on how to do trees are we supposed to return twice for right and left how can we get it to go both ways at the same also once it goes one way im just not sure how to switch to the other way i guess i just need like one bit of logic and i think i can figure everything out
student,i am completely stumped on where to start with tree traversal can anyone give a hint without giving too much away
student,i know we have to write rme clauses for each function we write which i did but where is it most formal to put the clause ie above the declaration rme int func… just after the declaration underneath it and before the body int func rme … or in the body of the function just after the bracket int funcrme … also i copied and pasted i know bad me for doing that the p2 header file when i started so that id have the declarations and rmes but some of those rmes have long examples should we leave those in
student,do the sum and product helper functions modify my variables sum and product at the end of the function call i will return sum and product and they will be modified the slides from lecture 2 say a modifies clause identifies any function argument or piece of global state that might change if this function is called

student,when i try and submit my project a message that says warning submission does not pass one or more published test cases pops up is there any way to see which of the test cases my program did not pass
student,will 1 be considered as a sorted binary tree
student,probably a dumb question but for our project do we have to handle if the function sends us inputs that dont meet the requires clause for example for insertlist n must be smaller than the number of elements in first do we have to give an error or do something to handle it if n is larger than the size of the list
student,i just wanted to make sure if i pass an empty tree into the inserttree function with a random integer lets say 6 the output would simply be a single element tree with 6 as the top element correct visually 6
student,what time tonight will be the latest time to turn in the project
student,for the fibtail function if i created a helper and then had this line of code in my helper return fibtailhelpern fibtailhelper………basically if i called the helper within the return of the helper would this be tail recursive
student,am i allowed to implement sum by using accumulate and an addition function the addition function strictly returns the sum of two arguments therefore i dont think that addition function is not tail recursive i also have the same question about filterodd and filtereven can i write them using filter and passing it a function that strictly determines if a function is oddeven thanks for the help
student,about comments do we only need to write those clauses for helper functions and if it does the same thing as the function can we just copy and paste the clauses
student,given int sum int a int s int result 0 for int i 0 is i result ai return result and double sum double a int s double result 0 for int i 0 is i result ai return result why not do auto sum auto a int s auto result 0 for int i 0 is i result ai return result
student,according to the spec if a player can follow suit he plays the highest card that follows suit otherwise he plays the lowest card in his hand which method should we use to determine the lowest card in his hand the one that doesnt take trump into account the one that does or the one that takes the led card into account
student,when we are calling trump do we have to recognize next for example if all players turn down a club if a player calls next do we have to recognize that they want trump to be spades or should we require that they order up spades
student,for the function slideright in task02 of lab04 i know how to shift elements 0 1 2 n1 right by 1 unit using but i have no idea how to shift the nth element to the first since we cant get the value in a specific place like to get the 3rd 7th element from an array anyone has suggestions thanks
student,under effects of cardcompare the spec says to return 0 if the cards are equal however since were using suit as a tiebreaker and there is only one copy of each card shouldnt there never be a case when we need to return 0 ie two cards will never be equal
student,the spec says cards are also ordered by suit diamonds first then clubs hearts spades is this increasing or decreasing order the wording in the spec makes it sound like diamonds are the highest suit but experience suggests that spades should be highest
student,could someone explain this to me during round two a player will order up the suit with the same color as the up card if he has one or more face cards of that suit in his hand i dont understand the example that well also when invoking screw the dealer what does it mean to order up
student,so i still have visual studio installed on my computer from last semester in eecs 183 but since the semester is over my license has expired and i cant use it anymore is there another way of getting a permanent license or an extension so i can use it again
student,how should i interpret the operator
student,for the function void cardinitcard cardptr const char rank const char suit do we have to initialize a card to those specific ranks and suits or just print the rank and suit to the terminal or both
student,hello i just need some clarification on the cardgetsuit function according to the implementation the function will return trump when it is a left bower but not for right bower and other cards that are in the trump suit is this an error in the implementation or is this done as a setup for a later function implementationprogram overall
student,i tried to download the starter code from the link in the project assignment but it keeps saying permission denied does anyone know how to resolve this
student,can someone explain tome what it means need this because type of grid is int10 which we dont want int gridptr intgrid int gridptr1 intgrid1 int gridptr2 intgrid2 int gridptr3 intgrid3
student,how are we to compare suits in the method cardcomparesuits is it according to the order diamonds first then clubs hearts spades and should trump play any role in this method
student,i was unable to attend the discussion session for this one i understand pointers and loops just fine but i am not understanding how to write this for loop im pretty sure i have the logic right if row 0 cout else cout but writing the actual for statement is giving me problems i either end up with an infinite loop or one that gives me a strange output for what goes here row row size row im totally lost nothing about this in lecture recordings either
student,when i was writing the fliphorizontal function i tried to define an array in this way int tempsize but i got the error message that says iso c forbids variable length array how can i fix this problem
student,whenever i am reading in data from packin i always get segmentation faults but not sure why
student,say the trump suit is clubs does this mean that the ranking of cards goes jclubs jspades aclubs9clubs then adiamonds9diamonds then ahearts9hearts then aspades9spades
student,whenever i try to compile cardtest00cpp using the make command i get several lines of errors all saying there are undefined references to all the functions in the header file
student,in the init function in packcpp are we supposed to initialize the next pointer to the first card that appears in the file or the last one
student,i was wonderring if any instructor is still offering help for students with absolutely no euchor background missed the offie hours on thursday and friday thanks
student,under making the spec states if the trump suit is ordered up during round one the dealer receives it he then discards the lowest card among his hand and the turn­up for a final total of five cards whats the turnup
student,in the playercpp function add and discard are we to assume that round 1 was in play and not round 2 when ordering up happened
student,when i compiled the packcpp the terminal showed up several lines saying undefined references to all the functions in packcpp my command is g pedantic wall werror o1 packtestcpp packcpp cardcpp o packtest00 how can i fix it thank you
student,for the player add discard function unit test i am having trouble figuring out what the statement assertplayerhascardinhandawesomespadeshand i bob does
student,in lecture8s slides we use filestreamopenfilenamecstr to open the file we need however do we really need the conversion from c string to c string filename is a c string can we just use filestreamopenfilename
student,what does it mean in the lecture
student,does anyone want to meet up today before 5 and play euchre we need one more person
student,for the last cardcompare function which takes into account the led card and trump do we need to order cards that are neither the same suit as the led card nor trump by this i mean the order of the cards from highest to lowest suits should be trump led othersbut do we care what the order of the others are if they are neither in the trump suit or led suit
student,hey i havent played euchre in a long time does anyone want to get together and play this weekend i live in north quad so we can meet here if at least 1 person knows how to play but wants to practice and would be willing to teach others that would be good depending how many people show up we can have multiple games going choose a time that works best saturday at 4pm saturday at 6pm saturday at 8pm sunday at 2pm sunday at 4pm sunday at 6pm sunday at 8pm
student,unhandled exception at 0x00026167 in project2exe 0xc0000005 access violation reading location 0x00000000 so yesterday i opened up my project 2 on visual studio from what i remember of where i left off everything was working perfectly now the whole program is broken it compiles just fine but when i run the program i get a different output each time and the output usually makes no sense my test case for filtereven for instance says cout test for filter even endl listprintfilterevenlist1 cout endl and i will get something in cout that looks like test for filter even 2 2 even to me this output makes no sense how is the word even being thrown in there randomly whats worse this doesnt happen every time any thoughts
student,i dont find specific words about these in the spec just want to make sure
student,10 11 11 12 11 10 if so do i need to consider this case for my inserttree function
student,this might be a stupid question but i was rereading the specs and i think i confused myself about the int sumlistt list and the int productlistt list it says that it should return the sumproduct of list zeroone if the list is empty but wouldnt that just mean that the sum and product would both be zero and if the list is not empty should it just return zero also should these functions only work with list zero or list one how can we differentiate between which lists we are supposed to use
student,i am wondering in the test file can we pass negative numbers as n to the insert and rotate function and also when we are trying to calculate fib89 it got stuck is it normal or is there something wrong with the code thanks a lot
student,do we necessarily have to use coveredby in containedby because i couldnt find a way to define it but everything seems to work fine with what i have for containedby
student,i keep getting this error when i try running the filtertestcpp file and i am not sure what i have done wrong if someone could help me that would be great filtertestcpp filtertestout p2cpp p2h recursivecpp recursiveh bash41 g o2 pedantic wall werror o filtertestcpp p2cpp recursivecpp usrlibgccx8664redhatlinux447lib64crt1o in function start text0x20 undefined reference to main collect2 ld returned 1 exit status
student,when compiling in linux i get the following errors p2cpp in function ‘int accumulatevoid int int int int’ p2cpp59 error ‘accumulatehelper’ was not declared in this scope p2cpp in function ‘void reversevoid’ p2cpp79 error ‘reversehelper’ was not declared in this scope and i get this error for all the helpers currently i have declared the helper functions in the p2h file so in p2h have something like static int sumhelperlistt list int total and then i write the function in p2cpp is this causing the issue and if so what do i need to change
student,are we allowed to use a public member function to get the size of a list specifically referring to the insert function
student,this might come down to not understanding how the recursion works in these but if the the nth number ie if n 5 we would be calculating f5 should this give the 5th fibonacci number starting from 1 or starting from index 0 the simple recursive version gives the 5th index ie actually the 6th number including the first 0 whereas an iterative version trying to understand how to do the tailrecursive version seems to give the 5th number thanks for any clarification
student,im stuck on how to use the covered by function in contained by my coveredby works fine when i test it but for containedby i cant get the function to output true if i have containedbya b with tree a 3 and tree b 4 2 5 3 it outputs true if a was 2 or 5 but i cant figure out what to do in contained by to go further down tree b
student,for the accumulate function is there anything special we have to do with the identity besides returning it if the list is empty
student,suppose i call a tailrecursive function as part of another function to get its return value for example int mysum summylist can i now make modifications to mysum before returning some result using that number or will this break the tailrecursion of my new function since i am not directly returning sum
student,for accumulate and filter i have made test functions to see if they work should i include them in the project to make it clear how i implemented them
student,for the functions that have unsigned int n as a parameter can we create a new function called int sizeoflistt list that returns the number of elements in the list and then just check if the sizeof is the same as the counter for convenience sake i wasnt sure if we can implement functions other than the ones given to us in p2cpp thanks
student,i wrote a boolean function called iseven that tests is the value of x is even if so returns true i set fn iseven within my listt filter function but when i call listprintfilterlista iseven it creates an error what is the correct way to call this function
student,it turns out that if the fibonacci term say 75 or so the corresponding term is very large so i am not sure if terminal will ever display it because it takes too long to process or its not within the range of bits available i am also not sure if this should be the stress case or is something we cannot account for thanks
student,i am confused on what constitutes a pointer and how they get used i am writing a helper function for use in my sum function which i want to make it tailrecursive by having it return the value of a helper function that will perform the computation of the sum i understand that the helper function needs to also be tailrecursive i thought i have understood that a good way to achieve this would be to make the function take an additional parameter and to before this calculation only as a result of recursive function calls that dont return anything until they meet a base case i was going to use a valid call to listfirst with the list from sum as an argument as this additional argument but based on the compiler messages i receive i think that any call to a function necessitates that the function parameter where it is used as an argument be defined as a pointer rather than the result of whatever the function call returns in this case the first element of the list an int however this does not fit with my understanding of pointer and so i come to the conclusion that i have no idea what a pointer is actually used for is it not the case that i have access to the listfirst function for use in the implementation of my helper function anyways and so why would i need to pass it this function
student,i am trying to debug my code using gdb ive compiled successfully using g wall werror pedantic o2 o sumtest p2cpp recursivecpp sumtestcpp and i can run the code in gdb but when i try to set a breakpoint i get the error no symbol table is loaded use the file command hence this this this indication from gdb at the beginning reading symbols from afsumicheduuserkakaisertdeecs280proj2sumtestno debugging symbols founddone i tried to use the file command like it indicated to get the symbols it didnt find any what can i do to get these symbols
student,are we supposed to put static in front of coveredby
student,are we to assume that fnidentity x identity
student,i understand the identity part of the accumulate function but i dont understand what return identity if list is empty return fnlistfirstlist accumulatelistrestlist fn identity otherwise do i return the three functions with with a comma in between i dont think this function is that hard but im quite confused about what its asking for
student,for inserttree should we be accounting for if else statements for each different side of the tree so for example we need an if statement for when x the left node and then x node on the left side and then do two more for the right side
student,im having trouble with the inserttree function we have figured out where to place the new element but not how to place it so for the test case we get 4 3 were not keeping track of the parts of the list before we added a new element how do we do that treeinsert doesnt allow you to pass an existing tree 4 3
student,in inserttree when we add a number thats already in the tree eg adding 1 to a tree that has 1 2 and 3 should it go to the left or the right of the number thats already in the tree
student,i submitted project two and got the message you had one or more compilation errors on the published test cases of the cases that compiled you had zero diff mismatches on the published test cases does this mean that because i have compilation errors i got zero points on the entire project or does this just mean that some of my functions did not compile but others are ok
student,i just found out that our final exam is at exactly the same time as my math217 class apr 28 10301230 will i be able to sign up an alternative exam sometime
student,can we just comment the helper functions or do we have to comment on every function since the rme clauses for helper functions are the exact same for the rme clauses provided to us in the project spec
student,when i write the following code i get an error that a is not a modifiable lvalue what does this mean are arrays const pointers int a 1 2 3 a
student,void strcpychar dest const char src req src is a nullterminated string dest is big enough to hold a copy of src mod dest eff place a copy of src in dest two slides after the preceding definition it is mentioned that is is still possible to change the value of src using another pointer shouldnt this be impossible since you cannot assign src to a non const pointer within the function
student,when traversal is tested two warnings appear sharedlibrary applyloadrules all warning the current language does not match this frame current language auto currently c and in recursivecpp which i did not make any alterations to highlights this line if lnplnid listnodeid lnplnid listemptyid within static struct listnode function and says thread 1 program received signal excbadaccess if this is something that would be better solved in office hours thats fine just thought id give it a shot thanks
student,do the function pointers themselves need to be tail or otherwise recursive
student,i am losing sleep over this issue my inserttree function properly travels to the correct location of where to insert the number however when it goes to insert the actual number it erases all the nodes above it for example inserting 1 into the example i get 1 1 1 it is in the right location but it has erased everything above it any advice i am at a loss i have traversal and tree sum working properly
student,when i compile my code i get this error p2cpp in function int sumvoid p2cpp28 error sumhelper was not declared in this scope this same error repeats for every helper function i wrote it seems like the compiler is not picking up that listt is a new type i have include recursiveh and include p2h in both p2cpp and my test file neither recursiveh not p2h have been modified anyone know whats wrong
student,do we need to write the helper function into p2h file if not do we need to write rme for helper function if the answer is yes where to put rme in front of the implementation of the helper function or put them all together at the beginning of the p2cpp file thank you
student,recursiveh includes rme clauses for all the functions we have to write but says nothing about helperfunctions should we include rme clauses for all the helper functions that we write im just asking because the function style guidelines document mentions doing rme clauses for all the functions we write was something mentioned in the project 2 spec about this issue that i missed
student,if we implement product and sum using accumulate we will also need to create the functions add and mult to pass into accumulate do these functions need to be recursive im not sure how i would implement the function int addint a int b recursively seeing as its body is simply return ab
student,so i wrote my entire p2cpp program in xcode which seemed to work well when i was testing it but when i transferred my code to linux and tried to compile bash41 g o2 pedantic wall werror o simpletest simpletestcpp p2cpp i get this message tmpcclf6p1ko in function main simpletestcpptext0x3a undefined reference to listmake simpletestcpptext0x4f undefined reference to listmakeint void along with the same message about other recursive functions i have include iostream include p2h include recursiveh using namespace std can anyone help me figure out what im missing thanks a lot
student,some of the function has no requirement of the input should we write code to check whether the input is legal for example what if users use inserttree function to insert a number that is identical with one of the node
student,for the chop function if we have 5 elements for example should we specify that it cant go past the number of elements in the list basically would i have to write that n cant go past 5 or is it assumed
student,is it fine style to use if x 0 return 5 return 6 instead of using an else in the second case
student,hi when i used g o2 pedantic wall werror o simpletest simpletestcpp p2cpp revursivecpp to compile i got error like cc1plus warnings being treated as errors p2cpp in function void rotate unsigned int p2cpp 130 error comparison between signed and unsigned integer expressions but i have functions listt rotatelistt list unsigned int n and static listt rotatehelplistt list listt partlist unsigned int n could anyone help me figure it out thanks a lot
student,my partner and i tried to compile our code and got this we cant figure out what is wrong screenshot20140204at52957pmpng
student,i have searched the other posts so i question would be does it considerate tailrecurive if you do something before return base case in the helper function the main calls the helper function such as int funchelperint n ifn0 int sum54 return sum else
student,im pretty sure that i am able to traverse down the tree where the element should be inserted using two recursion statements next how can i go about inserting that element at the bottom tier of the tree my first instinct was to use treemake but im confused how i would determine all three arguments please help get me on the right track
student,my rotate and its helper seem to compile on visual studio and give the correct output but the same code on linux has an error saying the control reaches end of nonvoid function ive looked at how the function runs and cannot seem to find the error is there some change that im forgetting
student,im having trouble with the inserttree function so im trying to use gdb to see where im going wrong unfortunately it skips over inserttree even if im using the step command any idea why this might be
student,does rotate have to return a new list right now my function works by modifying and returning the list that is passed in thanks
student,the spec said our functions should be at most 10 lines of code not including lines for closing brackets some of mine are still longer than 10will we be docked style points if they are that long
student,if the parent function has parameters such as listt l unsigned int n is it okay for my helperfunction to have parameterslistt l int n listt c basically im changing the unsigned int to an int since i have an off by one error and require the return case to be negative
student,im wondering of we are allowed to implement the treesum function by simply returning the list sum of the treetraversal function technically then the treesum function itself would not be recursive correct is this cheating or no
student,for the insertlist function if lista12345listb6789 when i call insertlistab2 which list is returned 126789345 or 126789543 thank you
student,how to make accumulate tailrecursive without writing a helper function any hint is appreciated
student,hi any clues to how to many it work when n is greater than the total number of elements in the list
student,should return list modify the list for example if i do reverselist1 where list 1 is 123 and then listprintlist1 should it print 123 or 321 thanks
student,i am testing my inserttree function i had a tree look like this 2 1 4 and then i inserted 2 for 3 times i got this 2 1 4 2 2 2 is this result correct can i just use listprint traversal tree to test the result in stead of looking at the graph if my result is correct why it does not look like this 2 1 2 2 2 4 thank you
student,okay so for some reason my project has gotten completely messed up every time i try to open the text file by typing vim p2cpp it gives me a list of options that include read only edit anyway recover and quit when i look at the read only option it gives me a text file full of code that i didnt type if i recover it gives me two swp files to choose from the first is under my username and the second is under someone elses i want to know how i can recover the swp file i want and compile with it normally again whenever i try to compile its giving me errors in places i didnt have any errors before and whenever i check to see where the error is its not there it seems like it is trying to compile the file of code i didnt type and wont compile my original file i have zero idea how to fix this if i go to mfile my original text file of code is there under the name p2cpp so i dont understand why it is having issues finding it in linux this is really hard to explain so i apologize if this is confusing but any help is appreciated since my entire project has pretty much been made useless
student,would it be okay to create our own static function such as listlength that returns the length of a list and then implement this function in p2cpp
student,the following is what happened when i tried to compile in linux bash41 g o2 pedantic wall werror o filtertest filtertestcpp p2cpp recursivecpp bash41 filtertest error user passed empty list where nonempty requried filtertest recursivecpp42 void listchecknonemptyvoid assertion 0 failed aborted any idea of where this error is occurring this is the test case that was given to us so i am not sure why it says a user passed an empty list
student,i try to run my code and this is the error that i keep getting can someone direct me how to fix this problem please bash41 g o2 pedantic wall werror o simpletest simpletestcpp p2cpp recursivecpp simpletestcpp8 error expected constructor destructor or type conversion before ‘int’ p2cpp10 error expected constructor destructor or type conversion before ‘static’ bash41
student,when i compile in linux with the werror included it generates a warning that says errorcontrol reaches end of non void function however i have gone through this function and i think it is saying this because my return statement is in an if statement and the compiler does not realize that this return statement will always be reached i know that it will always be reached eventually because i keep calling the function recursively until it returns when i compile without the werror included and then run the test i get the correct result do i need to worry that the autograder will have a problem with my function
student,i just implemented the traversal function when i try to compile using g o2 pedantic wall werror o simpletest simpletestcpp p2cpp recursivecpp i keep getting the error multiline comment the error is being called on the rmes below the traversal function in both p2h and my p2cpp i copied the rmes over when i delete the traversal rmes in both files the error goes away and i can compile how do i get rid of this comment without changing p2h
student,after trying to run simpletest i get the following 1 2 3 4 5 11 12 13 14 15 5 4 3 2 1 3 2 4 1 5 11 12 13 14 15 so it seems my reverse function works but calling it in append fails it appears that the first list lista reverses every time one of its elements is added to the second list whats going on here if i drop the reverse function call from append the last line becomes 5 4 3 2 1 11 12 13 14 15
student,what should happen if if we try to insert a list such as 1 2 3 into a list such as 1 5 6 8 at a point beyond the latter list such as 9
student,is this tree a contained by tree b tree a 1 1 tree b 2 1 2 1 3
student,i am trying to write the inserttree function but need a bit of help im not sure where to get started any hints would be greatly appreciated i have finished the traversal function but i dont really see the connection between traversal and inserttree thanks
student,hello i made two functions add and mult to test my accumulate functions add returns the sum of the two given parameters mult returns the product of the two given parameters when i call accumulatelistmake mult 1 it returns a 1 basically i pass an empty list to mult and it of course will return identity 1 should i figure out a way for accumulate to test if the inital passed list is empty or do i not have to worry about that thanks
student,if i have a function that calls a helper function and that helper function is completely tail recursive is my implementation of my function tailrecursive for example myfunction int x int y bool truthfulness return helpermyfunction15xtruthfulnessy
student,how do we call accumulate given the argument int fnint int
student,i get this error message in visual studio warning c4715 sumhelp not all control paths return a value warning c4715 producthelp not all control paths return a value error c4716 reversehelp must return a value
student,i have no idea what this function is supposed to do i dont understand the spec at all
student,i am wondering whether the tree 4 2 5 3 contain 4 5 and 4 2 3
student,in the reverse function i know there will be a call to listmake but it adds on the new element to the old list so the old list is on the left and the new one is on the right can it be called in the opposite way where the new number is added to the left of the old list
student,in spec it is given that inserting 1 into the tree 4 2 5 3 will get the tree 4 2 5 1 3 but according to the requirements could we also get 4 2 5 3 1 or 4 2 5 3 1
student,bc my trees werent working i copied the tree that the instructor posted on 219 treet tree treemake2 treemake1 treemake treemake treemake4 treemake treemake but it still doesnt print correctly am i missing something when i put treeprinttree it prints
student,im a bit confused about how to use lists can we access the elements of a list the same way that we would access the elements of an array
student,can the elements of a tree be a negative integer
student,what exactly does append do does it just combines both list
student,are we to assume that only the correct type of arguments will be passed in the function calls ie for listmakeint listt the autograder will pass in an int and a list and not a listt and an int bc when i was checking filtereven i put in 0 zero as an argument for the function and got a segmentation fault
student,say i have tailrecursive functions helper1 and helper2 is this definition ok even though requiredfn doesnt call itself int requiredfn listt list helper1 return helper2list
student,i am an lsa student and i took eecs 183 last semester looking for someone on central campus to work with
student,listt filterlistt list bool fnint can someone explain to me what the filer function does also can you provide an example
student,are there written solutions to the lab assignments that we could access after the due date id like to see the perfect solutions so i can compare them to how i went about it thanks
student,im a little confused on how exactly identity works in all of this i tried testing accumulate with a list 1 2 3 4 5 function x y and identity 2 and got the answer 240 would this be correct because 1 2 2 2 3 6 6 4 24 24 5 120 so does identity just implies the function with the final result from the list and its input
student,can a tree have more than one of the same number
student,for the evenodd filters do we consider 1 3 5 7 as odd numbers the computer is assuming it is not an odd number and filtering it from the result
student,so besides giving a function an input that would cause stack overflow with normal recursion is there any way to directly check if a function is tail recursive from manual checking it seems like my functions are tail recursive but if i want to be sure is there any way to access that information straight from the compiler
student,this is just for planning purposes so that i can allocate a couple hours everyday to work on the project as i usually do for projects but how long would you say the time commitment was for project 2 i know for project 1 it was 57 hours
student,will there not be office hours tomorrow since we dont have classes
student,is there a chance that the accumulate function in the autograder will have its identity argument set to a noninteger to my understanding the accumulate function has to essentially perform an operation given by argument function over the whole list until the list gets empty where the argument functions operation will be performed on the result so far and the identity for example for a fnxy 2xy the identity is 05 after the accumulate finishes performing the calculations and gets to a list consisting of result it will perform fnresult 05 im not sure how an identity that is not an integer is supposed to work in this case since any double passed into the function will get casted to an int and hence that 05 will turn into a 0 changing the whole result to a 0 as well
student,i am sorry if this was already answered all functions we write in p2cpp have the declarations in the recursiveh file if we want to include helper functions in p2cpp do we put the function declarations in p2cpp or somewhere else
student,what should the accumulate function return if the beginning list has a length of 1 for the first execution dont you have to apply the function to the first 2 numbers in the list
student,will partners receive the same grade or will each persons work still be graded individually instead of sharing code for p2 my partner and i just plan on helping each other with concepts
student,for those on a mac how are you debugging if i remember correctly gdb doesnt work or isnt installed on macs lldb is the stock mac debugger i tried looking up how to use it and found this site httplldbllvmorgtutorialhtml but ill be honest i have no idea what noun verb options optionvalue argument argument means can someone help me thanks
student,httpmitpressmitedusicpfulltextbookbookzh11htmlsectemp52 the online reading document says countchange generates a treerecursive process with redundancies similar to those in our first implementation of fib it will take quite a while for that 292 to be computed on the other hand it is not obvious how to design a better algorithm for computing the result and we leave this problem as a challenge i wonder whether there exist a iterative solution to the challenge and if yes what is the algorithm
student,could someone please provide an example of a way to stress test for long duration i dont know what this is and want to ensure my code is written appropriately to handle this thank you
student,does anyone know if eecs 281 will be offered in the 2014 summer term
student,hey just a quick question in the third lab when we modify the dst array in the void function we define it changes it back in the main as well because arrays are automatically passed by reference right
student,hello do we include any libraries in our p2cpp file currently i am trying to compile the whole group as listed in the p2 spec but the compiler doesnt recognize listt and trees can anyone help thanks
student,i was wondering if we are allowed to use the list functions we programmed for example reverse or sum in the implementation of our tree functions thanks
student,while testing the rotate function which works fine under normal circumstances i discovered the fatal error of n exceeding the number of elements in list how do you want us to handle that error should our implementation of rotate just return the given list should it return an error or should there be something like a rollover where when n exceeds the length of list just do n listlength as n
student,i feel like im missing something how are we supposed to use treeisempty if none of the other tree functions allow for empty trees i cant do treeisemptytreelefttree for example because in order to check if the left branch is empty i have to call it up and if it is empty treelefttree fails and aborts the program please tell me im not understanding something
student,we are allowed to unlike project 2 use recursion for this one right just verifying
student,im having trouble understanding what the identity does from what ive gotten from the other posts about accumulation identity is so that the value wont change at the end of the list so in the example that i saw earlier in piazza the identity for a function 2xy would be 05 the function says return identity for empty lists and this is where im confused why are we returning it for an empty list if the function is 2xy dont we want accumulation to return 1 if were supposed to return identity then accumulation would return 05
student,when ur creating a tree can you have an empty branch that leads to two nonempty leftright branches if so how would you create such a tree because treemake requires an int as its element followed by the left subtree and right subtree
student,can you call other functions in p2cpp that are not helper functions such as reverse which can be easily used for append
student,to use assert in testing whether the list is empty is the only requirement to include cassert and then calling it within a function such as assertlistisempty does assert need any type of initialization what is the correct way to call it thanks
student,when the autograder tests the accumulate function will it try to input a function and identity as parameters that dont work for each other for example if fn add and identity 1 should i worry about that happening
student,im really struggling with writing the traversal function i can get to the left most int i just cant add previous items to the list i figure the function isnt tailrecursive because we are returning a list therefore the return should be listmake…… and the base case returns a tree i appreciate any tips or hints
student,are we supposed to assume that the number of rotations cannot be greater than the amount of numbers in the list i know we need to use a new list and reverse that but if we have to rotate it more than the amount of numbers in the list it would not be logical to do a new list or reverse
student,for the tree sum function would it be okay to pass a variable that keeps track of the sum by reference into a sum helper function
student,i remember the gsi saying we cannot use for and while loops in lab 2 since we are using arrays for lab 3 is it safe to assume that we will be using for loops to modify the arrays in the dst array stupid question but just needed confirmation thanks
student,if my tree is like this 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12131415 sorry i couldnt format it well so my question is if i run the traverse function on this tree which return a list of elements from left to right what would that list be
student,i am just wondering for treesum function how could we get the values of the external node leaves since treeelt requires nonempty tree thanks
student,in the containedby function are we supposed to write a different function coveredby and call it in our containedby function im lost as to whats the difference between the two in the example 4 5 2 5 3 does not cover however they both contain the same tree
student,hey im looking for a partner to complete project 2 if interested please reply back
student,are there any examples of tailrecursive functions without helper functions i cant think of a case in which you wouldnt need one
student,i know it isnt required but i am having some trouble figuring out the fold function im not sure how to be assigning the result of a computation to the result variable works for the addition function but not for the multiplication function etc does anyone have any hints for me
student,i am confused by the specs for the traversal function 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 what output would traversal yield on a tree like this it appears that 10 is easily the leftmost value if this is true it seems like with extremely complicated trees the function would need to perform a bruteforce search of the entire tree space to for every value in the returned list
student,hi may i know what the correct output for the first task is i cant seem to find a sample output to check against i got testing map setting arr1 1234 mapping from arr1 to arr2 using triple arr2 3 6 9 12 mapping from arr2 to arr3 using addone arr3 4 7 10 13 mapping from arr3 to arr4 using comparetoseven arr4 1 0 1 1 disclaimer im not sure if its illegal to post this but i suppose not since i didnt show any of my code testing map setting arr1 1234 mapping from arr1 to arr2 using triple arr2 3 6 9 12 mapping from arr2 to arr3 using addone arr3 4 7 10 13 mapping from arr3 to arr4 using comparetoseven arr4 1 0 1 1
student,should we add effects and requires for each of our helper functions or is a brief description comment for each one fine
student,can we use counters in project 2 as in variables that are incremented each time recursion happens
student,im lost on the first function here is what i understand 1 the function receives a list 2 this list may contain nothing at all or it may contain a random amount of integers 3 the function should return the sum of all of those integers 4 the function should be implemented using recursion thats it i dont understand how to create a function that adds up values which i cannot identify can someone please explain this first function to me in terms of approach and how to handle the list
student,is it permissible to use more than one helper function per function defined in a header file the function im specifically thinking of using it for would need two helpers
student,listt rotatelistt list unsigned int n if n0 return list else return rotatelistn this function could be compiled but when i run it segmentation fault showed in terminal after i change the n to n1 this function runs well could anyone tell me why thanks
student,i am working on the helper function for the append function i currently have these cases 1 first and second are empty 2 first list is empty 3 second list is empty 4 neither of them are empty it seems simple enough but out of curiosity i wanted to know if there is more efficient way to consider cases i get the feeling this is the dumbed down version thanks
student,i am having trouble understanding how to start this function because how i am thinking of solving this is start with the left and then move to the right side but then if i start with the left side of the branch and go all the way down how do i go back up the tree and calculate the right side can anyone give me advice on how to go about solving how to do this function
student,so i understand that for project two we can write some of the functions as pointer functions with a new function such as add or multiply but we can also just write out each function individually does this matter for style
student,is 0 considered even or should we check for that
student,i am having a lot of trouble with this funciton i have looked at all the other posts and the lecture that has the hint and i have written a function that prints the numbers in the tree in the correct order that the list should be in but i am having a lot of trouble trying to figure out how to convert this print traversal function into the traversal function that we are supposed to write i cant seem to figure out how to get the numbers into a list and when i can get numbers in a list they are not in the right order and not all of the numbers are there
student,if we want a function that cannot be tail recursive or recursive in general such as a simple boolean function that checks if something is divisible by 2 can we still implement it
student,i just want to make sure that we could use for loop in the map function thanks
student,i was testing my fib function and ive noticed for any integer greater than 46 results in an integer overflow that is 47 gave me a negative result which is impossible you can see form httpwwwmathssurreyacukhostedsitesrknottfibonaccifibtablehtml that fib47 231 my question do we need to worry about inputs that result in integer overflows for project 2 for any function that we are to implement hopefully i did enough searching this time
student,hi i am confused by the the effects of the rotate function on spec it says “returns a list equal to the original list with the first n elements moved to the end of the list” but on the header file it says “returns a list equal to the original list with the first element moved to the end of the list n times” are we allowed to do rotatelista 6 if lista has only 5 elements if yes what is the output thanks
student,hi i have two questions regarding to boundary values 1 in inserttree function do we need to consider the case when the tree is empty 2 in tree related functions is it possible that the elements of a tree is nonpositive thank you so much
student,why is the following legal const char world world while the following is illegal const int p 1 2 3
student,since we are not allowed to add any functions to our p2cpp file that arent static is it true that the functions that are pointed to in the accumulate function must be provided by the file that is being used to test our functions therefore these are not something that we need to worry about other than for testing our accumulate function these will be functions provided by the autograder
student,hi im having a problem formating my output list correctly 2 1 4 9 3 7 im getting 2 1 9 4 3 7
student,im going through reversecpp to check out how the lists were implemented but i am rather stumped on what exactly is the purpose of the constants declared at the top of the file implementation of the list adt const unsigned int listnodeid 0x11341134 const unsigned int listemptyid 0x22452245 i dont really get why these would be necessary could anyone explain the reason behind them
student,returns true if a is covered by b or any complete subtree of b so if tree b is 2 1 4 9 3 7 and tree a is or 4 2 3 7 4 7 so output is true for both
student,is this the correct output i should get when using the test cases given for tree 2 1 4 3 2 1 4 3 success
student,thanks
student,when correctly using containedby would this be true or false tree b 2 1 4 3 tree a 2 1 4 7 success
student,how do you call the pointer function fn in int main filter list fn
student,i am trying to understand the spec for tree traversal if i had the tree a b c d e f g h i doing treetraversal should output d b e a f c h g i am i understanding how traversal should work
student,okay so as im getting to the bottom of the list of the functions we need to implement tail recursively and im finding myself having some pretty complicated base case returns i was wondering if that would make a function no longer tail recursive for example if i had a function that looked like this functionhelperint n string result ifn 0 return reverseresult assuming reverse is a defined function return functionhelpern 1 result would the extra work in the base case make it not tail recursive even though the return of the function helper has no extra work after it i know my example function doesnt have any real use but im not trying to give away answers and get in trouble thanks in advanced for a reply
student,how can i decide what to use for the base case of reverse i think i figured out how to reverse the order by making a new list with listmake but how can i stop the recursion with an if statement base case
student,do we have to make the fib functions using trees i wrote one of them using a list but the spec is a little unclear weather or not we should use trees for it
student,ive been reading all of the posts on piazza and saw the hint on the lecture slide but i still cant figure it out i can get it to print the numbers in the correct order but i am really stuck on how to put them into a list i dont really understand how i make a left list and a right list to append them
student,is this a well formed tree 5 mt mt if it doesnt have any children
student,maybe this was already asked but i couldnt find anything so i figured id ask what should the function do if there isnt an empty spot where the elt could fit in the case of the tree 10 5 15 20 what should the function do if you passed it 16 as the integer should it replace 20 and then add 20 as its right branch or should the function just not even bother adding 16 in
student,so im a little confused about the role of the identifier if im using the sum function do i simply count the identifier and nth1 term and do the addition one more time
student,for project 2 i can compile successfully in linux but i keep getting error message in xcode says undefined symbols for architecture x8664 accumulatevoid int int int int referenced from main in testo ld symbols not found for architecture x8664 clang error linker command failed with exit code 1 use v to see invocation i thought its something wrong with my accumulate function or test code because if i make the line for accumulate test as a comment i can compile can someone tell me what does the error message mean
student,i think that ive gotten all of my tree functions working but when i try to complie my code with the command g o2 pedantic wall werror o treeinstest treeinstestcpp p2cpp recursivecpp i get the error tmpccp06f1oo in function main treeinstestcpptext0x1c5 undefined reference to inserttreeint void collect2 ld returned 1 exit status why is this i havent changed the code in treeinstest or recursivecpp whats going on
student,i cant understand the spec about identity of accumulate function identity argument typically the value for which fnx identity x fnidentity x x for any x does it means that for example int addint a int b return a
student,im testing the chop function it exits the program at calling the chop function but i didnt use the listchecknonempty in p2cpp nor in the test code what might be the problem
student,after compiling and running my filtertestcpp im getting the following output error user passed empty list where nonempty requried assertion failed 0 function listchecknonempty file recursivecpp line 42 abort trap 6 not 100 sure what this is telling me and is there anything i can use to get some indication of where in my p2cpp to look for my mistake thanks in advance
student,what other tests are there besides simpletestcpp and treeinstestcpp
student,hello i just noticed that it says in the specs do not include recursivecpp in your p2cpp file my header currently reads include iostream include recursiveh include p2h should i remove include recursiveh
student,i tried running the traversal tree function in a test program and the compiler keeps giving me the error undefined reference to traversalvoid what does this error mean
student,im confused with the syntax of implementing the filter function i know what the function header or declaration is supposed to look like listt filterlistt list bool fnint but i dont know how to use the function pointer when it takes in a variable of type int any guidance
student,i understand that it goes against the nature of the assignment but seeing as there is nothing specifically against using binets formula would it be acceptable to directly calculate the nth fibonacci number with this formula as i understand it functions without recursion are vacuously recursive
student,for the list could we use reverse function for the rest like when i wrote rotate
student,the given isprime test case within filtertestcpp counts 1 as a prime number however 1 is not prime is this an isprime error or will the autograder accept 1 2 3 if it calls filter1 2 3 4 isprime
student,is it valid to write our own tail recursive function that returns the length of the list that was input how many numbers are in the list and then to use this function to help out our list processing functions for example in the rotatelist n function i might want to compare the input n to the length of the list list as well as use it in other functions to help create a base case for a tail recursive helper function i just want to make sure im not stepping out of bounds or doing something that is unnecessary from the beginning thanks
student,hello im not sure if im missing something obvious but i cant figure out the format to add an number to an existing tree using treemake do you have any recommendations
student,just out of curiosity i was just trying to write a function that sorts the elements in a list most of the sorting algorithms i know of rely on the fact that the index of the elements can be used as in the case of arraysvectors im just curious to know if anyone knows some algorithms that will work with the implementation of listt given and perhaps are even efficient
student,im coding in sublime and one of my functions for project 2 is incorrect so i installed a debugger sublimegdb before i can use the debugger though it requires me to configure it and i cant get the configuration right the example they give is workingdir folderprojectpath yourexecutablename note you must provide interpretermi for the plugin to work commandline gdb interpretermiyourexecutablename so here is what i entered for my configuration workingdir usersdanielpyatetskydropboxmy dropboxum schoolwork sophomoreeecs 280proj2p2 commandline gdb interpretermi p2 when i try to start the debugger it does not activate i think its something in my commandline but im not sure how can i fix thisis there a better alternative
student,im having a little trouble with the traversal function it makes a list in the order that its supposed to but every single element is doubled so if my tree was this 2 1 4 it would make a list 1 1 2 2 4 4 i understand why this happens because i append the list that has left top and top right which means top is doubled every node is doubled however i cant figure out how i would fix this because you cant make a list out of 3 parts in one function additionally i cant just simple choose to attach top to one side because then it wouldnt work recursively how can i fix this am i to make a helper function that makes a list out of 3 components
student,hi i having a problems figuring where to even start to this function
student,are we allowed to use a helper function with a recursive not tail recursive function
student,my partner and i just started this project and we are a little confused we understand that list is a pointer but doesnt that make it represent a function instead of an array with the numbers just by looking at the headers it looks like listt list is passed to most functions does this list represent the array or a function
student,probably a silly question but where do we see our grade for project 1
student,im creating a groupme for eecs 280 in order to just have easier contact with one another so if anyone is interested in forming a study group or still need partners please leave your name and number
student,the spec says that we are not allowed to use reference arguments if anyone out there is familiar with functional programming this effectively means that we cannot implement tailrecursion modulo cons correct the link has an example in c i have been able to complete the project without reference arguments but now i want to optimize since this project is very nearly a functional programming assignment ive been using my knowledge of fp to design efficient implementations and to avoid reconsing lists whenever possible sometimes this plays nicely with implementing methods tailrecursively but other times it doesnt in the latter cases i would like to solve the issue by tailrecursion modulo cons but theres no way to do this within the constraints of the spec right
student,so what im gathering from the project spec is that coveredby can be a sort of helper function for containedby and the only function we are required to write is containedby while writing covered by is a personal choice that might make our life a little bit easier
student,how can listt reverse return integer values if its listt return type even with a helper function listt reverse cant return the helper function of int type are we making a new list which holds the values in reverse of returning the actual integers
student,can we use while loops and for loops in lab 3
student,is submit280 up for project 2
student,for some reason none of my browsers will let me view the office hours via the schedules tab could someone post the office hours for today
student,my output is all slightly off after the first month 12 i believe im using the formula correctly from the specs but when i look at the sample output in the specs it seems to me that bbp and not bbp1r12 for example with a 100 payment rate of 05 and duration of 12 months for month 11 the balance is 19876 99599917 on the other hand if you follow the formula you get 9959991710512 197935 while this isnt my problem exactly i think it is stemming from the confusion with this thanks in advance
student,please enter the monthly payment 10 please enter the interest rate 00005 please enter the duration of the loan in years 1 month principal interest balance 12 1000 000 1000 11 1000 000 2000 10 1000 000 3000 9 1000 000 4000 8 1000 000 4999 7 1000 000 5999 6 1000 000 6999 5 1000 000 7999 4 1000 000 8998 3 1000 000 9998 2 1000 000 10997 1 1000 000 11997 the interest is clearly not zerosince the balance is not increasing by ten but the principal is showing ten all the time is it a problem i should worry about thanks
student,im compiling my code and i am getting this compiler error afsumicheduusersasathcoeecs280proj1p1cpp73 undefined reference to getparamstdbasicstringchar stdchartraitschar stdallocatorchar double double i get it for every line of code that calls getparam printheader or printmonthlydata as far as i can tell i am including ioh in my script with ioh and iocpp in my project 1 folder and i am calling those functions with the right variable types is there something else im missing or doing wrong
student,trying to include the ioh header library for the main code and gedit gives me and error saying project1cpp2416 error ioh no such file or directory the include line is written as includeioh
student,i logged into my redhat account on a caen computer and tried submitting project 1 however when i ran the submission script it told me that i was not in caen and had to use the ssh what am i doing wrong here
student,i wrote my project on xcode and am trying to figure out how to submit it i have logged on to ssh but dont know what to do next
student,hi i completed the project in xcode and i was hoping to upload the files onto my caen account using mfile i was able to download files from my caen account yesterday however today when i logged onto mfile i saw the message note you do not have read privileges for files in this directory i can no longer upload download or read files using mfile any idea whats going on thank you
student,calling the getparam function seems to work fine for me but im confused about the implementation in iocpp double getparamstring prompt double min double max double result min10 bool done false do cout prompt cin result if result min result max done true while done return result why is there a double result min10 at the beginning it seems to me as if the variable result takes on the value of user input why is it initialized to min10 thanks
student,hi a silly question what is the email address for 280help thanks a lot
student,project 2 has a due date of january 24th in the announcement and september 24th on the pdf what is the actual due date of project 2
student,so this may be a dumb question but i am confused about the getparam function i know that there are supposed to be 3 string prompts but dont we need to name them as prompt1 prompt2 prompt3 i think im just confused as to what our code needs to do and what the iocpp file already does for us
student,hey guys in the project 1 specs it states you may use only the c standard libraries and no others would cmath be considered a standard c library and therefore i can use it i just wanted to be sure thanks
student,can we assume that the user will enter a monthly payment that contains no more than two decimal places or do we need to account for that in our error checking
student,ive taken eecs 183 prior to this course and have many projects saved from that class im willing to bet that i am allowed to use my code from those projects to help complete projects in this class but will pulling any code that was implemented for me on those past projects and integrating them into these projects be considered a violation of the honor code
student,the lab 2 pdf says to copy this directory to your current directory with this command cp afsumicheduclasseecs280lablab10 shouldnt this really say lab02 and not lab10 i copied lab02 instead and that seems to be the correct one and given that this is lab 2 that would seem to make the most sense
student,i used the diff command and received this as my output i am a little confused on what my error is any hints or advice thank you
student,the instructions for submitting project 1 say that you have to use caen to submit your project files if i have been writing my code in gedit through vnc this means that im using caen already and should just follow the submission instructions through the terminal correct
student,when do we get our grades back for lab01cpp
student,after i submitted it said it was checking against the test case then it said it archived my submission then it said submission received i didnt get any feedback at all im also confused by the archive thing did i do it right thanks
student,im not sure how to do the calculation for the balance for the printmonthlydata function the new balance depends on the last months balance however last months balance is not a variable in the printmonthydata function thanks for your help d
student,is it possible for principle to go negative im in the process of debugging my project and if i type in a monthly balance of 10000 interest of 05 for 12 years i get this chart wondering if this is correct or far off from what i should be getting month principle interest balance 12 585062 4149 995851 11 171846 8282 1987569 10 239655 12397 2975173 9 649449 16494 3958678 8 1057543 20575 4938103 7 1463943 24639 5913463 6 1868657 28687 6884777 5 2271692 32717 7852060 4 2673054 36731 8815329 3 3072751 40728 9774602 2 3470789 44708 10729894 1 3867176 48672 11681222
student,this may have been already answered but do we need comments throughout our main function also is there a specific format for the header
student,im currently working on lab 2 which i know i should probably work on in discussion but thats beside the point as of right now ive nailed the hailstone test and am working on the digit counting the actual iterative part works fine i have yet to start on the recursive section but the output is strange and i dont know why instead of the equation outputting when it is called it produces the right output at the beginning of the line and gives a zero when called basically instead of looking like this iteration 3 it looks like 3iteration 0 theres spaces in the real function but theyve been removed here to illustrate the point i have no idea why this is happening and id like for someone to help me fix it
student,ive looked on ctools and its not there
student,since the spec sheet says to call getparam again if the user enters something other than an integer number of years ive been trying to use a while function combined with the static cast method described in an earlier question for example while double amount of years integer amount of years recall getparam function is this the correct way to approach this
student,i submitted my project a couple of times and i received you had zero compilation errors on the published test cases you had zero diff mismatches on the published test cases but when i diff check my result vs the output i get a difference i cannot find should i listen to the notice that was given to me from the autograder or quick diff
student,on the project description it says this each month the lender calculates the interest that must be paid by multiplying the outstanding balance on the loan by the interest rate the monthly payment is first used to pay off the interest the remainder is applied to the principal ie it is used to reduce the outstanding balance on the loan i figured out how the principle works but have yet to wrap my head around how to calculate the interest rate given an outstanding balance im starting at month 12 i tried multiplying 9959 005 using the example on the project description but it doesnt match the 041 interest rate that i am looking for how do i get that first interest rate starting from the top
student,is there lab this week i couldnt find anything about it on ctools
student,ive got the code functioning with all the pieces except for the fact that im very slightly off the example i noticed that the interest amount is always rounded down this means principal and balance have to be rounded up i have this is my code and on the example with 100 monthly payment 5 interest and 1 year period i have a final balance of 116806 which is 6 cents off the final balance of 116812 the first deviation is in month 7 here is my output as of right now month principal interest balance 12 9958 041 9958 11 9917 083 19876 10 9876 124 29752 9 9835 165 39587 8 9794 206 49381 7 9753 247 59134 6 9712 288 68846 5 9672 328 78518 4 9632 368 88150 3 9592 408 97742 2 9552 448 107294 1 9512 488 116806
student,can we use andor will we be using code conforming to the c11 standard in this course doing so would require an additional flag to the compiler which would go against the instruction in the spec telling us how to compile
student,are we required to attend lab if we complete lab assignments on our own do lab sessions cover any extra material aside from what is needed to complete the lab assignment
student,so when i first compiled my code i only had include ioh this resulted in undefined getparam error message so i added include iocpp which solved the issue but i thought im not suppose to include any cpp in my code can someone explain it to me what happened there did i compile wrong
student,is it necessary to align the output as shown in the sample case in the spec if so what are ways of aligning the output if a the month is 1 2 or 3 digits then the output gets misaligned so what are ways of getting around that ive experimented with setw as well as making if then statements in order to output different number of spaces depending on the number lets say month and i assume this should be done in the printmonthlydata function
student,im having trouble accessing the files through caens im just unfamiliar with the code needed to get into the directory and working on the project through caens even after completing lab 01 ive been working on it on xcode so far with time ill get a hang of it but is it possible for someone to post the steps needed to work on the project in the caens environment
student,quick question on the recursive function were trying to make for digit counting so i set up the program to cut off when n10 zero and to check for when n10 digit and i know that each recursive call should be functionn10 so as to eliminate digit by digit but how can we store information about each successful digit match if we include a variable like count initializing that to zero at the beginning would wipe it out with each recursive call any insight
student,i was going through the test output and verifying it against what i had gotten and everything came out to be correct however if i do the calculations by hand they all come out correct according to my calculator except month 4 which should have been 88154 rounded from 8815369295 this may be an issue with the equation that i am using but my output for the program matched the test output just my calculator had a mismatch with both the test and actual output also in other tests that i have run myself month 4 seems to be the only mismatch i have between my calculator and the output on the screen anyone know what might be going on
student,hi i know that a similar question was asked but i just want some clarification the intructions say to use caen to submit your project files you must ssh to loginenginumichedu and perform all final testing and submissions from there im already logged into redhat through vnc could i just submit the project using the linux terminal or do i have to ssh from the linux terminal to loginumichedu then submit
student,saying that there could be a possible loss of information from the conversion of double to int for my months variable however when i compile using gcc everything goes fine and i dont seem to be getting any errors both environments produce the expected output
student,i submitted and got no errors using the eecs280 submit script but im still kinda worried that i may mess up on some cases that i havent tried
student,i just did a diff check and i got this i dont know what it means bash41 diff output1 testout 16d15 bash41
student,hi all i have this weird output by the g compiler while it works fine in my own environmentcould someone have a look at it thanks
student,do i need to consider counting 0s
student,my code has a weird issue when prompted to ask for a monthly payment it only allows me to input a value of 0 if i put in anything besides 0 it will just continue to ask me to put in the monthly payment any ideas where this could be coming from thanks
student,i am having a small issue compiling i thought i was in the clear but when i went to compile in the cain enviorment i recieve the message printed below i did most of my work in visual studios and there it appeard to compile and be tested with no problems i moved all the files into a folder accesable from the cain enviorment and they are all up to date line 47 which i beleve it to be referring too is a for loop counting down the months and used for doing calculations any help would be greatly appreciated thank you what i type and what i recieve bash41 g pedantic wall werror o1 p1cpp iocpp o p1 cc1plus warnings being treated as errors p1cpp in function ‘int main’ p1cpp47 error statement has no effect
student,how do we submit to the autograder is their a maximum amount of submissions per day with feedback
student,my code works for the given test case but how would i go about testing it further im kinda worried that i screwed up on something thats not showing up in the test case any ideas working everything out by hand seems a little tedious
student,hi im able to compile my code and it works fine when i vnc into caen but when i try to submit p1cpp i get warning submission does not pass published test cases and i read earlier that it is caused by not being able to compile what exactly would be wrong
student,my project one complies and runs fine but when i go to submit it says i am not submitting from a caen environment if i include the if i dont it says no such job i am logged into linux on a computer in the dude right now i cannot use vnc because my caen account isnt fully active evidently it was deleted and i didnt notice until now thanks
student,i was just wondering what kinds of doubles classify as an integer when integers are stored as doubles weird things happen such as how you can assign 5 to a double and it will really be stored as something like 49999997 is there a specific epsilon we should use when comparing a double and a rounded version of the double
student,ive been looking through the test examples and im worried what can i do about memory leaks the specdocumentation clearly indicates that some functions must create a new list what about the old one how ought i delete it should the example program be expected to do this should i use new or malloc since the abstraction is cstyle code should i just not care and let the program leak its brains out im sorry if this sounds so confused and is an obvious question but my experience does not come from um so i dont know what the logistics is when it comes to handling this kind of problem
student,if we add some helper functions with leading static in p2cpp does it compile while the header file does not contain those helper functions in p2h
student,i was working on lab assignment 2 and when i compiled and ran the program it printed out the necessary information yet when i began to work on the countdigitsrecursive function the program no longer printed out the remainder of the information it stopped here countdigits test how many 2s in 201220130 iterative 3 is this supposed to happen very confused because my program was working fine and printing out everything normally before
student,hi i joined this class today and while i was able to take care of the 1st project i did miss the possibility of submitting the first lab will that still count negatively towards my grade if so is it possible for me to make this up somehow
student,out of curiosity if we define a function macro do we add an rme just as we do for normal functions and if so in what ways does the format vary if any
student,i am trying to compile my code using g wall werror pedantic p2cpp recursivecpp o p2 and i keep getting this error message usrlibgccx8664redhatlinux447lib64crt1o in function start text0x20 undefined reference to main collect2 ld returned 1 exit status any ideas why my code is not compiling
student,are rme comments required for helper functions as well
student,looking for a partner to work with on the projects i live in nq
student,anybody in need a partner living northwest of campus
student,the project specification states that a list is in no particular order but then some of the functions rely on the list having an ordering such as reverse or chop what does it mean to carry out such a function on a list in no particular order
student,the only compilation errors i have are when i use the iocpp functions in p1cpp i included ioh every time i call the functions from iocpp i get an error is anyone else getting this compilation error
student,i am finding it a little hard to understand the output of treeprint as the project specification mentions the output is not very intuitive could someone please explain how to decipher it into a more traditional binary tree
student,hey guys looking for a partner to work with on the upcoming projects i took 183 last semester with as on every project and looking to do the same this semester im very serious about this class as i intend to minor in computer science im ideally looking for somebody who took engin 101 in order to diversify our skill sets but am open to any serious partner especially someone who lives on central campus let me know if youre interested mreckerumichedu
student,so i was having difficulty in cases where n0 and the digit0 or where n a number and digit0 i check for n 0 in order to end the count but if n 0 then it wont count it however i fixed this by checking first to see if n digit and return 1 unfortunately this causes it to count an extra zero in nonzero numbers any help would be great
student,hi is the professor prakash lecture that was originally 4306 in dow still moved to 5630 in chrysler thanks
student,i figured out how to count digits recursively im working on the tail recursion function right now am i allowed to add a third parameter to the countdigitstail function thanks
student,i live on the second floor in alice lloyd
student,why there is no record for lecture 001 i dont understand
student,on pages 7 and 8 of the project 2 spec covered by requires that both trees have the same topmost element while this does not seem to be a requirement for contained by when the spec states in other words it makes it seem as if covered by and contained by are related are we encouraged to write a containedby function in the same way that we are encouraged to write a coveredby function
student,under p2h in the rme for filtereven function it says for example if you applied filerodd to the list 4 1 3 0 you would get the list 4 0 it means filtereven right
student,im not quite understanding the difference between fib and fibtail when i wrote fibint n i wrote it as tailrecursive am i supposed to write a regular recursion for fibint n and tail recursion for fibtail or can i have the same code for both functions
student,hello so far i only made the list sum and product functions along with corresponding helper functions int sumlistt list int productlistt list i wanted to test my functions so i compiled here is the error i got all i did was edit the sum and product functions in p2cpp bash41 g o2 pedantic wall werror o simpletest simpletestcpp p2cpp recursivecpp tmpccfg8jjco in function main simpletestcpptext0xf9 undefined reference to reversevoid simpletestcpptext0x14a undefined reference to appendvoid void collect2 ld returned 1 exit status bash41 thanks
student,just making sure but are we allowed to use while loops with recursion
student,to write a tail recursive fib function i create a fibhelper function which take 3 inputs is this function still tailrecursive if in fibhelper function i use return as follow return fibhelperabc a b c stands for modifications of three inputs
student,to implement the fibtail function i have created a helper function which runs tail recursively while the original fibtail function does not however i have conditions in the fibtail function to check whether or not i should run the helper function if depending on the inputs there are cases where i do not run the helper function is my overall implementation still considered tail recursive or even recursive
student,i created a helper function for the countdigitstail function but when i try to compile the program it says that countdigitstailhelper was not declared in this scope i am not exactly sure how to fix this
student,just curious why do we need to do static for tail recursive helper function in project 2
student,so for project 2 the header file p2h has an include recursiveh statement up top do i need to include it again in my p2cpp file or would that be redundant
student,5 4 is contained by or not the description in project2pdf is not consistent 2 5 3 and i find you need not explicitly write coveredby but we recommend it as it is likely to make your solution simpler overall to separate it really confusing can anyone give me more explanations thanks you need not explicitly write coveredby but we recommend it as it is likely to make your solution simpler overall to separate it
student,i feel like this is a silly question but how do we make a tree for testing the treemake function makes an empty tree and the treemakeint treet treet function makes a tree requiring two subtrees how do we make the subtrees
student,i am trying to compile my lab02 code but when i try to do so it outputs bash41 g ­wall ­werror ­o1 ­pedantic lab02cpp ­o lab02 g ­wall no such file or directory g ­werror no such file or directory g ­o1 no such file or directory g ­pedantic no such file or directory g ­o no such file or directory g lab02 no such file or directory lab02cpp in function ‘void hailstoneiterativeint’ lab02cpp23 error a functiondefinition is not allowed here before ‘’ token lab02cpp32 error a functiondefinition is not allowed here before ‘’ token lab02cpp41 error a functiondefinition is not allowed here before ‘’ token lab02cpp50 error a functiondefinition is not allowed here before ‘’ token lab02cpp56 error a functiondefinition is not allowed here before ‘’ token lab02cpp62 error a functiondefinition is not allowed here before ‘’ token lab02cpp70 error a functiondefinition is not allowed here before ‘’ token lab02cpp85 error expected ‘’ at end of input what is the issue
student,will we ever need to use a guionly program from the caen environment to complete any assignments for this class
student,what are some common techniques that partners are using to collaborate their code in order to make sure that their work does not overlap each others etc
student,i know that each function requires a positive number but if the test case inputs a negative number what are we suppose to do because it enters an infinite loop do we reprompt for another input
student,is it possible to let us know what are those errors that you guys let slip i am just curious and want to learn more thanks
student,for traversaltreet tree im a little worried about the exact order if given a complex tree if we are given a tree 5 3 7 2 2 6 5 1 4 1 3 is the outputted list 1 2 4 3 1 2 3 5 6 7 5
student,as we only write functions in project2 and specifications of these functions is included in the head file do we still need to comment on these functions i found it really difficult describing the logic behind the code
student,would this be considered recursive void functionint n if n 1 return else if return function else return function
student,hey im trying to test my reverse function for project 2 my code compiles fine but this shows up bash41 simpletest 1 2 3 4 5 11 12 13 14 15 0x14dc230 0x14dc2f0 i guess it didnt reverse the two test lists should i bring this problem to office hours or does anyone have any insight why this happens thanks
student,ive been having a lot of trouble trying to write a recursive function that works for all of the cases given the problem usually ends up with my code being unable to count a 0 given just n 0 however in all my attempts to fix that error i always end up with 4 0s in the case n 201220130 and digit 0 due to the fact that n10 0 i just cant seem to get it same with my tail recursive function any hints
student,when i do a recursive hailstone my sequence starts backwards for n 5 i get 1 2 4 8 16 5 and for n 8 1 2 4 8 what am i missing here thanks
student,what does it mean for a function to be associative
student,can we create an additional function such as listsize that is not directly a tail recursive helper function but aids in completing the required functions
student,almost done project2 want partner for the rest projects live in nw2 lsa student my email is helangumichedu
student,is a tree like this possible 4 3 4 4 3 5
student,would this still be considered a base case for a recursion if n a n b n c return 0
student,when i compile my code the cout statements written in int main dont run how do i fix this thanks
student,it seems that my p1 failed the long duration test but i believe i have done it right and tested it before i submitted it does anyone have any idea what long duration test might be and if theres something wrong about grading how do i submit a regrade request thanks
student,after reading the description a few times i still dont understand what this function is supposed to do could i get another example or explanation
student,a bit stuck on the recursive digit counting functions i understand how to find and count the digits themselves and i already did it iteratively but how do i keep the total count when doing it recursively when im calling return 1 countdigitsrecursiven digit obviously a static variable does not work can someone give me a hint please
student,hi i am trying to finish my lab 2 and for some reason the program does not run through all the way it stops after how many 2s in 201220130 and rather than stop running it just stops unless i control c for it to stop what is happening
student,does the rotate have to function for a value of n that is greater than the length of the list
student,i have a few of questions about the accumulate and filter functions in project 2 is my understanding of accumulate correct accumulate will for a nonempty set perform the operation of fn on all elements on the list for example if accumulate 1 2 3 add 0 will result in 6 overall why does the project spec say add as opposed to sum as the function is previously defined this is because of the syntax of the function being int accumulate listt list int fnint int int identity this part of the code int fnint int basically says that the function we will be inputting which is either sum or product will take two ints as input and output an int so using that logic why is the filter function defined as listt filterlistt list bool fnint if the two filter functions have the form listt filteroddlistt list shouldnt the function handle and the original function match thank you
student,i mightve done something a little weird but does it appear to anyone else that the treeleft treeright functions are switched ie the treeleft function returns the right subtree and vice versa
student,the lab only needs to pass the given tests right
student,for a lot of the functions we need to make for project2 they require that n of elements in list in our functions do we have to check for valid input thanks
student,if i wanted to see if my project 2 code simply compiled what terminal command would i use
student,int counthelper int count return counthelper count 2 even though there is computation when the recursion starts is this considered tail recursion or just recursion
student,can we submit our own test cases along with the ones provided for lab 2
student,is their an instructor or gsi that i can send or show part of my code to online for help
student,could i write other functions for example if i want to create and use a function that finds the size of the list could i
student,is it okay for students to share code for test cases i dont think it should be a problem as this is not submitted for work but i still want to check first
student,ive completed one function that does not itself use recursion or any forbidden things like while for etc but only calls upon other tail recursive functions these other functions are from the other required functions but not technically helper functions is this acceptable
student,im confused on how to express an anonymous function as an input for the accumulate function for example the spec lists the anonymous function input as int fnint int is that how we should express it or is that just the variable type for example int accumulatehelperlistt list int fnint int int identity int result if … else return accumulatehelperlist fnint int………
student,if we are using helper functions can our original functions use ifelse statements to call different versions of our helper function helper functions with different inputs for example this is just a mock example int function int x int y if x 0 functionhelper x 1 y1 call helper function else functionhelperx1 0 call helper function
student,so when i try to call the accumulate function in my test code like below i got this compiling saying add was not declared and expected primary expression expected before int and also this looks weird even to myself cout accumulatelista addint int 0 could some one tell me how i should call this function in the testing code thanks
student,are we allowed to use functions from project to write other functions for example using listappend function to define a different function that we need to write for the project
student,i have a line of code like this in insertlist return result append append a b c ive wrote append as tail recursive function and my question is that does this line make my insertlist function nontailrecursive thanks a lot
student,not sure what happened when they were being written up but all the test files seem to be missing the line include recursiveh when the spec said that they should include that line just a heads up so you can fix it when you get the files or so the source files can be fixed
student,during eecs 183 we worked with arrays and they could either be defined as an int double or a string is it the same idea with lists i assume you have to define a list variable in order to check if it is empty or not
student,hello in the accumulate function our accumulate function is written such that it depends on another fn eg add product even if we have written the accumulate function such that it is tail recursive just do exactly what the effects prompt tells us to do is it still tail recursive when the fn such as add is not tail recursive in other words i can see that my accumulate stack frame can be continuously reused but it calls an x amount of add stack frames where x is the number of elements in the list
student,im confused about the behavior of the inserttree function for certain numbers for example if i have the tree from the example 4 2 5 1 3 and i tried to insert 2 into this tree using inserttree what would my output be thanks
student,do we need to write the code for listisempty listmake etc that are included in that part when i tried to test using xcode it says that they are not written and they arent theyre only defined from what i can tell do i need to get them from somewhere or am i not supposed to be using them
student,just to clarify all the list function should be tailrecursive
student,hi just a quick question can the list contain negative integers thanks
student,so for functions like listt filterodd should we have to error check for example in the specs for int product if the list is empty it should return 1 if the list is empty for listt filterodd should we have to write a code that returns something else or not because it isnt written in the specs
student,i dont understand this part how does this work i can print starting with the first month the format is odd because im using xcode
student,what is the best way to check the input parameter years is an integer also we dont have to deal with the cases where input is not a number right because i tried using getparam function to get a nonnumerical input like aa bb then the getparam function turned into an infinite loop but we cant modify it
student,how do i use the submenus file edit options buffers tools c help when im in the emacs editor on a mac terminal some websites on google say to just click it but i cant its just highlightable text for me and clicking it doesnt do anything is there a special keyboard shortcut to access these sub menus
student,ive tried an extreme case where the entry for years had a gap of zeros between the ones place and 1024th place the entry was interpreted as an integer is this number beyond what a double floating point can handle and therefore a case not to worry about or is there something i can do thanks
student,has professor ringenbergs lecture changed to angel hall because thats what it says on wolverine access but i havent gotten an email about it
student,my output is all correct except for the first row where i have 9958 42 and 9958 how is this possiblewhat could i possibly be doing wrong thank you
student,in the lecture 2 slides why is include ioh placed in both iocpp and p1cpp
student,forgive me if this has been asked before but could someone explain to me how to get this big decimal down to two decimal places the program i have keeps rounding it up to 042 ultimately resulting in an incorrect match thank you
student,so with getparam you input a string a min and a max and you get a result that is returned i want to know what this is called so i can assign it to variables for later use if i can understand this i should be fine for the rest of the project
student,hello i remember in the first class a professor or gsi said there was a specific number of hours you should take to complete project one if you take longer than this time then you should consider reviewing the material more or something around those lines can someone remind me what the expected number of hours to work on the project is thank you
student,as a student coming from eecs 183 i used xcode but as i can see from the many posts before this there is some other way we are supposed to do the project and people are using terminology that i dont understand as a relatively new eecs student such as ssh caen and so on im extremely confused as to what i have to do so i was wondering if i could just start my project in xcode and then learn about the caen accounts and all in discussion on wednesday and then copy paste my code into this caen program thing sorry im so vague but im just confused hopefully once this project is over i will have an idea of all of this so this wont be a problem for project 2
student,ive successfully connected to a caen account through the vnc client however when i click out of the vnc window ie back to my desktop on my own computer it no longer takes character keyboard inputs but will still accept mouse input and things like space this makes it impossible to edit my code if ive clicked out any advice
student,as an data mining informatics major i took 182 and 282 last year and decided i wanted to take a couple more cs courses however i have a life science informatics friend who said he was told by his advisor that if he took 280 after 282 he would only get 2 credits for 280 is this true on wolverine access it says i am registered for 4 credits i am also contacting my department advisor but wanted to ask the instructors directly just in case basically my reason for taking 280 is that i want to at least take up to 281 i am under the impression that because the jumps from 183 to 280 to 281 are so big that if i want to eventually take 281 my next step after 282 is 280 and then 281 thanks in advance for any input
student,how do we submit our project through the submit280 script also how does the script differ from the autograder in eecs 183 does it give us any feedback
student,whats the policy on using code bitslibraries on a project that we might not have learned in 183101 or in class yet specifically im using a trycatch block for error checking in this project
student,when i run the following lines in my working directory nothing happens is there something im missing p1 test1 testout diff testout output1
student,hi everyone im a senior double majoring in math and econ still looking for someone to collaborate on projects 26 i finished eecs 183 in fall 2012 with a raw score above 100 looking for someone who takes this hardcore class seriously it would be logistically ideal if you live on central campus too contact meshenumichedu
student,when i run my code i get the correct output in the file but i dont think my code ever stops running in the linux terminal i never get a new bash line and i have to hit ctrl c im new to this stuff so i apologize if im just confused or not making sense
student,so we take in the monthly payment p the interest rate r and the length of the loan in years how do we use this information to find out how much of a car one can afford in other words the first months outstanding balance is there a huge thing im missing in the spec
student,i noticed that there are reading assignments in chapters that dont seem to exist in the online version of the textbook provided it seems that the online version only has chapter 1 5 just wanted to check if there is another link to the full version of the textbook online or if i am missing something in navigating the page thanks
student,im confused on how to use the submit280 script should it run on vim or just on the terminal thanks to everyone who replies
student,im still trying to figure out how to compile p1cpp in linux i wrote the following command line g pedantic wall werror –o1 p1cpp iocpp o p1 in the linux terminal but nothing returned i tried opening the p1 file in my proj1 folder but it cannot open any advice on how i can compile p1cpp for testing i
student,for some unknown reason all the caen computers in bursley dont feel like logging into linux right now so im using windows i can run this just fine in linux but i dont know how to get to the folder in the command prompt much less run the thing in windows help
student,currently my program does all the calculations treating all the numbers as doubles this runs fine and i end up with a zero balance my question is how are we to handle values that are fractions of a penny eg 000034 of my payment goes towards paying off the principal these values end up being cut off by the precision in the output so these small reductions in the balance arent reflected in the output but occur none the less should i be treating all these values as doubles or should i use the same precision as the output for my calculations i figure this would greatly affect results in some test cases
student,im writing my code in windows visual studio even though i put include ioh at the top of my program as exactly specified in the project spec despite this the debugger says that all of my function calls from ioh in main are undefined does anyone know what is going wrong i think it has to do with the way im using visual studio my friends who are using linux tell me that the ioh functions work just fine
student,i was working on the lab 1 on my mac and when i tried the gdb command to debug the code the terminal said gdb command not found i am using mac mavericks os x 109 i did some research online and there was one post referring me to install the command line tools developed by apple on xcode the installation was successful but when i tried to type in gdb command in the terminal again it still showed command not found anyone knows why and how should i solve this issue thanks in advance
student,if nothing is returned when i use this command on two files in terminal does it mean there are no differences
student,looking to start a group of 2 5 people once project 2 starts to work together on projects and study im a sophomore who lives in alice lloyd so if there is anyone interested who lives in the hill area or even central campus please contact me my number is 8108757641
student,hello the description of lab 1 says that the due date of lab 1 is due on september 13 by 1155 pm which would be tonight however i was under the impression that labs are to be done in the discussion section also the due date under the actual assignment tab is september 17 by 1155 pm which due date is the correct due date thanks in advance
student,ive finished lab01 and looked at the labs doc on the google drive but i cant figure out how to submit it any hints thanks
student,in the case where my monthly payment is 10000 and i have a rate that ends up giving me a payment towards interest of 1005 and a payment towards principal of 98995 is it okay that that my output values of two decimal place precision 101 9900 add up to a number that is larger than what i stated my monthly payment should be
student,when i try to test my code using the following line p1 test1 testout terminal on mac spits back p1 no such file or directory i took eecs 183 so this is my first time using linux and terminal to edit so it could be something simple im doing i followed all of the directions on the handout to create the project and wrote it in emacs from the terminal thanks
student,i try to use vmware to connect the loginenginumichedu but it counld not happen my gsi also face the same problem on surface pro any one could figure it out
student,when i execute my program after compiling it shows me two different tablesneither of them are headed by month principal interest or balance and none of my prompts are showing up i know its probably hard to identify this sort of problem but any help would be appreciated
student,i made the changes to the program added the sign in the if statement but for some reason when i run the program in the terminal the wrong message still up its a small world after all i am not sure what is wrong
student,before we submit lab1 do we need a header or is just our name and uniquename adequate for submitting
student,hi all i am new to linux but seem to be getting along well since im old enough to have used dos i am however wondering what the best way to write additional test cases happens to be since unlike eecs 183 there is no feedback provided for the submissions ive entirely completed the project including error checking for the int upon years input and there are no differences between my output and the output1 file im happy to write additional tests and write expected outputs using web based amortization tables and am curious if others are doing something similar thanks for any feedback you can provide
student,i know this is a silly question but i cant find open a terminal under application system tools i opened cean account yesterday so i can only use the terminal in duder second floor could anyone kindly tell me thank you
student,is it possible to write in the schedule to say where the office hours are today at each time thank you
student,does every tail recursive function have an invariant why or why not
student,may i ask why i got no such file or directory even if i already have mkdir eecs280 and the file exists
student,i wasnt too sure about what exactly principal was but is it just 100 our monthly interest rate
student,im planning to majorminor in cs and trying to learn as much as possible to allow myself to do my own personal projects later looking for a partner with similar ambitions im taking both 280 and 203 pretty seriously so i can get a solid cs foundation and im willing to work together for both classes just want a partner whos dedicated and not necessarily doing the projects simply to get them done let me know mjshenumichedu
student,are professor ringenbergs and professor prakashs office hours still taking place on monday even though it is mlk day
student,when i attempt to compile my code on caens this prints out lab01 no such file or directory g unrecognized option ­o however i know lab01cpp is in the directory because it says so when i type ls anyone know what the possible issue can be i added the hello world line in the file using xcode and saved my discussion was this morning when caens was down so i didnt get a chance to ask my gsi this
student,i am unsure how to create the p1cpp file in ssh can anyone clarify how to do this
student,hi i have never used caen before and i am trying to connect remotely through my laptop but i cannot figure out how this link httpcaenenginumicheduconnectoverview seems to be what im looking for but that just directs me to here httpcaenenginumicheduconnectssh which isnt telling me what i need to know what am i missing thanks
student,i think i broke my program is this bad if so how can i fix it thanks
student,hi i just submitted but i dont know whether i passed when and where could i check
student,i used a while condition to check if the double variable minus the int variable was greater than 0 to check if the user has entered a non integer value this works perfectly fine for smaller decimals such as 099 but when i input a larger decimal such as 09999999999999999999999999999 the program just rounds to 1 and accepts it as a good input is this acceptable to submit or will this be considered a bug and will i have to figure out another way to do it
student,i saw the other post regarding pass by reference but i am still confused i understand the calculations but when i attempt to write code to print out the table all my values are the same and the only solution that comes to my head is that these values need to be pass by reference is that correct since these values build upon each other how do i get them to change in respect to each other
student,how could i know if my lab submission is pass or fail thanks for any information
student,im looking for a partner for projects 25 if anyone else is still looking im studying cs so this class is very important and my main priority this term contact me at mduskumichedu if youre interested
student,mkdir is the command to making a directory whats the command for deleting one and how would i implement it is the same as for making on for example mkdir
student,so i want to test my p1 code through linux i copied several files through ssh but now i cannot copy anymore cuz it said disk quota exceeded when copy files also when i tried to test it in some different folder i cannot really use this two lines of code p1 test1 testout diff testout output1 the ssh just dont do anything anymore after i type in these two lines
student,ok im pretty much finished with my project and everything runs fine in the compiler i just had a few questions on style should the variables used be descriptive such as double monthlyinterest or double nextbalance should we add comments to a while loop to describe what it is doing or to any declarations
student,how do you use the printmonthlydata function correct me if im wrong but doesnt the function require you to put in values that vary depending on the monthly payment the interest rate and the duration it makes sense to me if the variables were pass by reference but theyre pass by value which seems confusing because those numbers depend on the inputted values
student,i can run the p1 file properly with the command p1 tee p1out with proper input but when i try to use p1 test1 testout it just does not stop running and finally create a really big file i have no idea why everything works well when i try to run the code and do manually input
student,just to clarify since we do not have to write getparam im assuming that the functions included in p1cpp are main printheader and printmonthydata is that correct im also assuming that the declaration definition and implimentation of those functions should be in p1cpp sorry if these questions sound trivial i havent programmed in a while
student,when can we submit project 1
student,if we initially submit a project then later find we want to change something are we allowed to resubmit the new version using submit280 again or is there only 1 submission per project
student,should there be a return at the end of our code
student,i understand that the auto grader only gives us feedback with regard to the published test case but do we find out what score we got on each submission or do we have to wait til after the due date to find out what score we got on the project i am fairly confident in my code but knowing the score of each submission would help me know if my code received 100 or there is something more i need to go back to look at
student,my xcode is not identifying string as a keyword and i can thus not really do anything any thoughts ive played around with different libraries but even the code copied directly from the spec isnt recognizing string as a special special thing
student,i want to use a function to determine if a number is an integer for one part of the code so i included the line at the top of my code include mathh which allows me to do what i need is this allowed
student,i know they require you to put an rme documentation for any functions you write on your own but if i dont have any helper functions in my program should i include an rme above the main function or sohuld i at least include a brief description of what the program does thank you
student,is the following function tail recursive void function if function else function
student,for calculating the amount of interest paid per month do you divide the rate by 12 and multiply by the outstanding balance or do you divide the rate by the number of months in the loan and multiply by the outstanding balance
student,since the formula for interest payment is 1 rate12 i was confused about whether or not that changes depending on how many years it is basically does the equation need to include 1 rate12 or 1 rate12 number of years
student,so i had my code finished it compiled and worked great i come back to it and recompile just to make sure everything is set before i submit and now im getting these weird errors tmpccdvmwpho in function main p1cpptext0x54 undefined reference to getparamstdbasicstringchar stdchartraitschar stdallocatorchar double double p1cpptext0xf0 undefined reference to getparamstdbasicstringchar stdchartraitschar stdallocatorchar double double p1cpptext0x188 undefined reference to getparamstdbasicstringchar stdchartraitschar stdallocatorchar double double p1cpptext0x231 undefined reference to getparamstdbasicstringchar stdchartraitschar stdallocatorchar double double p1cpptext0x2a7 undefined reference to printheader p1cpptext0x3ac undefined reference to printmonthlydataint double double double collect2 ld returned 1 exit status anyone get these also have an any idea what they mean my only guess is that the compiler isnt correctly looking up my ioh directory but i havent changed anything so i dont know why that would suddenly be true
student,a real quickie what output can we expect from submit280 upon a successful run of the published test cases or does it return nothing
student,what editors do you recommend in engr101 we were forced to use gedit its simple and it works but i heard that vim is very useful and should be learned by others currently im running a virtual machine on my computer with debian and have an environment thats just like remotely logging in to caen vnc works well and i dont need an internet connection to code but theres internet everywhere here anyway so what editors would you suggest what are you currently using
student,hi when i try to compile my p1cpp file i get an error that suggests that i cant access the ioh and iocpp files but include ioh is at the top of my p1cpp file does anyone know why i cant access the io functions this is the error message that terminal gives me bash41 g p1cpp o p1 tmpccv1ogyto in function main p1cpptext0xc undefined reference to printheader p1cpptext0x4d undefined reference to getparamstdbasicstringchar stdchartraitschar stdallocatorchar double double p1cpptext0xdd undefined reference to getparamstdbasicstringchar stdchartraitschar stdallocatorchar double double p1cpptext0x175 undefined reference to getparamstdbasicstringchar stdchartraitschar stdallocatorchar double double p1cpptext0x27e undefined reference to printmonthlydataint double double double collect2 ld returned 1 exit status
student,if the user enters a double for loan duration do we round up for the number of months for the loan for example if years 14 number of months is 168 therefore should the length of the loan be 16 months or 17 months if years 12 number of months is 144 therefore is the length of of the loan 14 months or 15 months
student,sine we are only turning in p1cpp no header file should we include rmes for any additional functions we write
student,how do i copy files in linux i know you use the cp command but not entirely sure how to i am trying to copy the given files into my workspace
student,in the following code is the stack frame for function f destroyed once the first call to the helper function is made int fint a return helpera 1
student,im looking to submit my code for project 1 ive creatededited the file in my directory on one of the umich computers using gedit i understand that i need to be in the caen environment to submit the code but i figured that being loggedin using my caen account on a university computer would be satisfactory however the submission script reports an error stating that i do not appear to be submitting from caen can anyone let me know what im doing wrong here and what i need to do in order to submit it properly thanks in advance for your help
student,im a bit confused as to what the initial value for outstanding balance is since we do not input this from the user
student,i submitted project 1 and did not get any feedback other than that i indeed submitted the project and had zero differences with the public test cases and no compile errors is there not grade feedback
student,in the style guidelines it doesnt give a format for where we should include a name instructor section or anything like that is this information necessary to include and if so where should we put it
student,ive tried to come up with a variety of test cases to test my code for project 1 ive particularly tried to come up with test cases that are on the boundaries of the acceptable ranges for the inputs so far i havent found any bugs which actually makes me kind of nervous do you have any advice on how to come up with other good test cases
student,i was just confused as to where we need to include the rmes for this project to get full credit since we are only submitting p1cpp since they are provided in the ioh file that was given to us we do not need to include the function declarations and their respective rmes in the p1cpp file correct any guidance would be much appreciated
student,i am trying to figure out how to get my columns to match up with the outputs that are given as an example by using the equations that were given to us to calculate interest which of the columns should we start with first should we start with the interest first or the principal or the balance each one needs each other to get the end result so i believe that is why i keep getting errors with my final output
student,
student,while reading online about how to generally convert recursive functions to tail recursive forms i cam across many questions regarding how to convert recursive functions with more than one recursive call in ther definitions the answers to these questions often involved using this concept of continuation passing style used in functional programming languages such as scheme can someone please explain what it exactly is in simple terms thank you
student,eg if the user enters 4 for duration should we print the table starting from month 412 48 not sure if month 1188 make sense if the user puts a 99year inquiry
student,i was trying to access my caen account remotely using the vmware client however i constantly get the error message the view connection server connection failed verify that the view connection server address and network settings are correct any suggestions
student,are the instructions to submit project 1 up on ctools yet if not when will they be posted thanks
student,looking at the example table in the pdf it is obvious that the values for the interest rates are rounded down to two decimal places on the table eg 100 05 12 4166667 not 41 as shown in the table is this done by printmonthlydata or should we be doing this ourselves
student,when i compile the program i get an error that says too few arguments to function printmonthlydataint double double double i thought it was just supposed to be printmonthlydata but thats wrong with four arguments how would i call this function in c
student,while trying to compile p1cpp the compiler gives the following error in file included from p1cpp5 ioh5 error expected ‘’ before ‘using’ i have not modified the file i even recopied it to make sure i have the original file is anyone else getting this and does anybody know how to fix it the ioh file looks fine to me and im not sure why or where you would put the semicolon before using
student,my balance column has a few rounding errors most of the rows are correct but some are off by a penny specifically months 5 7 and 12 what could be the cause of that my second question is how is the interest column calculated its not just summing rate12100 for each monthim a bit confused by it thanks
student,so im trying to test the given functions in my cpp file i simply have one function running which is my printheader function i have included the header file i have tried writing it as printheader printheader and printheadervoid it doesnt seem to run any way i can fix this
student,are discussion sections meeting tomorrow or for the rest of this first week of class
student,how do we access the files in the directory afsumicheduclasseecs280proj1
student,do we have the option to partner with a student from a different lecture section
student,i was going to take this class last semester and i bought the book that was used last semester can i use absolute c the book that used last semester or do i need to buy the new book
student,the syllabus says to refer to the calendar on the course website i cant seem to find it please help me out thanks calendar on the course website
student,the gui freezes when i try to access the folder at afsumicheduclasseecs280proj1
student,the project spec says you may use only the c standard libraries and no others ive been looking on the internet but i want to be completely clear on what is and what isnt considered a part of the c standard libraries
student,just a quick question about starting up using linux prior to discussion as i dont really understand what it is yet i read in a linux tutorial that a linux terminal is preinstalled on all macs if that is the case what is the purpose of installing a vnc client which i have done and have been able to access the terminal thanks
student,im trying to figure out how to write test cases for my code as ive already passed the sample case is the only way to do this to work out a few more cases by hand im not sure how that would be any different from just running my code as im sure to use the same algorithms by hand as i did in my code
student,if we are given five years as the duration does the list become 1 60 or 1 12 five times over
student,will someone post them since im not ctools yet thanks
student,this is my output in project 1 but why cant my numbers be lined up with the rightmost dash as project1pdf shows i was guessing this might be something about the printmonthlydata function in iocpp but we are not allowed to modify that doc so could anyone shed light on this thx
student,when i try to calculate the loan amount i need to raise a power in my equation i am wondering am i allowed to include mathh in my p1cpp file
student,i am confused about the definition of integer number of years suppose we have a loan duration of 5 years i understand that we need to call the getparam function again if the input of years is a fraction but should we accept a input of 50 rather than reject it thanks
student,there are a lot of people asking questions specifically about the project but i think there are also people like me that have some linux and c experience but was not setup and taught how to do it at um yet like the people who took 183 and just worked in xcode so im hoping for those of you familiar with the reddit category can answer my questions and explain like i am 5 1 so i know how to move around through the terminal and the basic functions but i dont know what the best practices are in the caen environment im sshing into it with a mac via my terminal how do i copy those files into a folder in the terminal this was answered somewhere before but it didnt work in my case lets also say that i want to copy it in my desktopproject1 folder 2 i have experience writing code in text editors but never in the terminal so obviously i can copy and paste code from a text editor into the terminal but that sounds messy im pretty sure i cant do anything with gedit when i am sshing into the environment what do you guys think is the best thing to do here thanks
student,there seems to be a lot of concern over how to copy files from afs to a workspace via the terminal but i notice that there hasnt been much mention of mfile once you login you should be dropped into afsumicheduuser which is the home directory that appears on the desktop if you connect to caen with the vnc you can easily navigate to afsumicheduclasseecs280 and select whichever files andor directories you need to copy to your workspace then go back to your home directory and paste them there i created some folders for organization in my documents directory youll still need to learn to work with the files but for some this might make it easier to move project files from afs to a private workspace on caen of course mfile gives you access to much more than eecs projects as well you also have access to your mprint directory your website directory etc
student,for those who use google chrome are you having trouble viewing the schedule tab for this class on ctools i want to see office hours on the calendar i tried viewing the schedule tab in internet explorer and it worked fine can anyone please help me out thanks
student,i am an lsa student and also wrote my programs in xcode in eecs 183 how do i get a caen account and once i get an account is that where i can access the compiler used in this class
student,this might be a stupid question but why does the interest change every month im not used to the terms provided in the specs
student,so i saved all of the relevant files including my version of p1cpp and when i type in the line the spec gives to compile p1 the terminal tells me no such file or directory im pretty sure it is compiling because it tells me what i need to fix when i try to compile it with errors but the code is definitely not running any thoughts on what the problem might be thanks
student,in 183 we could go to any discussion section that was to our convenience and furthermore it was not required this class has 5 of points reserved for discussion exercises however are we still required to go to the discussion section we have signed up for on wolverine access and not a more convenient one
student,hi quick question on project 1 function called getparam does it call all three prompts at the same time or do we do say getparamplease enter the monthly payment 1000 5000 sorry for the confusion trying to get better every day
student,where can i access the online book from mit that was shown in lecture
student,what exactly is the first project asking of us i mean i get that we are supposed to calculate the loan amount given the monthly payment interest rate and loan duration but how am i supposed to incorporate the iocpp into my p1cpp i think this has something to do with calling a function but im not sure how to do thati have never learned it with the experience i have with programming also is this intended to be a short project with few codes of line
student,so we can do our project in any environment we want for me xcode is the option then we have to test our project in linux environment i am curious about this part can anyone explain it in an easy way although i know it would be discussed in the section i want to get an idea in advance thanks
student,piazza is a qa platform designed to get you great answers from classmates and instructors fast weve put together this list of tips you might find handy as you get started 1 ask questions the best way to get answers is to ask questions ask questions on piazza rather than emailing your teaching staff so everyone can benefit from the response and so you can get answers from classmates who are up as late as you are 2 edit questions and answers wikistyle think of piazza as a qa wiki for your class every question has just a single students answer that students can edit collectively and a single instructors’ answer for instructors 3 add a followup to comment or ask further questions to comment on or ask further questions about a post start a followup discussion mark it resolved when the issue has been addressed and add any relevant information back into the qa above 4 go anonymous shy no problem you can always opt to post or edit anonymously 5 tag your posts its far more convenient to find all posts about your homework 3 or midterm 1 when the posts are tagged type a “” before a key word to tag click a blue tag in a post or the question feed to filter for all posts that share that tag 6 format code and equations adding a code snippet click the pre or tt button in the question editor to add preformatted or inline teletype text mathematical equation click the fx button to access the latex editor to build a nicely formatted equation 7 view and download class details and resources click the course page button in your top bar to access the class syllabus staff contact information office hours details and course resources—all in one place contact the piazza team anytime with questions or comments at teampiazzacom we love feedback

student,i would like to see the mistakes i made curiosity is killing me if possible could i see my exam
student,i had gotten to thinking about tail call recursion and compiler optimization of it today and realized its maybe not always safe to do looking at clangs output llvm 35 if it matters i see for a trivial example it does indeed optimize away tail call recursion int facttailhelperint n int sofar if n 1 return sofar else return facttailhelpern1 nsofar becomes the following z15facttailhelperii z15facttailhelperii cfistartproc bb0 pushq rbp ltmp2 cfidefcfaoffset 16 ltmp3 cfioffset rbp 16 movq rsp rbp ltmp4 cfidefcfaregister rbp jmp lbb02 align 4 0x90 lbb01 tailrecurse in loop headerbb02 depth1 imull edi esi decl edi lbb02 tailrecurse this inner loop header depth1 cmpl 1 edi jne lbb01 bb3 tailrecursecritedge movl esi eax popq rbp retq cfiendproc its straightforward to see the base case where we compare against 1 jump otherwise to the integer multiply and decrement of n and loop as needed for the recursive case but because this is c we can break this fragile optimization rather easily for example make the functionscope ending brace do something significant by allocating an object on the stack that has a nontrivial destructor are there any more subtle things we should watch out for because they would cause such an optimization to not be done is there a safe way to still optimize here even though we potentially have a destructor to worry about hopefully such a question is not totally ill suited to piazza even though the semester is over thanks for everything gsis professors and students alike d
student,i guess this is just a curious question im an ee and i have no time to take any further cs classes but i have really enjoyed it does anyone have any advice or opinions on what good independent projects would be to keep up my cs skills
student,for those of you who did the surveys for the extra credit right before exams is it indicated on your gradebook i did them but my survey extra credit still shows us as a 02 yes i did forward the ctools evaluation confirmation to the eecsevals email
student,thanks for grading everything so quickly
student,
student,what is the policy regarding retaking eecs 280 if we passed
student,
student,what should i do for a final regrade
student,i was told under my grading comments to resubmit lab11 because the file i sent got messed up should i email the correct cpp file to one of the teaching staff since i cant resubmit on the assignments page
student,
student,i know the average for the class is usually a low b does this mean low b 84 or low brange 80
student,when will the grade distributioncutoff to pass will be included just based on recent years what approximately is going to be the cutoff to pass
student,what is the averagemedian for the final exam
student,i am taking eecs281 next semester so are there any good advices i can follow so i can do much better on the exams i feel like the exams are my downfall in these eecs classes
student,so i calculated my grade to be a 711 so with the curve is it considered passing
student,well after calculating my grade i am pretty sure i am not going to pass this class for those who were successful do you have any advice for the next time around
student,how will the curve work i know the average is usually around a low b but what about the grades around that is it by standard deviation or is it a straight difference in percentage from the average
student,will the extra credit be accounted for before or after the curve
student,i was wondering is there a chance for us to pick up the final exam or file for regrading
student,what is the distribution
student,i was wondering are we going to be able to pick up our final exam
student,what does the survey credit in the gradebook stand for the survey for lab how much it counts in the final grades thank you
student,does the email not include what percentage of buggy test cases we got correct i am guessing that is where a few points came from that i cant account for
student,is the grade on ctools our final grade or just our autograder score will we be getting another email that contains autograder handgraded results
student,just curious how exactly do we submit an auto grader request if we dont know what failed and such is it for things like style or
student,for one of my test cases it says the autograder detected a memory error with valgrind but i ran valgrind on it on my own then and just now and it says it is ok i was wondering where this discrepancy comes from
student,i know its super soon but i was curious as to when the due date for the final grades is
student,hey all just wanted to say good luck on the exam for everyone and thanks for the instructors for really helping us learn more on the magical world of coding heres to the crazier world of eecs 281 in the future
student,if you throw an exception that is inside of a try block how is that different from throwing an exception outside of a try block prof deorio said in the ecxeptions lecture at about 108 that we were not inside a try block i was just wondering what would happen if in fact we were inside of one also does there always have to be a try block before one or more catch blocks or could we just have a stand alone catch
student,how can we iterate through the members of intvector without being able to work with an iterator class in the apply function
student,in the implementation of listh from lecture the assignment operator overload has a signature list operator stuff while the iterators increment operator overload has a signature iterator operator stuff note how for list the is placed right before operator while for iterator the is placed right after iterator instead is this difference significant in any way
student,slightly confused on how you would move through the list of pointers in this situation can anyone give me a hand
student,what happens if the variable that is thrown has no catch block that matches its type will the program just crash
student,what it says on the tin i visited my friend here when she was an undergrad about seven years ago and i know where the large north campus library is and the general layout from entering whatever road it is thats just off of the road with the hospital and angelos on it to the dorms but building names are beyond my recollection additionally does anyone know the closest place to park with the student orange permit that will not result in fees incurredmy car getting towed i commute from quit a distance and usually park in the stadium lot there are maps and the like i know but ive actually always been abysmal at reading them i tend to mix the left and right sides up and always end up the opposite direction from where i need to go
student,if the catchbase cbase was written before catchderived cderived would that execute instead
student,is there a difference between them
student,im having trouble figuring out how we would add a new node to evenlist we dont have access to its private member variables and so we cant set anything to say first ideas
student,which implementation of the listh file will be on the exam will we always have access to the functions insertback insertfront iterator class etc or will the availability of each of these be determined on the actual exam
student,lets say we have a hierarchy of foodproducefruit we call fruits custom constructor does it also run the other custom constructors above the hierarchy like this food ctor produce ctor fruit ctor is this the same way a default constructor behaves too
student,i know destructors are needed when a class allocates memory dynamically…however if a class is not dynamically allocating memory it doesnt need a destructor however doesnt the compiler add one for you if you dont explicitly add one for every class im asking because in a few practice exams i saw that there are classes which dont use any dynamic memory yet they still have destructors with cout statements and all…so does this mean that they do exist in every class but do nothing basically
student,consider this code class rectangle public virtual rectangle cout rectangle dtorn endl class square public rectangle public square cout square dtorn endl my question is similar to the previous piazza post regarding virtual functions but with destructors what difference does it make when you have virtual in front of the base class destructor and not the derived class destructor and the other way around should they both always run because the derived destructor runs all the way down to the base class destructor is the word virtual even needed
student,ok so what if we had code that looked something like this class animal public virtual void talk cout hello i am an animaln class dog public animal public void talk cout hello i am a dogn notice how the talk function has virtual in front of it in the animal class but not the dog class what difference would this make in one of the practice exams some of the code contained something like this where matching functions in derived classes did not contain the word virtual but the parent class did is there a formal c definition of virtual that would help to understand situations like this also what would happen if the derived class function had virtual and the parent class function didnt
student,can someone quickly explain the differences between the runtime and compiletime types
student,is staticcast the same thing as upcast could someone pleas explain staticcast to mewould we ever need to explicitly staticcast anything thanks
student,for this question i know that there is a problem with the line nodeprev 0 prev is always null which messes up the reverse print function but i just want to verify that my reasoning for the buggy input make sense i guess that the regular print will work fine but the reverse print will only print the last element as prev is never anything but null for any previous node am i on the right track
student,for question 1e since we have a destructor we need a copy constructor and assignment operator right and for 1f on parts 4 5 and 6 do we need to do anything to deallocate the memory or does the compiler take care of it once void main returns and the a variables go out of scope
student,say this is the class hierarchy foodproducefruit and foodthe base class has a virtual destructor…and for each of the classes a message is printed for the constructors and destructors…the output of the following main code is added to the bottom my question is why does the destructor not run for this papaya object even though f1 is a local variable in the second example when i dont make f1 a pointer…both the constructors and destructors run…why the difference int main fruit f1 new fruitpapaya315 return 0 output food papaya constructed produce papaya constructed fruit papaya constructed ­ ­ int main fruit f1 fruitpapaya315 return 0 output food papaya constructed produce papaya constructed fruit papaya constructed ­ ­ fruit papaya destructed produce papaya destructed food papaya destructed
student,are the answers to 1bd a no a if not could anyone explain what the correct answers are
student,2a i think i understand how to generate an exact copy of monsterarmy i believe by running an iterator from begin to end it would create an exact copy im just not sure how to make a reverse copy would the logic be something similar 2b i was also thinking of running an iterator through the army but i think if i call delete on each individual monster in the army i would be invalidating the iterator im just confused as to the alternatives some guidance towards my faulty logic would be much appreciated
student,i was watching yesterdays lecture on bluereview and at the very end professor deorio says ill leave you with a dirty secret and right before he continues the audio cuts out what is the secret
student,if c derives from b and b derives from a and a function is declared in a as a nonvirtual but is then called a virtual in b is it virtual for all 3 classes or just b and c
student,is 4b just ifnummodvalue 0 sum sum num numvalues being worth 8 points makes it seem like i should have more than just this and is 4c just double sumd sum double count numvalues return sumdcount
student,in the following code int ptr new int5 int otherptr ptr delete ptr ptr null cout otherptr what does the delete line do does it delete the int that is on the heap with a value of 5 or does it simply cause ptr to not point to it anymore and if it does delete the value of 5 on the heap will the cout statement return an error
student,is there a c example of polymorphism happening at compile time
student,lets say that you have a class a and class b is derived from class a in class b have a custom constructor that takes in two parameters a string and an age in class a you have a custom constructor that takes in one parameter a string when you do the following piece of code how are the constructors called does the constructor in a know what to do with the extra information b bptr new b george 5 thanks
student,i knew it might be a silly question i was assigned to the last group and there was no room number its said stamps in the announcement does it refer to the school of art design if so which room should i go to
student,void eraseiterator i requires i is a valid iterator pointing to an element in this list modifies this effectsremoveselementpointedtobyiteratori uponusingthis function all iterators pointing to this list are invalidated this is the function rme for a function we are supposed to implement in one of the practice finals…im very confused as to how i can keep iterating through the list if i used erase…because after using erase it says all iterators pointing to the list are invalidated could someone please help me with how i can get my iterator to point to the next thing after what has been erased after the erase function has been called
student,can someone explain to me how to implement the two functions for this problem i am struggling doing it without being able to use any of the given functions
student,i understand that all constructors will run starting with the base ending with derived when you create an instance of a derived class my question is does the constructor run twice if you call the a constructor of a different class in the derived class constructor for example in spring 2014 question 4b class killerrobot public robot public killerrobotconst string namein robotnamein true numhumanskilled0 if i did something like killerrobot test new killerrobothelpme what constructors would run would this change if i did robot test new killerrobothelpme instead gracias
student,on one of the practice exams there is a class fruit which is a child of the class produce in main produce p1 new produce is called creating a pointer to a produce on the heap then later in the main p1 new fruit is called finally at the end of the program delete p1 is called so what is deleted they are both dynamic so i dont know which one delete p1 is deleting
student,how do you print out the number of replacement i dont know which function to use
student,for the hkprotocoldroid class the killhumans function outputs a message but it also has to increment the numhumanskilled private member variable in killerrobot the class it inherits from how can you both print output from hkprotocoldroid and let the killhumans function in killerrobot run
student,does anyone know the difference is it that polymorphic containers always contain subtypes and so instead of using a higher classs function you can use a derived classs and it will still work sorry for the convoluted question
student,will we lose a lot of points if we have a small memory leakage for 1 case in 1 function
student,i saw there is an office hour from 630pm 900pm tonight at bbb 1695 but i dont see any gsi in this room whats the matter
student,what exactly is a try block and why is it important is it just to remind us to put catch statements right after
student,can anyone explain how to do 4a im not sure how this function should be formatted the functor one
student,on the exam if there is a situation where a boolean lets say a flag variable is couted to the output do we represent it as a 0 or 1 or as true and false both are possible outputs of the cout stream depending on what the boolalpha flag is set to or would both be assumed to be correct
student,i understand that list did not have access to the private members of iterator so we added the friend class list declaration to allow list to be able to access iterators custom constructor i also understand that node is not a private member variable node is under the private section of class list the iterator class does not have access to private members of list so how is it that a friend declaration is not required for iterator to be able to create pointers to nodes if only the list class members know about the ability to make node structs i mean iterator is a part of the list class but that does not automatically give it access to the private members of the list class how does this work exactly
student,can someone explain why all of the dip destructors run first and then only the food destructors for jalapeño lettuce then ground beef run why doesnt all the the food destructors run after each dip is destructed
student,hey class lets say you had a double linked list container filled with animal pointers in this container there are some animal pointers to chickens and horses if i wanted to erase all objects that are of type chickens using the erase function that we had in project 5 how would i go about this my idea would to do a dynamic cast for each step in the for loop and then erase those that dont successfully dynamically cast but im questioning how i would be able to keep iteratorating through the list if i erased iterators that werent of the right type any ideas of how to go about this problem would be greatly appreciated
student,is 3a valid valid invalid invalid am i thinking about how to do 3b correctly it recommends to use insertfront but i couldnt think of a use for it i have written int count 0 int vote 0 forlisttiterator i csbegin i csed i ifiblockbillliberalmajority return false else ifivotebillcost vote count ifcountvotevote return false else return true
student,lets say you have virtual and pure virtual functions in a base class and then you implement them in a derived class and then you make a derived class from that derived class that only needs to reimplement some of the functions implemented in the first derived class if you made an instance of the second derived class and called a function that was only defined in the first derived class would it just default to using the instance implemented in the first derived class or is this illegal
student,so prof deorio said we should be familiar with intset for the exam what specifically does that mean should we know about its member functions and variables or are we expected to know all the code behind it
student,for the monsterarmy problem im still a little bit confused as to how we would decide how to implement the generatereversedcopy function using the iterator without understanding the implementation of the addmonster function thanks
student,for the overloaded assignment operator how come the first line is removefoodsif truepredconst food it seems like you should need something in the parentheses of truepered in order to use the overloaded bool operator or else it would just call the default constructor and also how come you dont have to set toplayer rhstoplayer how are we supposed to know that copyalllayers does this for us
student,are overloaded operators inherited by derived classes
student,maybe i missed this but i thought that when you make a subclass it doesnt inherit anything private from its parent class however when i was going through lecture slides again i saw that in the triangle and isosceles example isosceles does inherit triangles private member variables so is it true that subclasses inherit all public and private pieces of its parent class
student,my lab grade has been 412 for about 2 months now when will it be updated
student,i declared an object called comparepersonage age1 then tried calling findmax like this lastalpha findmaxpeople 5 age1 can someone tell me why this wont work i get the following error no match for operator in lastalpha findmaxconst person int comparator note candidates are person personoperatorconst person near match
student,i know that destructors have to be virtual in polymorphism when the destructor is run the virtual destructor for that derived class is run and then moves backwards to the base class for normal virtual functions doesnt it just run the dynamic type virtual function doesnt call the previous parent classes virtual functions is this just a special case for virtual destructors or is my understanding of virtual functions incorrect
student,when defining a predicate when would you use bool operator versus bool operator
student,is it possible to overload operators on the primitive data types ints doubles chars bools they arent user defined classes so my google search seemed to say no this is merely out of curiosity
student,does the following code run the default constructor for negativeerror in the throw line or does it just create an unnamed variable of type negativeerror class negativeerror int factorialint n if n 0 throw negativeerror
student,so i know about he liskov substitution principle and how to make a derived type a subtype…but how from looking at two classes that display inheritance can i tell whether one is a subtype of another i know if the inherited class can be substituted for the parent one and still work properly it is a subtype but how can you tell that from just looking at the two classes and know whether all the functions and operations will still work the same way
student,are we supposed to know the instances of when the copy constructor is used for copying as opposed to the assignment operator being used i subtly remember professor deorio saying something in lecture about how he didnt want us to focus on the little details of it but im not sure if this is what he was talking about when he said that how can we tell which of the two methods of copying will be used
student,lets say you have int p new int5 then you call delete p does that mean that the int5 on the heap is deleted and p on the stack is deleted or does p wait until the end of the scope to be deleted thanks for the help
student,where should we be able to find lab 12 the optional lab it is not posted in the assignments section on ctools where the other labs have been posted thanks
student,why doesnt bender dtor print at the very end doesnt benderptr get automatically destroyed once main ends
student,not all derived types are subtypes could someone give me an example of when this is true thanks
student,whats the point of writing something like congressman b new senatorbob true when you can just write senator b new senatorbob true does doing it the first way give some sort of advantage or something that im missing
student,assume that myclass is the name of a class with the big three implemented and that m1 is an initialized instance of myclass when the following line of code runs myclass m2 m1 does this line of code use the copy constructor or the overloaded assignment operator also myclass m3m1 would also run the copy constructor correct
student,just to make sure i understand correctly default copy constructors and assignment operators not implemented by a programmer do not make new copies of dynamic memory when copying classes because that dynamic memory is not a member of the class but is merely pointed to by another class member variable the dynamic memory is on the heap and thus is not in and of itself a member of the class that resides in the stack is this correct
student,why is the correct answer adding friend class intlist to intvector rather than the other way aroundadding friend class intvector to intlist isnt intlist the class thats trying to access intvectors private variables
student,finalexam1practicepdf finalexam2practicepdf
student,im having issues checking my code with labster it may be an error in my code this is a portion of what i have node np new node npdatumvecdata labster just gets stuck on the second line it seems that np contains the address of prev on the heap and cannot access the datum element of node am i doing something wrong here thanks
student,is ivotebillcost the same as ivotebillcost where i is an iterator whose node points to a congressman pointer
student,in the lecture it only says that you need to add it when needed the detail is too complicated when is it needed sometimes the compiler can go thought the compilation with or without typename some times not for example in p5 when i run make mytests locally it success fully did the compilation with sentences typename listintiterator itor but in the autograder it just fails i am really confused
student,i just went through the labster for winter 14 problem 4 and for the function apply a functor is returned at the end in labster there is code that this functor is inserted into that looks like functorfunctor other modvalueothermodvalue numvaluesothernumvalues sumothersum where did this code come from and how does it create the functor that apply returns
student,two of my test case files compile and run fine on my vnc but when i submit it to the autograder it says they failed to compile
student,when do you use a virtual destructor as opposed to a regular one
student,when the virtual keyword for blockbill is removed i dont understand why the last line would evaluate to true i know that without the virtual keyword we only pay attention to the static type but how do i know that the static type in this case is congressman i wrote down congressman from vidals session but cant remember why
student,following up on the discussion from professor deorios lecture today it turns out that the original designer of valgrind was julian seward and not dr val grind in fact his name appears under a copyright on the second line when you use valgrind on a side note you too can become a developer of the all powerful valgrind httpvalgrindorginfodevelopershtml
student,hi im doing lab12 and at the very end of task 2 were supposed to write code in int main to call the functor to identify people of age 16 my code looks like myagen is116 identifypeople n is1 however the compiler doesnt like it because it says theres no match for call in function void identifyconst person int predicate with predicate isagen error no match for call to isagen const person note candidates are bool isagenoperatorconst person what am i doing wrong
student,what exactly is the problem with protected member variables from the lecture slides it seems that the problem is that it is easy to use or change only the variables that the programmer or user wants to change directly without changing other variables eg acute in lecture 11 that also need to change with the desired variables is this the issue are there other problems with protected variables beyond this
student,can we assume that the and the and the operators for the iterators would not be called on invalid iterators or iterators that nodeptrs point to null
student,exceptionspng if this code were slightly changed so that inside of class helloerror catchgoodbyeerror x cout caught endl what would happen next caught would output to the stream and the would the next output to the stream be donen since there were no more errors thrown up to this point
student,i was testing my code and i realized that if i want to exit the program by typing ctrld in the linux terminal it requires that i type it twice if it is in the same line with other commands it exits the program with only typing ctrld once when its in a new line or at the end of file and everything else works fine i was wondering if this would be a problem thank yall
student,i am really stuck on problem 3a where should i start
student,after looking into a compilation error on the autograder i discovered that if a test case file doesnt have using namespace std it will fail because it will try and use them from the other files hopefully this might help someone struggling or the instructors next time good luck
student,for the list iterator operators specifically and are we supposed to be comparing the datum objectvalue or are we supposed to be comparing the node pointer thanks
student,i noticed that on both of the practice tests and on the final review that there any mention of big o and comparing efficiency of functions though there was some mention of it in one of the lectures what should we expect concerning the big o for the exam
student,how not what etc do i write code that properly tests these i think i asked a question about this earlier but i cant remember was it deleted do we need to test these our current test file fails probably because we arent writing the tests correctly but doesnt assert properly or cout the things before any asserts that might fail it
student,ive taken the end of class survey twice so far and still havent received the confirmation email you need to forward to eecsevalumichedu its been amount 20 minutes since the first attempt does it usually take longer than this
student,when i submit my submittargz i get an error saying i am missing listh everything seems to be fine when i enter make tar also when i attempt to download my submission all i get is a folder with nothing it it not sure whats going wrong here
student,where should i start on proeject 5 can i get some tips or something thanks a lot 3 eecs 280 fam
student,i know having check invariants function in rational would be a very good idea but is it required for this project
student,our calc tests are only different where a space may be concerned but we cant tell wherewhat to do it doesnt seem like there is even any differences with spacesblank spaces but we just cant tell any advice
student,what happens when you do this int main listt li other code i know you have to declare the type in main but would it just be a compiler error
student,i am not understanding what is the point of having member variables in the abstract base class if you wont be able to create an instance of the abstract base class
student,how do we make a file write to this again
student,is erasei valid when i listend list is not empty
student,i ran one of my test files with valgrind and got the message in the title and im confused as to what this meanshow i can fix it
student,this may be a ridiculous question the overloaded assignment operator does the same thing as the copy constructor besides deleting the original array would it be appropriate to just call the copy ctor inside the overloaded assignment operator or is that just not possible it seems like the best possible situation without re writing code
student,do we need to define the predicate class in stackh or have a standard library include for our countif function
student,for number 6 a a3 new anull runs ctor aint ptrin ptrptrin so now a3 new null ptr how would you correctly deallocate memory here
student,grouptxt is not part of the make tar so how is it known who our partner is
student,how do we go about testing for iterators our current test for them doesnt pass but it doesnt assert or cout anything inside the file
student,should we test the big three functions if we included them in list i just want to make sure so that my test files wont give a compiler error when used this has been asked before but no instructors answered
student,running test listcompilecheck compilation failed but all my listtest cases pass and listh compiles so why does it say that
student,just as a general question i know that destructors should be virtual when there are virtual functions should constructors ever be virtual
student,would someone be kind and paste the full proper code for making the tar file we have to submit when i use whats given in the make file it keeps saying command not found so i know im probably doing something wrong thanks
student,why does it say your calccpp may include iostream string cstdlib cassert cmath no other system header files may be included i have rationalh and stackh and using namespace std and listh am i not allowed to have those
student,when are the official statistics going to be shown
student,i am really confused by how to implement this function i tried to do it in labster but it keeps crashing on me can anyone help me understand this
student,is 0 automatically converted to 0 in c without us having to do anything i ask this because i made a rational test case for numerator 2 denominator 0 hoping to change it to 10 i found that it was correctly changed to 10 but in my if statement that requires that the numerator is positive which 2 is and the denominator is equal to zero not negative zero
student,i have a problem with my stack overloaded operator the thing that prints the stack when i go to make statcktest00 i get the error message tmpccnhqywcostacktest00cpptext0x108 undefined reference to stdostream operator intstdostream stackint const tmpccnhqywcostacktest00cpptext0x108 relocation truncated to fit rx8664pc32 against undefined symbol stdostream operator intstdostream stackint const collect2 error ld returned 1 exit status makefile25 recipe for target stacktest00 failed make stacktest00 error 1 i for the life of me cannot figure this out and i dont know what to do any help or suggestions are appreciated
student,just to confirm test cases for list will be the only ones we are graded on right
student,are solutions for the practice exams going to be released
student,is it necessarily true that a correctly implemented iterator for list must begin at the first element of list would it also be considered correct if it started at the last element of list in other words what is the bareminimum behavior for an iterator for it to be considered correctly implemented i am asking this in the context of listtest files so that i do not accidentally call a correct implementation buggy
student,we dont need to have the big three in stack correct because it doenst create its own dynamic memory please help
student,how come in this overloaded function rhs is accessed with the isnt iterator a pointer bool operator iterator rhs const return nodeptr rhsnodeptr thanks
student,so for whatever reason the autograder doesnt recognize the listh thats in my submission file help
student,in stackh the countif function has a pred arguement int stacktcountifpredicate pred const i compile my calccpp and countif works fine i compile my stacktest00 and it will not compile in calc i pass countif a rational instance in the stack test countif is being passed a bool well my countif uses an iterator if pred i but my calculator will not work with the syntax if pred i
student,if in lisths insert method listbegin is usually valid input however if the list is empty should the empty listbegin iterator be assessed as valid input in other words should we expect erase to run if the list is empty also should listend be counted as valid input for erase at any time
student,for the assignment operator do we delete the list that is passed in first we werent deleting at all also for the copy constructor we just initialized the member variables by doing first null last null
student,the only test cases we submit with p5 are ourlist test cases is this correct
student,i was playing with some code from lab09 on vectors and came across the below in my grow function why is it that the first example works but the second doesntcauses memory or segfault problems it breaks when i delete data and says pointer being freed was not allocated void arrayintvectorgrow int temp new intdatacapacity2 forint i 0 i numelements i tempi datai delete data data temp datacapacity 2 checkinvariants cout grow was called capacity is now datacapacity endl void arrayintvectorgrow arrayintvector temp datacapacity2 forint i 0 i numelements i tempdatai datai delete data data tempdata datacapacity 2 checkinvariants cout grow was called capacity is now datacapacity endl
student,are comparing undefined pos infinity and neg infinity values valid comparisons
student,pressing ctrl d in the terminal causes my program to go into an infinite loop is this the expected result or should it terminate
student,i have currently implemented iterator class in public part of listh however spec says do not change public of listh it does not make sense to have iterator as a class outside of list or in private please give me a hint
student,what happens when one tries to output undefined 00 and either infinity 10 or 10 values
student,are we allowed to have the friend declaration also have the function implementation it does not work for us otherwise
student,in the lecture slides there was assertisempty in the first line of each functions implementation in the h file am i supposed to keep these asserts when i submit or should i get rid of them
student,i am really confused by the spec sheet and i had my iterator classes implemented where they were declared but i heard that youre supposed to implement them later what exactly are we allowed to edit i declared some functions public in iterator aswell
student,would it be 10 or 10 thanks
student,the spec says we do not have to account for invalid input but are we allowed to i find it easier to usetest my calculator if i output an error message for example when inputting 3 to an empty stack instead of throwing my program into an error will having this error checking and output mess up the autograder technically it shouldnt because we arent supposed to be given invalid input but i want to see if anyone else has experience or knowledge with this
student,in rational should 1515 00 or 01
student,i am having trouble with the syntax of calling the overloaded operator from stack within calccpp i have a stack s but i am unsure of the arguments that i need to give the overloaded function also any thoughts would be much appreciated
student,hello will there be a lab posted on functors before the final it would be much appreciated
student,are we creating an instance of the iostream and if so which should be included in the final submission i did ostream os
student,i got segfault when i call the insert function that uses iterator to insert a datum it will only say segfault when i compile it with o1 but when i compile it with g it works perfectly when i use visual studio it also runs without error i tried to use gdb to find the bug and it seems there is something wrong inside my insert function but it wouldnt let me go further as it says missing separate debug infos i double checked every line to make sure that i only call prev and next whenever the node is not null and now i really dont know what to do
student,do we need to write test cases to test for memory leaks and make sure the invariant is never broken i mean do our test cases have to be able to find these things in your guys buggy code
student,so for the second answer why is it false true true …if the blockbill function returns true second line of output then the last one must return false right i mean because according to the passbill rme it says if even one congressman blocks the bill then the bill does not pass …doesnt that mean that if the second line of code is true…the last must be false can someone please explain this to me
student,if our test cases seg fault how do we go about fixing whats wrong im not really familiar with debugging and the like
student,hello all for my print all function there is a problem where entering the following produces a segfault 1 2 1 2 a the segfault happens at a and i used a debugger to find that the iterator for printing the stack was going beyond the size of the stack the first element if 11 which is correct for this but then it goes and tries to print 637940 0 and then an undefined rational which causes the segfault if someone could help me find a problem here i would really appreciate it since im not sure what could be causing this
student,im having some trouble adding 0 to the stack and i dont really know where to look for the error using this input 1 2 3 0 a it prints the output 148966719232767 3 2 1 the numerator of the weird number seems to be different each time but the denominator is consistently 32767 when i run valgrind i get some errors but no memory leaks i am still trying to find and correct those errors any help would be appreciated
student,in my printall function the last number in the stack is infinitely printed this does not happen whenever i use p for example if i enter into the terminal calc 1 2 3 6 a 6321111111111111111111 in my ostream operator overload i begin the iterator at listbegin and continue until i listend and increment i using i any help or advice is appreciated thanks
student,my rational constructors automatically simplify the input to their smallest fraction so testoverflow doesnt seem like it should be doing anything for me even if i make rational r1100100 rational r234 r1 will be simplified to 11 and multiplying r2 by r1 1000 times wont actually increase r2 to potentially overflow it if my rational constructors simplify the fraction atomatically how can i test for overflow
student,what happens if an abstract base class has functions that are not virtual does this mean that these functions cannot be overridden basically im asking how declaring a function as virtual changes things
student,when returning this for example in iterator preincrement overloaded function or list overloaded assignment operator i get that this is to provide a reference to that instance of the iterator or list and allows for linkage however i dont understand whats exactly going on behind the scenes to make returning a reference necessary over just returning the value that could subsequently be passed by reference into the function when called again
student,if numbers are greater than 10 trillion my program cant handle the numbers is that too small
student,does anyone know why everytime i try to access something from ctools i get an internal server error error 500 its making it tough to test my code because i havent downloaded all of the tests hopefully this wont be a problem soon

student,there seems to be conflicting statements about disabling assert statements in stack some of the requires clauses require you to have assert statements so turning off the assert statements seem to violate this and putting define dndebug in listh disables the assert statements in the test cases as another piazza post said this should be fine after all testing is done but i just wanted to make sure this is correct so my actual question is should we do define dndebug in stack even though it would technically violate the requires clause
student,my makefile wont download from google drive when i go to download a screen comes up saying not found error 404 what can i do
student,listtiteratoroperatorxxlisttiterator with t int is private any idea how to properly make the operators of all kinds
student,in calccpp im using a string for all my inputs can numbers be strings like 0 or 9 and i would need to static cast right before popping them into the stack thanks
student,i am encountering an issue where using any of the operators or letter commands in the calculator is pushing a 0 into the stack without a zero being invited into the stack by the user
student,can we add another private member variable to our list class ive looked through the spec and it looks like were only prohibited from changing the public interface of our list class
student,where should we be saying that list stack iterator are friends or how should we be doing this for the countif function permissions
student,do abstract base classes have member variables or not if they do not why
student,
student,
student,when we overload the assignment operator we first must delete the existing array then we initialize member variables finally we copy all from the rhs how can we loop through and assign eltsi rhseltsi if we already delete elts of rhs as our first step thanks for the help intset intsetoperator const intset rhs delete elts remove the existing array elts new intrhseltscapacity copy members eltssize rhseltssize eltscapacity rhseltscapacity for int i 0 i rhseltssize i eltsi rhseltsi return this
student,can somebody explain how to use a fully implemented countif function im not understanding what we pass it exactly we pass it a function but does that function need a parameter of its own etc
student,in our code we rely on our rational number constructors to make sure every rational number created is in reduced form this includes when new rational numbers are created through additional subtraction etc do we have to worry about our overloaded operators for etc being tested against an invalid constructor that doesnt reduce properly in other words does every function and overloaded operator that returns a rational number need to check by itself if the rational number is actually reduced or can they rely on a single source in our case the constructors to make sure the numbers are reduced
student,when i try to type make tar in the command line i get this error make no rule to make target tar i am 100 sure i have every required file as proof here is a list of my current directory bash41 ls calc listtest00cpp rationalh stacktest00cpp calccpp makefile rationaltest00cpp grouptxt p5starterstargz runmytestspy listh rationalcpp stackh what could be causing this error
student,why is the autograder saying compilation failed
student,will the exam cover exceptions and functors
student,how are we to recognize if input is a number i understand for string we have to check what we might expect but for numbers it could be a multitude of things ive used the funciton isdigitinput but that gives the error cannot convert stdstring to int for argument 1 to int isdigitint any advice
student,how do you push a zero onto a list weve noticed that when we attempt to push a zero onto the stack through calccpp that it doesnt appear when printing the list eg 2 0 2 a gives 2 2 in list we use zero to show that a pointer such as prev or next is at the end and does not point to another node if this node equals zero how do we get it to link into the list
student,so in the given calc test the input of 1 2 3 r a a c which results in 2 3 1 32 1 i am not sure how it would result in this as it seems that all of the other tests refer to the top of the stack as the last elements i get that the reverse results in the 2 3 1 but i am not sure when dividing then results in the 32 1 any clarification is appreciated thanks in advance
student,since constructors both copy and default and assignment operator overloads are optional will testing them cause good implementations to fail should we test them at all
student,in my test cases i am trying to call lremovefront for the function copyall however when i try do this the compiler says error no matching function for call to listintremovefront const note candidates are t listtremovefront with t int near match what is the difference between what i am trying to call and what it wants me to call
student,i see why using cin is the way to go but how do we get it to read the next int or operator after we process the previous int or operator the user input is a full command not just a single int or operator correct
student,for my countif function when i try to compile it is giving me an error saying type rational does not provide a call operator my function looks like this template class predicate int countifpredicate pred const implementation i tried adding template typename t above template class predicate but that didnt work either does anyone have an idea what the problem might be
student,if one of the member functions is pure virtual in the class then that class is considered a adt is that correct if it is then is it possible for the adt base class to have a default and custom constructor
student,when i run calc with the as part of the input it takes in the other files i have in the folder at the beginning of my main function in calc i have forint k 1 k argc k cout input k argvk endl so if for example if i run calc 4 5 it will output input 1 4 input 2 5 input 3 listoverview input 4 liststarterh and continues to take in every file i have in the folder and never recognizes the as in put it never says input k i have no idea why this happening
student,for the calctest01 how is the last line of output 4 it goes 4 1 this is 4 adds a 0 to the stack and adds a 1000000 to the stack 1000000 0 4 then 10000000 undefined undefined anything undefined as said in spec so shouldnt the last output line be 0 undefined
student,when i use valgrind on the test cases im getting that there are no leaks possible but the error summary says 2 errors from 2 contexts suprressed 6 from 6 is this okay
student,while i was writing list and stack i made test cases for each of them and they all passed and they worked fine when i tried to test them with the unit tests however it failed to build giving me this kind of error any help would be great thanks
student,if you have an iterator that equals listbegin where list is empty and then insert something into the list can the original iterator be incremented because it originally pointed to null which makes it a valid iterator im getting an error when i insert into an empty list the insertion works fine but when i try to increment the origninal iterator im failing an assert
student,question 1 when we are taking input from the user what type of variable should we use we are confused as to how to distinguish what the user enters from an integer or a character or an operator or whatever question 2 is an input that isnt a number but also isnt a letter that does something such as x considered bad input from the used that we dont have to worry about
student,i placed an iterator in countif everything will compile without the iterator for typename listtiterator i listbegin i listend i is the line that will not compile i do have another interator in ostream that compiles but the iterator will not compile in the countif member function in file included from stacktest00cpp3 listh in member function ‘int stacktcountifpredicate const with predicate bool int t int’ stacktest00cpp58 instantiated from here listh135 error ‘bool listtiteratoroperatorlisttiterator const with t int’ is private stackh194 error within this context stacktest00cpp58 instantiated from here listh106 error ‘listtiterator listtiteratoroperator with t int’ is private stackh194 error within this context make stacktest00 error 1
student,does anyone know what our calculator should do if the user uses a command that heshe shouldnt for example if you try to print an empty list should the program crash tell the user to enter something else or just print a new line
student,will the autograders calc tests contain a q at the end of the inputs or will we have to stop when the inputs reach the end of the file
student,the rme for erase only requires that i be a valid iterator ive seen it mentioned in several posts that an iterator that points to null points past the end is indeed a valid iterator what then should the specific behavior for the erase function be when used with an iterator that points past the end the effects clause just says the function will remove an item in the list how do we determine what item to remove if the iterator points to null what should happen if the list is empty or should the function do nothing in either case i guess im just a little confused by the wording in the rme any help or clarification would be appreciated thanks in advance
student,is it possible to pass all of the autogrder tests even if your functions are buggy as in they have incorrect implementations does autograder only check whether or not the code compiles thanks
student,should we do define ndebug to disable asserts or do we need to remove all assert statements from the files
student,i have an assert statement inside top and pop of stack to ensure that the stack is not empty as per instructions in the required clause and i just wanted to verify that this is correct since that didnt seem as though it was instructed in the list implementation
student,ive seen this asked several times on piazza but i cant seem to find one clear definitive answer in our list functions if the requires clause states requires list is not empty or something of the sort we should not have an assert statement checking input correct
student,of the four choices in this problem only the copy constructor is one of the big three how can we tell if we need other implementations aside from the big three given that we need in this case a destructor
student,if a null iterator is valid what would we do if we called erase on that iterator would we simply do nothing
student,i was wondering but is there a video for the final exam 2 review i cant find it on bluereview
student,when do we need to add using namespace std like what files do we add it too we added it to listh but im not sure if this is correct becasue the starter file didnt contain it
student,when we made the abstract base class shape in lecture we added a default ctor shape to it later when we made the abstract base class intset we did not add a default ctor why would you ever need a default ctor for an abstract base class when this class has no member variables or implementations further why do you do this in some cases but not others thank you
student,i am stuck on how to get countif to go through the stack without popping elements from it i tried to make an iterator of the stacks list but if i try to include the line listtiterator i listbegin in countif i get the following errors error need typename before listtiterator because listt is a dependent scope error expected before i is using an iterator the wrong idea and if not what is wrong with the line of code
student,i am trying to fix top in stackh but im not sure where i am going wrong i made an iterator to the first thing in the stack but i am not sure what the syntax would be to return the datum of the iterator anyone have any ideas
student,so i looked at the lecture slides for the operator and it was written t operator const nodeptr nodeptrnext return this this gives me assignment of datamember listintiteratornodeptr in readonly structure
student,i just wanted to check that my logic was okay with the following 1 if you have two iterators set to the end of two separate lists is it right in saying iterator1 iterator2 because theyre both null 2 similarly is it right to say that iterator1 iterator2 when both are set to the beginning of empty lists because again they are both null
student,does it matter if our static helper functions in calccpp are templated or should they take only rational numbers as input mine are currently all templated and they pass the basic published test cases but im not sure if they might cause problems with harder tests
student,the comments in the h file recommend that we test the top to ensure the user doesnt change the stack when calling the top function how do we do test for this currently my test for top is just asserting that the correct top value is returned should i just pop off all the elements and assert that they were unchanged after calling top
student,31871 heap summary 31871 in use at exit 0 bytes in 0 blocks 31871 total heap usage 3 allocs 3 frees 72 bytes allocated 31871 31871 all heap blocks were freed no leaks are possible 31871 31871 for counts of detected and suppressed errors rerun with v 31871 error summary 0 errors from 0 contexts suppressed 6 from 6 is the supressed 6 from 6 an indication of possible loss of data
student,should we be asserting stack sizes in calccpp for example for the command it requires that the stack has two elements should we use assert to enforce this or only perform the action if the stack is large enough
student,i am using a while loop to read in the commands but im having trouble getting my program to parse whether it is reading in an int or a stringshould a helper function be made to decide if it is an int or not or should ints be read in as strings and then converted to ints or how else could you do it
student,is there a reason this command would come up as calc no such file or directory i have all the files in the right folder
student,when will the project 4 grades be updated in the ctools gradebook and when will we know the project 4 statistics
student,in rationalcpp i made a function to check the invariants i want to place it in the rationalint int ctor but i keep getting an error message saying that my invariant checking function was not declared in this scope is it possible to use my static helper function inside the ctor

student,will the autograder ignore output in our list test cases like it did in project 4 or do we need to ensure that our tests are not outputting anything
student,if an iterator is equal to the end iterator implemented in the iterator class and we call erase on it what happens struggling to determine whether the end iterator is actually a valid iterator associated with list or not
student,i remember something being said about if you need 1 of the big 3 you most likely need the other 2 could most likely be changed to always and could i get some more clarification about how you need the big 3 if the class needs needs to clean up after itself and what that means thanks
student,so i know this question has already been asked on here but i didnt really understand the response when i typed calc into terminal it worked for a while then i made some pretty small changes and no i get the error it still works when i use calc please help
student,how do you send the output of the program to a new file again to compare it with calctest01outcorrect and such
student,im confused because one of my test files works perfectly in an osx terminal but fails in linux its getting completely different answers that make no sense in linux and im not sure what could be causing this does anyone have any suggestions i thought they were good test cases and want to include them but i dont want to if they may accidentally mark correct implementations as buggy
student,ive fully implemented listh and stackh but when i try to compile stackh i get the following error in file included from stackh90 listh in instantiation of ‘class listint’ stackh13010 required from ‘class stackint’ stacktest00cpp914 required from here listh1912 error template argument required for ‘class stack’ i didnt use a base constructor for stack could that be the problem
student,i am really confused about how to get inputs and parse them is there a lecture slide or online source that covers this
student,how do we incorporate lists constructor to work for the appropriate items in stackh any explanation would be appreciated
student,how do we distinguish if the input is a operator a number or a character
student,say you have list1 and list2 which are both list classes do they have access to each others private member variables like if you pass list2 into a function inside list1 can list1 access the private member variables of list2 since theyre both list classes
student,i have template typename t iterator listtend const which gives the error expected constructor destructor or type conversion before list any advice on what i should be doing here i feel like im not thinking about how this works correctly its only an error when iterator is the return type
student,i keep getting project compilation fails for one of my listtest files which uses a list not containing ints however my file passes make compilecheck and will build and run successfully on caen any ideas is there a bug in the autograder
student,so ive finished all my calccpp functions but i havent used the insert or erase list functions anywhere have i missed something not sure why wed have to write unnecessary functions
student,i compiled all my test cases in caen linux environment and did testing with valgrind to make sure everything works everything compiled successfully however some of my test cases fail to compile in autograder furthermore the second submission shows more fail than my first submission even though i didnt make any changes to my test cases can anyone enlighten me on this issue
student,i am getting the error error invalid use of nonstatic data member stackintlist for my operator in the stack class i have declared the function as a friend and declared the list class as a friend both in the public interface of the stack class is there something i am doing wrong
student,kinda a random question but its something ive been wondering for awhile what font is always used for code i always found it weird that code on the powerpoints and exams and everything was always different from the rest of the font in the documents this font is different from the font above and i want to know what it is and who came up the rule that this is the font that code should be typed in
student,will todays lecture be posted on bluereview thank you
student,between the last assertscountifcomparewithtwenty 0 statement and the test cases finishing i am receiving an error on an assert statement i put into my removefront function where if the list is empty the assert statement triggers i dont understand what lines of code could possibly be running after this assert statement however when i output something in the removefront function it outputs 8 times after the last assert statement of the test file why would the test file run this function 8 times this is very odd to me
student,just a quick question in instances when youre trying to remove a node from a list and the list is empty or when your iterator points to null and you call erase what should your function do obviously its bad access but should i just call assert statements in order to try and protect against it thanks
student,tldr ‘tostring’ is not a member of ‘std’ even though it is stdtostring is httpwwwcpluspluscomreferencestringtostring so for overloading rationals operator i saw we could include string when i was trying to output the integers we got through getnumerator and getdenominator i would use tostring to turn the integers into strings so i could pass them through to the ostream os passing integers did not give the correct outputs however when i try to implement my tostring it gives me an error saying tostring is not a member of std although ive including string is there a specific problem with tostring or is there another method i should be using
student,is there any way to test these sets of pointers since they are private variables
student,for listh and stackh do we need to rewrite the rme clauses for the function definitions because thats seems a little repetitive since they are already in the actual class
student,it seems that i have a problematic overloaded operator for my stack class it always prints nothing even if there exists content in the stack i have it set up as an iterator from the beginning to the end iterator that prints each element followed by a blank space however my function always prints a blank followed by an endline does anyone know any possible solutions
student,if you dont use the public or private keywords in a class are things automatically public or private
student,are we supposed to give datum any value in the default constructor for list
student,are we supposed to write test cases for the functions in iterator as well or do we only need test cases for the functions in list
student,gdb is telling me that i have a segfault in my insertback function for listh the specific line that results in a segfault reads lastnext newitem where newitem is the new node that im inserting at the end of the list i dont understand whats happening here especially since the line is the same as the one from lecture except newitem is a different node name can anyone help additional info if necessary im calling this function on a listint that already has one node in it
student,why do we have to put typename before declaring an iterator for example my for loop only compiles when the code is like this typename listtiterator it listbegin it listend it why is the typename necessary when it is already declared in the template at the top of the function
student,is it possible to pass all the autograder tests but fail valgrind
student,i wrote a helper function in calccpp that takes in 2 rational values and a stack what it does is it calls pop and assigns the above 2 rational values to the popped elements my question is i know that the 2 rational arguments must be pass by reference but does stack also have to be pass by reference i tried both and they both gave me same outputs so im a bit confused thanks
student,im in xcode and trying to debug this operator in stack by putting a breakpoint in the function but its not even calling that when i cout i made the function a friend in the stack class and am couting a stack variable is there any obvious reason why it wouldnt register im calling it
student,are the first and last elements of list connected is firstprev last and lastnext first
student,
student,i keep getting this compile error for the overloaded operator i have the function as a friend of stack but its still not letting me use the list variable the part of my code that its yelling at me for is my iterator for loop line 150 for typename listuiterator i stackulistbegin i stackulistend i line 68 is just were the list member variable is declared i have the function declared as a friend like this template typename u friend stdostream operatorstdostream os const stacku obj i think something must be wrong with my syntax in one of these two things but i cant figure out what it is stackh in function stdostream operatorstdostream const stacku with u rational calccpp137 instantiated from here stackh68 error invalid use of nonstatic data member stackrationallist stackh150 error from this location stackh68 error invalid use of nonstatic data member stackrationallist stackh150 error from this location
student,this happened to me where i did something similar to this delete np np 0 delete np and my program could not stop running until i manually broke it this is just out of curiosity what actually happens if you delete the same thing twice does the compiler just spaz and runs endlessly for inputting such terrible lines of code
student,if we use erasei the iterator i will then be invalidate since the node that i points to is deleted is this what we are supposed to implement erase
student,im running into a problem with calctest01 where after the final a in the file it continues to print fours for another 6000 lines or so any ideas on what could cause this i have my loop in calc set to while input q
student,can we make a private static check invariants function in the list class
student,do we have to consider every single possible case involving infinities and undefineds for all the operators for example 10 10 should result in 10 10 10 00 10 10 00 etc there are just so many cases to consider are we expected to consider every single one
student,if you do not define a default constructor in a class the compiler will automatically create one right
student,for the constructor of a drived classcan we use the parent class constructor in the initialized list
student,hi i am not sure but i thought that there will be an ungraded lab 12 and i was wondering when it was going to be release thank you
student,when will the grade distribution statistics for project 4 be posted
student,what should happen if someone puts bad input into the input stream in calc right now i have a throwtrycatch combo that outputs bad input and clears the stream but should we be doing something specific for the autograder
student,if we add infinity and infinity10 10 the direct result from the definition of will get 00 but intuitively i think the result should be infinity what should be the correct result should i add is as an exception to the thank you
student,
student,maybe im missing something obvious but how do i check which value my main function returns using the linux terminal the spec says that the calculator should exit with status 0 when i type controld but how can i find which value is returned
student,confused about how calccpp works the spec says the input is through standard input stream cin but then mentions that commands could be separated by newlines how could this be possible if the input is through cin also the test cases are separate files again how does that work with the input do we have to make calccpp work with either cin input or file input
student,what exactly are the benefits of using a iterator instead of just a pointer it seems to me they do the same thing which i do not understand why would you use one over the other
student,one of my list tests compiles and runs fine in valgrind but when i try to run the test outside of valgrind one of my assert statements fails all of this is done on caen linux is there any explanation that you can think of for this
student,i am just bored right now and so i was wondering what is null really is it like an empty place in memory that has random stuff in it like when i do int c null and then int p null do both pointers point to the same thing or what
student,is it okay to utilize office hours this week for nonproject related questions eg help with prepping for the examunderstanding material or should we wait until after the project 5 deadline
student,i am just confused on how come thislistbegin is the same as listbegin as i use it in stackh can someone explain it to me please
student,the way i was able to differentiate between a negative sign and the subtraction character was i checked to see if there was a space after meaning subtraction will there always be a space at the end of input commands otherwise my code will segfault with the way its written
student,can we assume that the numbers inputted for testing wont be higher than those that can be stored by an integer
student,on the terminal it says bash fg no such job whenever i enter calc i tried googling this error but only found this which confused me entering calc works as well as calc calctest01 does anyone know what this error means and what am i doing wrong
student,so when trying to compile calc i get the following error bash41 g wall werror pedantic o1 calccpp rationalcpp o calc tmpccypjsrxo in function main calccpptext0x2d5 undefined reference to stdbasicostreamchar stdchartraitschar operator rationalstdbasicostreamchar stdchartraitschar stackrational const collect2 ld returned 1 exit status ive been going over my code and really have no idea what this might be any ideas would be appreciated
student,are vectors a potential exam topic theyre mentioned in one of the assigned readings but we never talked about them specifically in class
student,just curious i know we arent supposed to run it but are we supposed to get a segfault specifically on the line that says mylisteraseiter iter points to null so i dont think you can erase itam i wrong
student,so when we go to test our code it is acting really weird i dont know if its something with memory or just some plain voodoo magic when we insert a random cout statement the calculator works but when we take out that cout statement it doesnt work meaning it just gives 00 as the answer from the operator similarily for rationaltest00 when r is declared r rational24 the numerator comes out 6304616 and the denominator is 0 however if we write the same assignment right below it the numerator is 1 and the denominator is 2 which is correct anyone know whats going on
student,hello all i have one problem with my insertback function in that it is causing seg faults when i have the node of the next value for the last node be the new node i created i know this seems right based on lecture material but it apparently is not does anyone have any suggestions
student,should we delete or deactivate all the assertions like assertlistempty before submitting to the autograder i am curious because on the requires clause it is stated that the list is not empty but i put it those there just for testing purposes
student,do we test listh and stackh with other types like should we test listchar or listgorilla and stackchar or stackgorilla i do not see the point of doing that since it is not relevant on correlating with rationalcpp and calccpp
student,can we use string streams in calccpp to help read from the input file
student,how do these differ from lisths constructors arent they basically the same thing
student,how can we test if we can change the stack by using stacktop
student,so im trying to work on my listh im unable to open it in gedit if i try to open it in another text editor i just get weird symbols what is going on here this is the file opened in gedit below is the file opened in gmacs did i lose all my codedo i have to redo the entire file any help would be greatly appreciated thanks
student,we passed 56 test cases but were failing the list compile check we also passed the listtestnn so what could possibly be the error please help
student,can i use the private elements of iterator class ie nodeptr in the erase function i think it will work i just want to make sure thank you
student,hi so whenever we put 4 0 p or start with a negative value it gives us assertion failed isempty function pop but then when we start with 4 0 p it works fine and calling 4 0 p afterwards also works fine what could possibly be the error here please help
student,are we allowed to put the definition for the countif function inside stackh
student,when the numerator is positive and the denominator should the output be xy or xy
student,can anyone give me advice on how this should be startedformatted
student,when i try to compile stacktest00 i get hundreds of lines like this usrlibgccx8664redhatlinux447includec447bitslocalefacetstcc277 error ‘foundgrouping’ was not declared in this scope usrlibgccx8664redhatlinux447includec447bitslocalefacetstcc300 error ‘foundgrouping’ was not declared in this scope usrlibgccx8664redhatlinux447includec447bitslocalefacetstcc336 error ‘foundgrouping’ was not declared in this scope usrlibgccx8664redhatlinux447includec447bitslocalefacetstcc in member function ‘initer stdnumgetchart initermextractintiniter initer stdiosbase stdiosbaseiostate valuet const’ usrlibgccx8664redhatlinux447includec447bitslocalefacetstcc446 error ‘string’ was not declared in this scope usrlibgccx8664redhatlinux447includec447bitslocalefacetstcc446 error expected ‘’ before ‘foundgrouping’ usrlibgccx8664redhatlinux447includec447bitslocalefacetstcc448 error ‘foundgrouping’ was not declared in this scope usrlibgccx8664redhatlinux447includec447bitslocalefacetstcc494 error ‘foundgrouping’ was not declared in this scope did i forget to include something i cant think of anything that i would have forgotten
student,i need help on knowing what is the result of 1 0 1 0 and 1 0 1 0
student,in the function void erase iterator i after we remove the nodeptr from the list what should iterator i be move to the next node or just delete its content
student,say we have iterator i i should point to a nodedatum not just a node correct
student,ive been trying to check for memory leaked using valgrind it seems that i loose the same amount of memory regardless of how many nodes i have also after removing the destructor i am still leaking the exact same amount of memory regardless of how many nodes i have
student,for calccpp i am declaring rational objects and calling a helper function to do some popping and pushing but when i declaring the rational objects in main should i make them static static rational a and if i make any helper function in this file should i declare them static thanks
student,for some reason my pop function is failing stacktest00 on visual studios 2013 but on caen it is passing i am not sure why it is doing this
student,i do not know if i missed reading this information somewhere but to clarify for the copyall function if we have a list l that contains 123 and we wanted to copyall of that list to another list k does that list need to be empty or can list k contain 4782 like for example calling kcopyalll
student,how much of the final will be explicitly testing midterm concepts ie trees recursion just trying to gauge how much to study these
student,so i have read the specs for calccpp but i am still unsure of how exactly we are supposed to do this in calccpp we are given and input file but other people are posing about using cin so are we inputing a file and calculating each line individually in the file or are we having the user input what they want any clarification is appreciated
student,i have been trying to call my erase function on a list by using iterating through said list once i call the erase function on the iterator i ran an assertinodeptr in the for loop to make sure that the nodeptr is no longer valid since the last line of my erase function is delete inodeptr inodeptr 0 and should delete the node pointer and in validate it however my code has no problem with this running and apparently my iterators nodeptr still points to a valid node despite deleting it earlier i am not sure if i am completely over my head but i do not think this should be happening
student,does push add a new member to the stack or just modify the order
student,for our overloaded ostream output if we have the special cases such as 00 10 etc do we simply output those numbers or should we print like as they appear in the spec as undefined and infinity
student,i understand were allowed to do inline definitions for 12 line functions in listh does this apply to rationalh as well or do we have to write all of our function definitions in rationalcpp
student,when i submit to the autograder i get the following feedback running test cases running test listcompilecheck compilation successful running test listtest00 pass running test stacktest00 pass running test rationaltest00 pass running test calctest01 pass running test calctest02 pass you passed 6 out of 6 test cases measuring 66 compiling student test cases student test case listtest00cpp failed to compile student test case listtest01cpp compiled student test case listtest02cpp failed to compile ive tested and successfully compiled my listtestnncpp files both on linux and windows any suggestions on how to figure out why the autograder doesnt like them thanks
student,say we follow the equation with the commands c and p is it okay to print out an empty stack or do we assert that the stack is not empty before printing because the top function asserts that the stack is not empty
student,is there a way to do this for some reason my stack is only printing the first member of the stack and it doesnt let me step into it to see what its doing
student,if you have an iterator that points to first in a list say the list contains 3 2 1 and you remove all elements in that list after you remove all elements when you derefence your iterator it should now point to 0 when i dereference the iterator it gives 3 even though 3 is no longer first in the list
student,calccpp in function u2018int mainu2019 calccpp57 error u2018coutu2019 is not a member of u2018stackrationalu2019 in file included from calccpp3 stackh in function u2018stdostream operatorstdostream const stacku with u rationalu2019 above are some of the errors we are getting on calccpp…any idea what is going wrong
student,do we need to write our own tests for rationalcpp the spec isnt necesarily clear on this and rationaltest00cpp seems pretty i havent looked at it to closely thanks harry
student,when i use the sample input files i use shell redirection to save the output somewhere and i run something like calc calctest01in calctest01out but when i do this it creates the correct calctest01out file but it doesnt lt me quit the program nor does it respond to any commands after that im wondering if this is a problem and how to go about addressing it thanks
student,i was just wondering what factors are accounted for when our code is being graded for readability my partner and i got a low readability score even though we use a lot of comments were hoping to improve this on project 5 so we wanted to know what to look for thank you
student,do we need an overview file of all of our test functions for listh like in project 4 thanks
student,in listtest00cpp i am getting a seg fault after it couts pass how can this be there is no code after this point
student,make calc g wall werror pedantic o1 calccpp rationalcpp o calc bash41 calc 2 3 p q q q q
student,is there any way to dispute my grade for a project i received 0 points for absence of playertestoverview but after checking my submittargz i clearly have my player overview included
student,we used a recursive version of euclids algorithm for gcd however we receive a seg fault if we put in two numbers like 1000000 and 1 because the recursive algorithm calls itself thousands of times so when we create a rational object rational1000000 1 we get a segfault when the constructor checks the gcd of the numerator and the denominator should our program be able to handle a number as large as 1000000
student,so i created a functor class for calc and was wondering if we need to put rmes and such for it thanks
student,can we write test cases for the big three in list copy constructor assignment operator destructor as well as the and operators for the iterator even though the original list interface does not contain these declarations
student,when i run make compilecheck i get this error in terminal listcompilecheckcpp51 error expected unqualifiedid before ‘using’ using stdcout am i allowed to change the listcompilecheckcpp
student,what is the best way to differentiate the char between a negative or a subtraction it just keeps tripping me up because we only are reading one char at a time
student,if we create a functor class for our match function do we need to declare the functor class static
student,i know the formulas we were given for dont always work properly so i was wondering if this is correct in calc if i type 100 200 a i receive 30 is this correct or incorrect because my rationaltests are working and the only other thing i can think of that that could be the problem is the formulas any help appreciated thanks
student,im having trouble looping my input stream such that it redeclares a stack and for each line of commands it performs different operations right now if i added say 2 2 as commands it will keep the 4 in the stack for the next line of commands before i was having the opposite problem where it would read the first 2 and declare a new stack and forget about it by the time it got to the next 2 any suggestions for this thank you
student,quick question is setting something to null the same thing as setting something to 0 and vice versa this in in regards to deleting something in lecture we see the code delete victim victim 0 however ive been hearing that you should set things to null instead just wondering if theres a difference preference
student,any explanations
student,for example 2 4 x
student,assume a destructor is needed does it need to be virtual and why or why not
student,httpimageshackcomaimg674790pttc5png
student,hello im still having trouble parsing the user input when i use getline i have trouble separating the arguments by whitespace when i use cin i am only able to read one argument at a time and not all of them any suggestions would be helpful thank you
student,i have an assert statement at the beginning of my removefront that makes sure that the list is not empty everything works fine however when i started writing my own list tests it keeps evaluating the assert statement before and after the last element is removed even though i only wrote it at the beginning of my function and it is therefore throwing an error that the list is empty exiting my program is there something about assert that it constantly is evaluating the truth of its predicate or is this something else
student,how would 2 3 5 8 be represented in the post fix notation
student,im pretty sure its suppose to be 1212 fri instead of friday 15 december right anyway looking forward to it as well as finishing off the semester thanks for such a wonderful class everyone
student,would there be some kind of limit on the size of a number you pass in to calccpp in other words due to constraints on certain variables in c can calling 10000000000 1000000000 cause weird behavior 10 zeros then 9 zeros
student,do we need rme statements for the big 3 and default constructors
student,was the autograder decktest00cpp the same as the published test case given with the project the only test we failed in the autograder was decktest00 but we passed the published decktest00

student,can someone explain to me what the difference is i was wondering how to dynamic cast references instead of just checking pointers at runtime
student,o hell yes o definitely not no o is the pope catholic o does a bear shit in the woods o no lets be real no one is going to choose this
student,
student,
student,i am having trouble with the single print and top function i can call the single print once but then if called again it causes the program to crash also after calling p any other command results in a segmentation fault i think it has something to do with the top function but i dont know what it could be as my top function uses an iterator but no pointers any ideas
student,are we allowed to use the cmath library in rationalcpp
student,if we pass in two improper rational numbers such as 10 and 10001000 and call the multiply operator should we 1 change referenced variables to follow invariants or 2 make temporary new variables that ensure variants of each input before multiplying or 3 ensure invariants after multiplying or 2 and 3
student,i noticed that for the files the spec says we need to submit for project 5 it doesnt include grouptxt does this mean that we arent allowed to do this project with a partner
student,how are we supposed to parse the input if we cant use cstrings if i input 24 32 plus other numberscharacters and it first stores a string 24 32 how do i separate 24 32 and etc
student,are we supposed to know about the specific implementations from the lectures for example the implementations for gorilla and the list associated with it are supposed to know how they work or will we be provided with a snippet of the code in the final exam if we are supposed to know about the implementations could someone upload the whole code online
student,i think im missing something very basic but cant figure out what it is when i do make compilecheck i get this error no matching function for call to ‘listintlist any ideas thanks
student,our code passes the test case but still exits with non zero status when we run it we also just can type a q to make it quit we need to force the program to quit we have tried to add in the while loop a statement with cingood and whilecin input thoughts
student,is there a way we could get more feedback on project 4 especially with respect to our test case suites i lost a lot of points for incorrectly declaring correct solutions as buggy and i would like to know more details on that so i can avoid those problems in the future
student,if i have static helper function for rationalcpp that reduces the fractions can i make it a friend of the rational class
student,are we assuming this calc will only do single digit calculations because if i wanted to do 234 the calc will not know if 234 is 234 or 234
student,should we just assume that infinity infinity infinity and inifinity infinity infinity the spec seems to suggest that we should not need to make special cases when we overload operators such as ie 10 10 10 1 0 00 00 but mathematically this doesnt make sense for operations like infinity infinity
student,on the recent announcement it said the final exam is on friday 15 december shouldnt it be friday 12 december instead
student,so if we make an iterator that points to the end of the list that iterator is going to be null but cant a null iterator also point to the beginning of an empty list i keep trying to account for this in my insert function but i keep getting a segfault
student,was the blackjacktest01 used in the autograder that was open to us the same as the one that you guys used for final grading because i definitely passed it on the autograder but couldnt pass it during the final grading which seems strange thanks
student,since we are creating a doubly linked list in listh when we insert a node in the front dont we need to make sure there are pointers going to and from this node pointer to the next and a pointer from the next if so how do we access the node that will point back to the new node
student,
student,stdostream operatorstdostream os const stacku obj inside this function implementation when i want to use templated iterator with some syntax like listuiterator it keeps telling me complie errorthe complier wants me to specify the u into int or some other specific type any ideas
student,when me and my partner submitted to the autograder some of our listtests had compilation failures yet cant find a consistent source of what would be causing it they all compile on linux with the makefile commands make mytests and make all correctly we included iostream listh and cassert at the top we asked a gsi in office hours this morning and after a good 45 minutes she could not think of why this would be happening does any one else in the staff know why perhaps the person who wrote the autograder
student,when implementing the list member functions why is it allowed to just do first node instead of having to do thisfirst node
student,
student,i am sorry if this is to soon but what are the statistics of porject4 thank you
student,i am a lsa student taking eecs280 i cant use my visual studio because the licence expired some of my friends also have the same situation since the final is approaching visual studio become more important to us because we can write a few lines of code and test our understanding whenever we want i try to email eecs280 staff but i havent got any reply is there are anyway that someone can help us upgrade our software
student,the rme tells us to return the reference rather than the copy how to distinguish between returning a reference and returning a copy
student,erase cannot be applied to an empty list but insert can am i correct
student,so defining the numerator and denominator getter functions seems like a super simple task but somethings wrong with my syntax and i cant tell what it is rationalint getnumerator const return numerator xcode gives me the error expected unqualifiedid help ive included rationalh if youre wondering
student,should we store any rational with 0 in the numerator as 01 eg 09 09 would both become 01
student,are project 4 grades going to be released soon just wondering because i want to know how my test cases were to see if i should take a similar approach for project 5
student,do we need to write cases to test the iterator class
student,i understand making classes a friend like list but how are we suppose to make a function a friend the operator function specifically
student,
student,we are having trouble getting our overloaded operator for iterator to compile the trouble seems to be due to the fact that we are returning a reference to an iterator and the compiler wont recognize the iterator as a type which might mean our scoping syntax is off the compiler is flagging the name of our function with this error expected constructor destructor or type conversion before ‘’ token our definition is structured as follows iterator listtiteratoroperator compiler flags this line with an error implementation any thoughtshelp would be appreciated we could circumvent the problem by defining the operator inside iterator but weve already done the other ones outside of it
student,this may invalidate other list iterators i am confused with this statement in rme basically what does erase do insert
student,im having trouble implementing task 1 of the lab without getting a compile error igetname works perfectly fine but italk gives me this weird compile error any suggestions
student,i implemented the overloaded operator for list however there is no such operator defined for the rational class since the rational class is used inside the stack class throughout calccpp there is a compilation error the message goes as follows listh241 error no match for u2018operatoru2019 in u2018listrationalnodeconst listrationaliteratorthislistrationaliteratornodeptrlistrationalnodedatum rhslistrationaliteratornodeptrlistrationalnodedatumu2019 what should i do
student,i understand that we need to use cin for taking in commands for the calculator but how do you know when all of the commands are done in a file you can do something like whileifstreamfail is there something similar for command line arguements
student,the h file says at the top not to modify the public inteface or private variables does this mean i shouldnt add member functions
student,in calccpp when we make the empty stack of rational numbers should we declare it as a pointer like stackrational or stackrational
student,are we testing cases when the variable type is char instead of int i know that we wont be using chars later on but since list class is template should we consider this as one of the test cases also what are some of the boundary cases to test list class thanks
student,how exactly do i use calctest01in to create an output file that i can use to diff check the two files its probably something simple but im not that used to all the nuances of linux yet thanks
student,i get a segmentation fault when i try to call any of my assignment operators in rationalcpp does anyone have any ideas as to why this could be thanks in advance for your help
student,do we have to do something to make sure that this makes the calculator exit with status 0
student,our autograder test results show that all our list tests compiled yet at the bottom it says all the individiual test files for list failed to compile could someone please tell me why this is they all pass in linux and compile running test listcompilecheck compilation successful running test listtest00 pass running test stacktest00 compilation failed running test rationaltest00 pass running test calctest01 compilation failed running test calctest02 compilation failed you passed 3 out of 6 test cases measuring 36 compiling student test cases student test case listtest00cpp compiled student test case listtest15cpp failed to compile student test case listtest16cpp failed to compile student test case listtest17cpp failed to compile student test case listtest18cpp failed to compile student test case listtest19cpp failed to compile student test case listtest20cpp failed to compile student test case listtest21cpp failed to compile student test case listtest22cpp failed to compile
student,do we need an overview file for list tests like p4
student,when i try to run a test for listh i get a seg fault when my int main returns i dont know what could cause this
student,what is the equivalent of 01
student,we are really confused with the match operator if the countif function is going through each item in the list how do we use it to compare the popped item to each item the iterator is pointing to i understand how iseven is used with countif but that is only taking into account the item that the iterator is pointing to but should we use a comparison functor but the predicate only takes in one input in countif
student,i dont understand how to deal with the fact that you need to use listanimal because that makes t animal which is not a class i understand why you cant use listanimal but how do you use if t is not a class animal chciken or horse
student,right now we are getting the right output except the sample test files they both end with a not followed by a q as a result we print the last result an infinite number of times however when we run the same test files with a q as the final command it terminates properly we think it has to do with the structure of our while loop in main how would we stop executing a when there is no q fed in
student,im getting an eror that says floating point exceptionany idea why
student,in the erase function we must correctly redirect the pointers before we delete the object that i points to but how do we do so ive thought of 2 possible solutions 1 is it possible to create a temporary node within the function on the stack that redirects the pointers to objects on the heap or do we have to 2 create a temporary node on the heap using new and delete that node in the function after the pointer redirection or am i just completely going about this in the wrong way
student,while we were testing that a command in calc our ostream operator goes into an infinite loop and keeps printing everything on the stack we tried to print the stack with the overloaded ostream using the iterators in a for loop with this condition for typename listuiterator iobjlistbegin i objlistend i we found that when the iterator reaches the last node i does not point the iterator to null it instead points to the same place this is the line we used to set the i pointer nodeptr nodeptrnext is this how the i operator is supposed to work if so how do we account for that in the for loop if not how do we go about fixing it in our list test cases we tested all theiterator operations and they passed
student,i passed rationaltest00 in the terminal what would cause it to not compile on the autograder
student,for the operations the spec says that the stack needs to have at least two operands what if the stack has less than two and an operation is input do we exit out of our current while loop and consider the next input or should we print an error statement
student,in testing my code on the linux command line giving the input 3 puts the rational 31 into the stack and giving the input 200 puts the rational 2001 on the stack but giving the input 200 3 places the rationals 2001 and 3001 on the stack in the correct order inputs are grabbed from the command line via getlinecin string and are pulled apart in a smaller loop via strings the string used to store each command is local to the loop and gets remade on each iteration and the integer variable used to call the rational constructor is reset as well using stringlength to obtain the size of the string shows 200 has a length of 3 and 3 has a length of 1 even though 300 still gets pushed onto the stack this error only occurs on linux command line not visual studio or xcode
student,what exactly do they mean they said dont do exit0 return 0 does not solve the problem
student,do we need the big three for iterator i am confused it has insert function indeed it allocates memory from heap this is different from the example in the lecture
student,what should iterator do when we try to dereference it when it isnt pointing to anything in list eg listint l listintiterator i cout i it segfaults so should we submit with an assert to make sure it wont seg fault
student,basciallywhat does this file do
student,im confused about whether or not we need a stack constructor i assumed that since stack only holds a list which already constructs itself we do not need a constructor however there is a piazza post saying we need a constructor and another saying we dont so do we need a default constructor because i am getting a seg fault and im assuming its related to the constructor any help is much appreciated
student,i was wondering if the input was rational03 would the correct output be 01
student,are we allowed to include cmath in rationalcpp i am just using it for the square root function i tried making my own square root function but it fails some numbers
student,what should happen if an iterator initialized with end is passed to erase is this even allowed by erases requires clause
student,when i run valgrind on my code it says that the entire heap was freed with no leaks possible however it says there are errors for conditional jumps or moves on possibly uninitialized values is this bad and will this cause a loss of points in the autograder
student,what files do we need to submit test cases for
student,are we doing something wrong if when i run calctest01 i get an infinite loop after the last command if i add a q it works properly but im assuming it was written the way it is on purpose
student,there is one post regarding this but wasnt helpful to me i am getting a segfault error on my insertfront function and i cant figure out why ive checked to see if the list is empty and if so set the first and last node equal to the new node i then wrote the rest of the code regarding the scenario where the list is not empty and cannot figure out why the segfault is happening any ideas
student,im having trouble interpreting valgrind where it says total heap usage is this leaked memory or is does this report mean im fine
student,are we allowed to include in rationalcpp
student,should we consider any operation with an undefined element to be undef for example undef undef undef undef undef undef undef undef undef undef undef infinity undef undef infinity undef thanks
student,what is the asterisk operator supposed to do
student,anyone else having issues with this single or signs are not working but if i put then it registers the second sign
student,when i type calc or calc or calc and try to run my program nothing happens is this how were actually supposed to be running the calculator or am i messing something up
student,im having a hard time figuring out the syntax for the stack default constructor i tried using an initializer list and calling the list default constructor but im getting an error i also tried it without an initializer list and called listlist inside of stack but thats giving me errors as well any idea how i can fix this
student,is list the only unit we are absolutely required to make tests for
student,a lot of new errors started popping up and im not sure how to go about fixing them copyassignment overloading stackt stacktoperator const stackt s how can i implement this if i cannot access the list inside of s this function should just copy over the list from s into this stacks list but you cannot use slist for typename listtiterator i listbegin i listend i visual studio requires that i add a typename keyword before the listt operator in the forloop is this okay error listtsize illegal call of nonstatic member function not very sure what that means
student,should we assume that when we do an operator like that we have two rationals in the stack or should we check that if we do check that and size 2 what do we do i know we dont have to check for inputs but i dont know if this counts
student,in calccpp are we supposed to create a functor that checks if each element in the stack equals the popped off element if so does this mean were just allowed to declare the functor right like the one below inside calccpp without modifying it with static class matchnumber my code
student,im running the published test cases and for both im getting an extra line printing out with the last number that was computed this only happens at the very end and im confused why this would happen for example for test1 the last lines are 14 4 but i am getting 14 4 4 this is also the case with test2 any suggestions ive been using cout statements to see where im entering loops and it all seems to check out i tried using gdb but it quits on me if i enter gdb calc calctest01in
student,a silly questionwhen does this mean returning the reference to the object and when does this mean returning the address of the object
student,t operator const assertnodeptr return nodeptrdatum
student,when we use cin to read strings in how should we be comparing them to the command i was thinking switch statements but they only work for chars should i convert the input to cstring and then use switch are we allowed another option would be to have several if statements to compare the strings is there a better option
student,when we overload postfix and prefix operator how do we know it is prefix and postfix since they both use notation
student,im testing my destructor on a list of pointers to dynamic ints and when i run the erase function on this list im realizing that erase only deletes the node and the pointer not the int that it actually points to for example listint pointerlist pointerlistinsertbacknew int pointerlistinsertbacknew int pointerlistinsertbacknew int pointerlistlist now valgrind says i have 3 blocks of leaked memory i understand that i should need to delete these pointers in the erase function but theres no way to tell if its a pointer and if you try to delete something that isnt a pointer the compiler throws errors
student,usually when we make our own functions we have to declare them as static in calccpp if we are making a functor should that be declared static
student,
student,in the lecture we have listgorilla zoo zooinsertfrontnew gorilla how can we do this from my personal view it should be new gorilla because you need to pass a pointer to the object to the function rather than the object itself
student,is zero allowed to be a datum that we insert in a list
student,there is an bug somewhere in my rational function causing tests00 to never finish running after compiling but i am having trouble locating it because an assertion is not failed and nothing is bring printed with cout i tried writing cout 1 endl as the first line in main in rationaltest00cpp but nothing is printed it still fails an assert0 placed at the start of main so it is running did i possibly do something incorrect with my overload to make it no longer function properly with anything else
student,so were getting a weird error when trying to assign the next node of an iterator passed in erase to a holder heres the error the compilers giving us listh280 error no match for ‘operator’ in ‘hold2 ilistintiteratornodeptrlistintnodenext’ listh54 note candidates are listintnode listintnodeoperatorconst listintnode and heres the code in question template typename t void listteraseiterator i node hold1 hold2 hold1 inodeptr prev hold2 inodeptr next the weirdest part is that the assignments involving the previous node arent throwing errors in both the insert and this function we didnt change any of the member variables that would screw this stuff up any help would be appreciated
student,we have been working on calc and whenever the a command is used printing the stack our os stream operator prints the stack forever we have tested the end begin and functions before this and they work correctly but after using gdb we found the iterator isnt changing positions in our for loop does anyone have an idea of what might be going wrong
student,i was trying to compile my stacktests but i have a compiler error that says something about listh242 the error mentions pointers when none exist on the line and when i move line 242 somewhere else it still says the same error on line 242 this happens even when line 242 is blank or commented i am working on the caen vnc i have tried restarting the vnc client
student,generically we use this syntax for templates templatetypename t in reference to lab 11 we used this notation listanimal compared to the generic version in this case is the typename animal pointer what is t
student,whenever i try to pass in the character into my calc executable it keeps giving me everything in the directory instead how do i make the command input recognize as the character and not everything in the directory
student,if we have an iterator pointing to the first or last node in a given list and we call either removefront or removeback whichever function deletes the node pointed to by the iterator is the iterator invalidated or should it now point to the new first or last element depending on the function used of the list
student,since listt list is listed as a private member variable in stack will its constructor run automatically when a class is created or do you have to explicitly call the list constructor somehow from the stack constructor
student,im confused on how to start calccpp since we are not given a h file or anything to work off of do you want us to make a calculator class or just a big calculator function that we can run in main
student,i want to use a functor with my countif function and my question is should we declare this outside of main in our calccpp file should we somehow hide this from the outside like something equivalent to static or private thanks
student,how are we supposed to create helper functions to simplify rationals and check invariants if we cannot access the private member variables denominator and numerator the specs say not to alter rationalh so we cant declare these functions as member functions of the rational class
student,move iterator to next position prefix requires iterator is not at default position iterator operator assertnodeptr nodeptr nodeptrnext return this move iterator to next position postfix iterator operator int assertnodeptr iterator tmpnodeptr nodeptr nodeptrnext return tmp note returns a copy this is how postfix works
student,can we assume that the nodeptr will be valid when we overload the operators for iterator i know were not supposed to submit with asserts but if we might get an invalid nodeptr we would require an assert to check that right
student,should 10 output infinity or just infinity to the output stream
student,for stack i declared the operator as a friend function within the class declaration as per the instructions in stackh but when i test the operator i get the following error message stackh94 error invalid use of nonstatic data member stackintlist stackh114 error from this location can somebody please explain whats going wrong here i cant find anything in the lecture slides about friend functions the lecture only mentions friend classes
student,when using the make tar and submitting to the autograder it says that submission archive is missing the file grouptxt and when i try to include the grouptxt the autograder shows your submittargz file failed to extract properly make sure that the following command successfully unpacks your archive tar xzvf submittargz you have not been charged a submission make sure that your archive included all the required files what does this mean
student,im having trouble writing the predicate for countif in calccpp i have a rational r that i popped off of the stack i want my predicate to be a function that returns true if the place in the stack its being compared to r ive been trying to do something similar to the bool function in stacktest00cpp but i cant figure out how to do it because i have two arguments instead of one can someone point me in the right direction
student,
student,is there a way to modify the python script used to run the test cases so that it also calls valgrind on each test case executable i have a lot of test cases and it is tedious to manually call valgrind on each of them
student,when trying to test the size function in list an error shows up saying there is no member name size in listint i have no idea why this is it is declared in listh and defined any ideas as to what the problem could be
student,getnumerator is a const function but in the rme for it it asks returns denominator that is consistent with the invariants after eliminating any common factors see invariants how are we to eliminate the common factor when we arent allowed to change the values because the function is const even within checking the invariants and when we do alter the values how are we to access the private member variables denominator and numerator is it okay to set the rational number equal to a newly constructed rational number like say rational r has numerator 2 and denominator 4 is r rational1 2 okay to do to alter that number obviously we wouldnt brute force every possibility this is just for example
student,are we allowed to implement a new overloaded assignment operator for decrementing in the iterator class
student,operator only works went i remove the const before stacku obj
student,im using begin to access the custom constructor for iterator but i keep getting an error telling me that its a private member function even though ive declared list as a friend class
student,when im writing the implementation for operator im not sure what i actually return the return type is rational but does this mean i return one int for a numerator and another for a denominator im thinking this isnt correct since numerator and denominator are private to rational so the operator cant access them
student,our calc is working for everything but the and characterscommands is anyone else having this issue i cant seem to find any help or reason why this is online it wont recognize the or unless there are two in a row we are taking input in as chars and checking if charin but this results in false every time unless the user puts two signs or 2 signs or one of each right after each other advice alternate approach
student,im having trouble implementing the printall function or the a command i want create an iterator to point to the top of the stack and go from there but im not sure if i have the right idea because stack doesnt have a function to tell me whether or not ive hit the end of the stack also im having trouble creating an iterator to start at the top of the stack
student,insertfrontconst t datum i am confused why thefunction parameter uses datum as the name since datum already exists in the list class as the name of private member variable
student,in our copyall function should the elements be copied to the front or back of the destination list
student,can you use a helper function in a custom constructor implementation for instance rationalab in order to reduce the fraction can i write a helper function that does it and put it in my rationalab constructor
student,are we supposed to implement the custom constructor in the private part of iterator also where are we supposed to implement end erase and insert right after the declaration just like begin
student,when the spec says that 0 is equivalent to 0 does this mean we need to check if the user inputs a 0 and correct it to a 0 or that the compiler will automatically recognize 0 as 0 without us doing any checking
student,when i run make compilecheck i get this error tmpccumla6wo in function main listcompilecheckcpptext0x101 undefined reference to listintiteratoriteratorlistintnode collect2 error ld returned 1 exit status make compilecheck error 1 this is the only error i get but i dont know how to resolve it thanks for any help
student,in the effects clause for this function it says effects print all the elements of the stack starting from the top element each element printed is followed by a space including the last element do not print a newline if the stack is empty print nothing if we have an empty stack and cout it and so print nothing should we just get a blank line in that instance though if not what would the proper output look like in that scenario
student,i wrote a static function to check invariants and i created a rational object in the beginning of my implementation to use getnumerator and getdenominator but since creating a class object means calling a default constructor numerator is always 0 and denominator is 1 how can i fix this issue is this the right direction
student,i know a lot of questions are being asked about what happens to the iterator after erase runs and i wanted to clarify something as i understand it after erase runs the iterator becomes invalid does this mean that iterator is now garbage and has to be set to something else for example you cant do iteratorerase and then iterator or iterator or do anything else with it before saying iterator listbegin again this seems to be the way it should work because at least for me the and other operatorsfunctions all require things like nodeptrnext or nodeptrdatum and these are not possible once erase runs and sets nodeptr to null
student,im having a really hard time conceptualizing stack does it just hold one list i dont really get what the point of stack is if this is the case like for stack isempty do you just check if the list member variable is empty whats the point of stack if this is the case and for size is it just the size of the list
student,in rational what should infinity infinity be how about infinity some number
student,i am passing everything in rationaltest00cpp but the string output which is confusing me because when i cout the results of my overloaded operator the answer is correct this is what i am getting as an error message rationaltest00 rationaltest00cpp56 void testio assertion stringr 12 failed 12aborted on the second line it even is showing my output which is weird because i am not even telling it to do that or so i think so does anyone have any ideas what i could be doing wrong
student,if we were iterating through animals would we do forlistiterator i lbegin i lend i delete i
student,i dont remember the spec saying we could us exceptions this makes me sad because httpwwwcpluspluscomreferencestringstoi
student,just wondering what should erase do when you are trying to erase in a empty list
student,i get a segmentation fault in my removeback function that has to do with the return value result i define result from my victim variable like the method discussed in lecture i checked the value of return before i delete my victim variable and there was no problem there however after i delete my victim variable there is no longer a value for my result could someone help my figure this out
student,what happens when we use a or and we dont have two items in the stack
student,how do we runuse calctest01in and calctest02in
student,when you input to the calc program how is it possible for there to be newline between different commands without pressing enter thanks
student,do we have to make the definition of a function before the declaration of a function each time or we can make the definition and declaration at the same time
student,should the erase function in iterator move the iterator to point to another item in the list or should it just keep pointing to the deleted area in memory
student,one of the lecture slides describes a common pitfall calling the base class constructor inside the derived class constructor but outside the initializer list the example that went along with this is class isosceles public triangle isoscelesdouble base double leg trianglebase leg legbad can someone further explain what is wrong in this example thanks
student,do we write overview files for our test cases like we did in the previous project
student,right now im trying to run unit tests on erasei my function works for the first element that i want to erase but when i reset the iterator and try to erase another element there is a segfault in the prefix operator at the line ptr ptrnext im pretty sure this is happening because of a null pointer but im having trouble figuring out to how to fix it any suggestions
student,my partner and i while running the following test given in the compile test had trouble interpreting what is supposed to happen the way we thought about the code it didnt make sense listintiterator iter mylistbegin mylistinsertiter 42 mylisteraseiter since my list is empty when you call my listbegin you return an iterator pointing to first and first is pointing to null so iterator is pointing to null then when you call my listinsert youre able to insert a 42 but iter is still pointing to null so the erase function will not execute properly any advice or does anybody see a mistake that we might be making thanks
student,im trying to declare an iterator in a function in the stack class currently i would like to have it templated to match the stacks private list variable type ie listtiterator myiterator listbegin this gives a compilation error error need ‘typename’ before ‘listtiterator’ because ‘listt’ is a dependent scope listtiterator curpos listbegin i have also tried using listintiterator to declare the iterator but this causes errors when the stack uses rationals how should an iterator be declared so as to avoid these errors
student,how do i know if what i am pointing to is a chicken or horse there is nothing to differentiate them besides whats can happen in cout
student,i am very confused as to how to store the values that you cin is using getline and storing as a str a good idea if this is what we are supposed to do what if the first inputted int is 22 how would we atoi both values together to store the actual int as 22 since atoi can only take a single char
student,im testing my rationalcpp with the test cases given and its not passing the io tests it fails when it gets to this part stringstream s rational r24 string stringr s r stringr readalls assertstringr 12 i can clearly see 12 in the cmd window so it prints just fine but it fails the assert and im not sure why im returning os in my overload of the operator thanks
student,
student,should we account for 0 passed into the denominator would rational4 0 result in negative infinity or positive infinity thanks
student,if we have a number 10 infinity when we overload the ostream operator do we output 10 or infinity
student,can we add member variables to the rational class
student,i am confused with the spec in the rationalh file i donot understand because there is no dynamic memory for rational class
student,for the p print command in calccpp it says the stack is left unchanged in order to access the topmost element i pop and it assign it to a newly declared t variable and then push it before the end of the function to replace it so the order of actions on the stack would be pop top element print top element push top element is this considered leaving the stack unchanged
student,the makefile that we currently have doesnt add grouptxt to the submittar
student,i know pizza has been saying we dont need to use functors but may we will it count against style points or something i thought it was easier to do it that way
student,are we allowed to use helper functions in rationalcpp i was thinking of making one to maintain the reduced form of all fractions
student,since past the end refers to a null ptr in a list is there any way to distinguish an iterator at the end of a specific list example listint mylist listint otherlist fill lists listintiterator i mylistend otherlistinserti 12 whats there to prevent you from using an iterator which points to the end of a specific list in this case mylist to refer to the end in another list otherlist since interator i null
student,we need to put many of the functions addressed in listh within another listcpp file yes thanks
student,for all the overloading operators should be return this to allow for chaining
student,rationalcpp66 error ‘rational rationaloperatorconst rational const rational’ must take either zero or one argument thats the error im getting for each of the overloading operator functionsany idea what i may be doing wrong
student,when i turned in my project to the autograder im getting compilation failed for rationaltest00 calctest01 and calctest02 rationaltest00 compiles just fine when i run it on my computer and im not sure what calctest01 and 02 even are they arent mentioned anywhere in the project spec and im not sure what should be in them were given calctest01in and calctest02in but how do we use those to test calc
student,i just submitted my project to the auto grader and though i passed all tests i get the following warning beneath my calctest01 and calctest02 warning your program exited with nonzero status pass i have included return 0 at the end of my main and the program correctly exits with a 0 exit value when q is entered is there something i am missing thanks note when running calctest01 and calctest02 input in the terminal i have to manually exit the program ctrl c because the in files do not have a q command at the end could this be my problem
student,1 word response please
student,when testing erase how do we set i equal to an element in the middle of the list if i is not the first or last elements where we can use begin and end
student,im getting a compiler error for pushit says invalid use of this in nonmember functionany ideas waht is going wrong im trying to use this to access insertfront my syntax is probably wrong
student,i dont quite understand the point of the listcompilecheckcpp test function from my understanding so far the function 1 creates a list 2 adds two datums 3 removes those two datums list is now nullempty 4 constructs an iterator that points to the beginning of the list the iterator is consequently null 5 attempts to insert a datum before the iterator before null space 6 erases the null pointer 7 attempts to the null pointer 8 attempts to dereference a null pointer in my opinion this test case is either a really hard corner test case or just an improper test case its also a requirement for the overloaded operator that the iterator is not null is anyone else having these problems my listh works on a normal list test perfectly fine
student,im confused as to what the default constructor should initialize numerator and denominator to would it just 01
student,to confirm that the invariants are never violated do you think ti would be a good idea to maybe create a function that checks to make sure all invariants are true
student,for the standard output of a rational number if the denominator is positive should we print it as such for an example say the numerator if 5 and the denominator is 2 should it print 52 or 52 theres no clear specification but the latter option seems neater thanks and good luck to all of you burning the midnight oil
student,im a little confused about how we should be writing things in calccpp do we write assignment operator overload functions for the various commands i started doing that for all the standards arithmetic operators but then i saw we need to recognize d r and other single letters as commands any insights on how were supposed to write functions for all of these commands
student,im working on task 1 right now and im getting a compile error i wrote my code using a double dereference of my iterator and calling the getname function but its telling me that theres no match for operator what exactly is happening
student,in rational how can we update the denominator and numerator for something when adding subtracting etc
student,im having issues using overloaded operators in my stackh file for example when i try to create a for loop using iterators such as for typename listtiterator i listbegin i listend i visual studio tells me error 1 error c2248 listtiteratoroperator cannot access private member declared in class listtiterator for every overloaded operator i use ive tried messing with typename double checked my operator implementations and made sure i had friend declarations do i have to use the scope resolution operator on the overloaded operators thanks
student,how do you test a destructor i ran all of my test cpps with valgrind and there were no leaks thats how i tested my destructor personally but how would we go about explicitly testing the destructor in our listcpp files for submission
student,i dont really see the point of the examplelistend function all it does is return an iterator with a null pointer cant we just make a null pointer if we needed one the only way this could be useful is if the returned iterators previous node is the last node in the list but this is not in the specs could someone explain the point of the end function
student,given that i cant find any other posts asking this im guessing im missing something in the spec but are we supposed to submit a ton of different test files for list like we did for player and stuff in project 4 or will it be ok to just put them all in listtest00cpp this time
student,i dont understand how we are supposed to be cin values into calccpp are we supposed to be reading them from a file in which case we would need include fstream and all that or is there a different way likewise assuming we are pulling from a file how are we supposed to pull numbers and characters from a the same file
student,i know that we should be testing all our classes as good programming practice however i was wondering what classes we must submit test cases for thanks
student,i read the spec and it seems unclear do we submit tests for stack and calc as well or just list obviously we write them for both but just curious what we are submitting
student,are we supposed to create and use a stack iterator to implement top i cant think of another way that would allow us to access the address of the top of the stack i thought of using a list iterator and setting that equal to listbegin but then i wouldnt be able to access the private member variable nodeptr of the list iterator
student,in pop i am trying to erase the first element of the list with this syntax but for some reason i am getting a compile error which i am not sure on how to fix thislisteraselistbegin
student,im trying to iterate through the list of animals im using a for loop and i have created an iterator i in the for loop im sure ive done this correctly but im having trouble accessing the animal pointed to by the iterator im trying to do igetname and italk but im getting the error member reference base type animal is not a structure or union im completely stuck can anyone help
student,im not sure how to implement a copy constructor for stack initially i thought to use the list function copyall but since i cant access the list private member variable of the other stack im copying from this wouldnt actually work
student,i saw there were some operations on infinity and undefined listed in the spec but do we need to worry about situations like 2infinity or 2undefined what should the behavior be in those cases
student,for stack do we implement all the functions in stackh or do we make a new file called stackcpp and implement it in there
student,where is prev supposed to point for the first node in the list after removefront null thank you
student,since the list interface doesnt have a way to return whats at the top without modifying the list for the top function in stack do we have to removeback and then insertback so the stack doesnt change also tops wants to return a reference to an item should i be returning a pointer then
student,what should inodeptr point to when i delete victim node because after i delete it doesnt inodeptr basically point to something we are not sure of
student,in the comments in stackh it says we should be able to pop and push from a stack in one line for example t item stackpopstackpushitem however the compiler is saying invalid use of void function is the syntax wrong or can you not do that
student,template typename t list listtoperatorconst list l my code i am receiving the following error expected constructor destructor or type conversion before ‘’ token what is wrong here
student,do you need a constructor for stack or does a constructor for list run automatically when a stack is created
student,in listh for lab11 the function declaration for operator is defined in the class list as list operatorconst list l and then where it is defined out of the class as listt listtoperator const list l why do we not have to put the t next to the list type in the argument also will we ever need to use t in the class scope thanks
student,where should the operator make the iterator point to when it is already pointing to null for example listint l listintiterator i lend i where should i point to after this code is executed
student,if we are calling eraseiterator i but i points to null then should anything even be erased also for the insert function do we have to move the iterator to point to the new inserted element
student,when we put in the operators and default constructor for listh iterator do we need to add in the line public iterator only has private member variables in the listh starter so im not sure if were allowed to add in public
student,canwill insert ever be called with a null pointer if so whats supposed to happen
student,do we need to send someone the receipt for our course evals thanks
student,the private data member is a list and i assume the list constructor would be called upon creation of stack for the purpose of creating the data member so would a default constructor for stack be necessary here also regarding the big 3 i understand that means the dynamic elements of list to should be deleted as needed how would i go about including this in my stack implementatin of the big 3 would i use the public implementations for list and call them in stack thanks in advance
student,
student,im getting the following compile error for stack in file included from stacktest00cpp1 stackh176 error ‘stdostream stacktoperatorstdostream const stackt’ must take exactly one argument im confused because this was the given function prototype
student,if there is one element in a list should the last pointers previous pointer point to null or the first element which would be itself and likewise for firsts next pointer
student,lets say you had a stack that was 3 2 1 and you said cout stop endl should the output be 3 or an address
student,are we supposed to allowed to use trycatch statements on project 5 for example in making sure the denominator is greater than or equal to 0 thanks
student,intuitively negative infinity minus infinity should result in negative 2 infinity which would simplify to negative infinity however when plugging into the equation for subtraction you get 10 1000 which equals 00 should we follow the formula for this case even though it doesnt logically make sense
student,hello everyone just a note i discovered about valgrind valgrind is your friend i ran my test normally and in gdb no problem but valgrind exposed a tricky segfault i had no idea existed all hail the mighty valgrind dont abuse pointers valgrind yelled at me for it i leaked some memory good thing it was just a node this time and not a gorilla
student,i passed all my tests except for two of them after debugging i realized it was because when i do two insertfronts i lastprev does not point to first but rather null i tried to do a few things but kept getting bad thread access any ideas or strategies on how to do this thanks
student,can we have partners on project 5 i do not see any mention of a grouptxt in the submission requirements or any mention at all whether or not partners are allowed in the spec
student,do we make a copy each time when we use assignment operator int q 8 int i q
student,did we just end all the classes monday tbd any ideas i am confused
student,are we restricted from doing something like euclids algorithm to find the greatest common divisor of two integers euclids algorithms wiki thanks
student,should we be checking if we are removing an element from a list with only one element in removefront if we remove an element from a list with only one element then first and last should point to the same thing and we would have to remove last as well correct
student,first question can the iterator point to a null such that its technically pointing past the end of the list if so would that mean an iterator pointing to a null does not necessarily mean its pointing to an empty list but it could be pointing to the end of the list then in that case for the insert function do we have to account for when the iterator is pointing to the end of the list so that it can insert into the back of the list or do we not have to worry about that situation because we have insertback also same for inserting to the beginning of a list because we already have a insertfront
student,bash41 g wall werror pedantic o1 listcompilecheckcpp o listcompilecheck listh in function ‘int main’ listh265 error ‘bool listtiteratoroperatorlisttiterator const with t int’ is private listcompilecheckcpp32 error within this context listh271 error ‘bool listtiteratoroperatorlisttiterator const with t int’ is private listcompilecheckcpp33 error within this context listh258 error ‘listtiterator listtiteratoroperator with t int’ is private listcompilecheckcpp35 error within this context listh252 error ‘t listtiteratoroperator const with t int’ is private listcompilecheckcpp37 error within this context i provided function definitions in the public section of iterator so i do not understand why the compiler is saying these functions are private
student,after fixing all my compiler errors in stack i got a compile of errors like this tmpccvbsl3yo in function testcountitem stacktest00cpptext0x4c undefined reference to stackintstack im not really sure what is causing them as most of the stuff online says this was caused by defining templated classes in the cpp file which i am definitely not doing
student,how would we declare an iterator for the member variable list in stack right now im stuck with listtiterator i but that isnt working
student,i believe we need to make the print function a friend of the stack class dont we need to declare that in the private section though however it says you must not make any changes to the private section in the starter files so should the friend declaration be somewhere else also how exactly do we declare a function to be a friend ive only ever seen it done with other classes
student,in our listtest files are we responsible for testing these two functions they are private members of the list class
student,my understanding is that the list constructor would automatically be called upon the creation of an instance of a class do we specifically need a stack constructor also with regards to the big 3 the stack class is not responsible for calling newdelete so im a bit confused as to whether or not it is necessary to create a destructor copy constructor and overloaded assignment operator for stack
student,should this be an empty list before we copy list l to it for example listint k kinsertfront2 kinsertfront3 listint l linsertfront4 linsertfront5 kcopyalll in our implementation of copyall should we clear the list first and then copy the nodes from l to k or should we just copy all nodes of l to the end of k and keep all the previous nodes of k the rme does not specify
student,for some reason whenever i run my program on visual studios my destructor is working fine but when i do it on caen linux i end up with a segmentation fault with my destructor i am not sure what is going on
student,i know when we call getdenominator it should be 0 or greater but can the user enter a negative input value
student,for removefront and removeback are we supposed to return the value that we deleted or are we supposed to just remove that node and reassign the other values accordingly thanks for the help
student,do we need to account for fractions being used for operations being entered into the calculator in a form like 13 4 in place of entering 112 or can we assume we will only be given two numbers separated by a slash with no addtional operations within for example do we need to account for input like this 13 4 512 in place of 112 512
student,are we allowed to make a overload operator for iterator
student,are we allowed to use the string member function substr
student,when you erase from a list using an iterator should the iterator be updated for example if you erase from a list should the iterator then be set to null or should it just keep pointing to the node that you just deleted
student,i see that we may in calc but are we allowed to in rationalcpp for finding gcf negative numbers are giving me some trouble
student,in the comments of stackh it mentions that spopspushitem should return item in stacktest00cpp i initialize stack s and then assertspopspush5 5 but i keep getting an error that this was an invalid use of void expression when i do these steps separately ie spush5 then assertspop 5 it works just fine has anybody else come across this
student,there is a common method to do this i used it before while programming in another language but i dont want to get in trouble for it looking a lot like something on the web do i have to reinvent the wheel and come up with a new way to find the greatest common divisor thanks
student,i tried to implement my size function using the same loop as was displayed in the lecture slides for the copyall helper function node np lfirst np np npnext and it works if there are zero or one elements in the list but once i add a second i have an infinite loop i think the issue is with npnext but im not sure any ideas
student,sorry there always has to be that one guy will the autograder be up soon
student,why do i get a segfault when i try to assign firsts previous node to null like this firstprev 0
student,stackint s spush1 spush2 spush3 i have two questions 1 what is the top element in this case 2 what is the output of cout s endl
student,when i run my test for iterator i use listint mylist forlistintiterator i mylistbegin i mylistend i coutiendl and compilor showed this error conversion from ‘unresolved overloaded function type’ to nonscalar type ‘listintiterator’ requested
student,is there going to be an exam review for the final like the midterm review vidal hosted
student,im having a really hard time figuring out how to update prev and next in removeback i keep getting a bad access code heres what ive tried i have a victim node that points to last i then make last point to lastprev after getting the result from victim i delete it what i keep trying to do and failing at is getting the new lastprevnext to point to last but you cant access it in this way without getting an error i tried creating another victim node pointing to lastprev and accessing it in a similar way but this didnt work either can someone point me in the right direction
student,i just wanted to double check what constitutes a valid iterator for the insert function if the iterator that is passed is null does that mean its an empty list that is being passed are valid iterators allowed to go past the end of the list
student,i am just a little confused about on how should erase behave this is what i think it does but i am not quite sure mylist 5 9 2 mylisterase2 list now has mylist 5 2
student,i am confused when do you actually use the list destructor and for what reason
student,do we have to submit an overview file for the submitted list tests or do comments in each test file suffice
student,i am getting this error for all of my overloaded operators for my iterator error ‘listtiterator listtiteratoroperator with t int’ is private i have no idea what im doing wrong i based my implementation off of the lecture slides
student,i was trying to use the top function in the stack class howeverwhen i did stackrational stack coutstacktopendl i keep getting the following error error nonconst lvalue reference to type rational cannot bind to a temporary of type rational anyone with similar problem thanks
student,can you insert into an empty list
student,i am getting this error multiple times for different functions when i run the listcompilecheck listh101 error ‘listtiteratoriterator with t int’ is private any ideas
student,where can i find the info on where the final exam is located thanks
student,since 0 is the same as 0 is 40 reduced to positive infinity or negative infinity
student,my remove back returns the correct value but when i call size after to see if the size updates correctly it doesnt really delete the last element if i have the list 1 2 3 4 5 assertl2size 5 assertl2removeback 5 assertl2size 4 it passes the first two asserts but fails the third in my removeback i set last equal to victimprev before deleting victim
student,im having trouble figuring out how to write the syntax of the lists overloaded assignment operator the code i have is listtlist listtoperator const listtlist l however i keep getting this error expected constructor destructor or type conversion before token
student,should the iterator have a destructor because if you delete an iterator it shouldnt delete the element of the list should it if the user actually wants to delete an element in the list shouldnt they use erase
student,im trying to run the published test case for rationalcpp but both on my computer and in linux im getting odd errors that seem to indicate that the stringstream library isnt being included in compilation heres a few of the errors in bash rationaltest00cpp in function ‘stdstring readallstdstringstream’ rationaltest00cpp41 error no match for ‘operator’ in ‘s stdnoskipws’ rationaltest00cpp in function ‘void testio’ rationaltest00cpp50 error aggregate ‘stdstringstream s’ has incomplete type and cannot be defined rationalcpp in function ‘stdostream operatorstdostream const rational’ rationalcpp85 error ‘cout’ was not declared in this scope rationalcpp91 error ‘cout’ was not declared in this scope rationalcpp94 error ‘cout’ was not declared in this scope to compile all i used was the make rationaltest00 command im currently unfamiliar with the sstring library so any tips on how to resolve this
student,in listhstarter why is the custom constructor for iterator private shouldnt it be public so a user can create an iterator
student,should the default constructor for the iterator make nodeptr point to the first element in the list
student,in the example listh file it has the etc operators declared and implemented in the class however i get errors when i run the listcompilecheckcpp basically saying that these operators have not been overloaded when i simply declare these operator overloads inside the class and then implement them outside of the class the errors disappear and the test recognizes the operators does anyone know why is the example listh just wrong
student,bool b iter iter2 b iter iter2 am i right that at the first line b 1 and at the second line b 0 thank you
student,im getting two errors that i cant figure out template typename t t typetiteratoroperator const im getting the error expected at end of declaration template typename t iterator listtiteratoroperator im getting the error unknown type name iterator thanks
student,do we need assert isempty in eraseiterator i thank you
student,are we allowed to use namepace std in all our files
student,should the big three be public or private
student,i was using the calctest01outcorrect file to check that my program is outputting correctly and i noticed that when print is called using p the numbers in the outcorrect file have a space following them it is not clear in the specification if we were supposed to print a space when using the print function it is clear however in the printall function but i just wanted to get some clarification from an instructor about the correct way it should be output in the print function the one that only prints the value at the top of the stack should a space follow the number or not thank you
student,in the lecture code why is the null pointer considered past the end isnt past the end the address that is actually one past the end
student,are we allowed to declare our own helper functions inside rationalcpp for example greatest common divisor
student,i am getting an error invalid use of incomplete type class stackt when i try to compile my stackh it is on the third line provided below template class predicate template typename t int stacktcountifpredicate pred const implementation what could the problem be are we declaring the templates wrong
student,these are from the lecture slides why do we delete victim we didnt use new so wouldnt it not be on the heap also why dont we use delete np in my code i kept getting errors when i had something like delete victim in my code and as soon as i deleted it everything works as it should
student,do we have to put template typname t above each member function implementation in listh
student,during lecture i was wondering why we used a functor instead of a regular function bool animalless const animal a const animal b professor deorio mentioned something about creating something on the fly for the greatern funtion it makes sense because you want to be able to control the limit but with animalless there are no private member variables that allow for greater flexibility
student,just to confirm using the formulas given 10 10 00 not 10 correct
student,im a bit confused about what insert is supposed to do my understanding is that the parameters are an iterator a pointer in the list and a datum do we insert the datum at the place before the iterator pointer so if we already have an integer list with 1 and 3 and i were to call insert with the pointer to the 3 and the datum 2 would insert then make the list 1 2 3 thank you
student,my tests for stackh all run fine when theyre put in separate files however as soon as i combine tests into one file such as the stacktest00cpp where there are several functions used for each test case in particular the size function and operator overloading function causes a segfault any help is appreciated thanks
student,when i am implementing my list member functions i am getting an error that says expected a class or namespace when i try to do things like listlist or listisempty what am i doing wrong
student,im trying to implement countif but im running into a few problems well one problem where each solution nets other problems with template stuffs im trying to iterate through the stacks list and checking the value against the pred function the main problem is having two typenames predicate and t if i try to have template typename for both typenames i get an error where there are too many typenames if i try to have template typename t inside the function i get an error where i cant have a template inside the function if i try to have either predicate or t as the declared template then i get an error where the compiler doesnt know what the undeclared typename is am i going about the countif function wrong or is this just a template typename tragedy
student,if this is called rational50 what should the fraction be do we just randomly choose from 1 0 and 1 for the numerator
student,so i am trying to traverse through the list using an iterator to count the size the only real issue i am encountering is how to use the begin and end because size does not accept a parameter am i on the right track or should i think about using the member variables in conjunction with this thought process thanks
student,i was going over this lecture and had a question about this slide professor deorio said in the lecture recording that colo lives on the heap however since colo is a local pointer variable to a gorilla i thought that colo is located on the stack while the newly created gorilla exists on the heap
student,i tested my removefront function and it works fine to implement removeback i just changed one line of code and now every time i call removeback i get this error listtest0140410x7fff7a3ed300 malloc error for object 0x7f8c8bd00040 pointer being freed was not allocated set a breakpoint in mallocerrorbreak to debug abort trap 6 can you help me please thank you
student,for iterator i in erase if i was to do something like iprev null first i would the first line of code where i do i make the iterator permanently move to the next node or would i just move to the next node for that line of code and then move back to where the original i pointed for the next line
student,do we have all we need to know to start project 5

student,looking at this code from lecture iterator operator nodeptr nodeptrnext return this why is this being returned as opposed to the nodeptr being returned how do we know that this points to the updated nodeptr
student,are we allowed to add extra public member functions ie adding a decrement operator for iterator
student,hi i have question about the term invalided which has been mentioned a lot by instructors answering all sort of question related to erase since we are making the erase function pass by value there is no way to really invalidate the iterator inside the erase function even if i make the nodeptr of iterator points to null it just invalidate the copy of the iterator the nodeptr in the original iterator is still pointing to that piece of memorythe erased node we just recycled wouldnt that be a issue for the iterator is still sticking with a node erased rather than points to null
student,im not sure how to fix this error but i know whats causing it basically im using this test case where i create a list 0 5 then i remove 3 from that list and now my list looks like 01245 confirmed its actually gone by printing out the contents of the list then when its about to start the new iteration of the loop i get an accessing invalid memory error i think its because in my erase function after moving the appropriate pointers around i delete the node that the current iterator is point to then the for loop uses the i to get inext but i is currently invalidated since we deleted it so when you call i its trying to access the next pointer of a deleted node not sure how to fix this because if i dont delete the node inside of erase i get a memory leak
student,so we overloaded the can we overload the operator would make testing much easier
student,i am just wondering do we just use removeall listh as the destructor
student,can someone explain what it means to exit the calculator with a 0 exit value this is not exit0 per the spec so im confused
student,can someone guide me in the correct direction for size should i create a private variable in the list class that holds the number of elements or thanks
student,effects returns a reference the top element from the stack without popping it note since a reference is returned potentially the caller can use the call to change the top without doing a poppush you should test for that in your tests how should we even test this is the caller ever going to use top to change the list and if so should we write code to safeguard against this
student,when i run the script make mytests for whatever reason im not getting the same results i have 9 test ill run the script and it will say i passed 5 out of 9 then it will say i passed 4 out of 9 however i get no failed assertion statements in the terminal i dont know whats going on
student,do we need to make a default constructor for list since it is not given to us
student,in the calccpp part im having trouble using the input i initially thought to use a char as the variable but because the input could be more than one digit if it was a number 10 100 etc that wont work so im using a string now but when i go to push the values onto the stack i need to convert the string to int which i can then convert to a rational is there any good way to convert a string to an int
student,which element do we erase inside the iterator the spec doesnt say but i assume the first element
student,im writing my countif function in stackh and the only way i can see to check every element in the stack is to use an iterator however when i try to create an iterator using for listtiterator i listbegin i listend i i get a huge compiler error is there any way to make an iterator inside of the stack class
student,hey class i just was looking over the lecture cpp files for the template container lecture the files are 19listcpp and 20listh i was looking at two functions the insertfront and insertback in the header file it is written as void listtinsertfrontconst t v but in the cpp file it is written as void listtinsertfrontint i can someone explain to me why theres a difference in the parameters between the two an explanation would be greatly appreciated
student,when running make mytests ive been getting a syntax error referencing runmytestspy it reads formatnumtestsrun numtestspassed numtestsrun numtestspassed syntaxerror invalid syntax not sure whats going on any help is appreciated
student,in the spec it says an undefined value is 00 internally it is simply represented with with numerator being 0 and denominator being 0 when printed out it should be printed out as 0 0 one 0 is in bold while the 0 is not in bold should os output be 0 or 00
student,im having trouble declaring the friendship for the ostream operator and the stack class i tried finding something in the lecture slides but all the slides only cover class friendships i tried friend stdostream operatorstdostream os const stacku obj but its having issues figuring out what u is since it wasnt declared in this scope i tried adding a template part but im not sure how to go about doing it anyone have any suggestions
student,are we allowed to temporarily make everything public for debugging purposes
student,im not exactly sure how the stringstream functions so its making it difficult to debug what is going wrong all of my rational numbers are outputted correctly in the command line but readalls always returns an empty string does anyone know whats going on s r works perfectly but for some reason s is not being updated thanks for all the help much appreciated
student,i am so confused after these operations mylist should be empty how can we do the operation such as iter and iter
student,do we need to make list test cases for the copyall and removeall functions these functions are private and so i dont see how we would be able to test them
student,i was passing the asserts in listtest00cpp but i kept getting a segmentation fault and upon inspection found that it was due to something in removefront before setting first to firstnext i was trying to set firstnextprev to 0 because its going to become the new first element after that i assigned first firstnext followed by deleting the victim node upon removing the line firstnextprev 0 i had no seg fault i guess im having a hard time understanding why this is causing a problem because if i dont change this nodes prev the it is going to be pointing to deleted memory the original first before calling removefront or could this just be an indirect consequence of something else wrong with my code
student,we have a bit of confusion with how the operator should handle the addition of 01 and 01 mathematically this is equal to 01 and when we use the algebraically equivalent formulas given it should end up being 01 but is this supposed to be written some other way our operator currently is outputing the answer at 00 and we are not sure if this is correct or not
student,just wanted to double check that class is cancelled for today
student,in the iterator class within list the starter file does not have any public keyword in which part youd put the overloaded operators constructor etc the comments say not to play with the public interface of list but to clarify we should be adding the public keyword within iterator for our implementations yes i dont see how else it could work
student,if there is only one element in the node do first and last both point to that one element or does last or firstpoint to null
student,what is the right way to declare helper member functions in rationalcpp i need my functions to have access to the private member variables of a rational object so they need to be member functions if not there will be lots of repeated code please help
student,hi where should we define the iterator functions should we define the iterator public member functions below the add your member function implementations below do not change the public interface of list although you may add the big three if needed do add the public member functions for iterator statement and what about the iterator functions that are not member functions of iterator but of list im confused about what the part in bold means
student,whenever i compile and run my tests i fail every single one of them even if i comment out all the assert statements i still fail my terminal doesnt tell me what lines im failing on either anyone else having a similar issue
student,when we call erase and after we have properly moved the pointers of the node behind and in front of the current node to be deleted how do we properly erase the node that iterator is pointing to do we call delete inodeptr because thats just deleting the pointer not the actual thing its pointing to thanks
student,has anyone else overloaded the assignment operator in iterator because i cant see why id need to
student,when i compile my listh using the make compilecheck command i get the following error listh in member function ‘int listtsize const with t int’ listcompilecheckcpp15 instantiated from here listh162 error no match for ‘operator’ in ‘i const listintthislisttend with t int’ listh103 note candidates are bool listtiteratoroperatorlisttiterator const with t int i dont understand what i mightve done wrong i almost copied and pasted from the lecture slides the line that im using the operator on is for listtiterator i begin i end i do something
student,when will the resultsautograder results for project 4 be released
student,do we have to submit test cases for iterator also since it is inside the list class
student,what is the difference between list and stack it seems like stack is the same as list except that isertfront is called push and removeback is called pop
student,for my testing i am trying a case if theres one node in the list and i want to make sure that begin and end are pointing to the same place with my iterators but this assert is failing is it because end actually points past the end and i cannot do this
student,i am looking at listcompilecheckcpp and it makes a list mylist fills it with 42s then empties it calling removefront and removeback at this point first and last both point to 0 because its an empty list then an iterator iter is created by setting iter mylistbegin mylistbegin returns 0 because mylist is empty so iter points to 0 then mylistinsertiter42 is called which inserts one element42into mylist but iter still points to 0 then mylisteraseiter gives me an error access violation reading location 0x00000004 where am i going wrong here i feel like iter should point to the first item which would be 42 but it still points to 0 i cant just set iter to the first item in the list because it is passed by value
student,lets say hypothetically that we had a stack that contained a list with datum types that are animals what would happen if we called the overloaded output operator on this stack would the animal class already be defined for what its output would be if the output operator was called on an animal element
student,will the function pointers functors that are passed to countif only take one datum argument i just want to make sure there wont be anything like the inrange functor that we saw in class today which tested to see if an integer was inbetween two integer values and therefore took two arguments thanks
student,in the effects clause for t pop it says the function may be called as popspushitem how is this possible if pop does not take any arguments though similarly for t top it says the function may be called as topspushitem but top does not take any arguments either could someone please clarify thank you
student,we implement our functions inside the h files was i actually reading it right
student,is there a good way to keep track of list size i dont think you can simply use pointer arithmetic ie lastfirst because if you insertfront you technically are inserting at an address location behind the last element arent you for example say first points to 0x1 and last points to 0x1 when you have one element if you insertfront the second node will be at the next spot 0x2 so first will now point to 0x2 and last will point to 0x1
student,node np new node firstprev np we are trying to set the previous of the true first node equal to the new node we pointed to for some reason we are getting a segmentation fault even if we try to set firstprev 0 we still get the seg fault why is this occurring is it memory we cant access
student,anyone have the web address of the site the guest announcement was from today it doesnt appear in any search results
student,does our calccpp implementation need to be able to handle invalid input for example could we be tested on a line that reads 8 sorry if i missed this in the spec
student,where should i implement iterators public member functions constructor and four overloaded operators should i implement them where they are declared that is inside the iterator class or should i declare them in the iterator class and then implement them at the bottom of listh the reason i ask is because they are all very short functions one or two lines of code and im not sure which would be more correct stylewise
student,we were provided in the project5 directory a calctest00outcorrect file but we dont seem have the input that was used to generate these were these included erroneously if possible id like to be able to test my implementation against these as right now im stuck just hoping im interpreting the specs correctly when i test calc thanks
student,when we call the eraseiterator i function does the iterator i point to null after erasing the node or does it point to the node that replaced it in the chain thanks
student,in writing stack im trying to use an element of type listtiterator but the way i thought logical to write this gives a syntax error listtiterator iterator stackh5413 error expected after expression listtiterator it listbegin whats the secret to getting this to compile
student,for some reason when the program enters the deconstructor the list that is the this isnt what it should be for example if i had a list that looked like this mylist 1 2 3 firstlast and nextprev are correct when it goes into the deconstructor the list now looks like mylist 2 firstlast and nextprev are now null oo what sorcery is going on here
student,im lost on how to write a test case for anything in the iterator class any help or advice is appreciated
student,can someone provide some insight why i may be getting this error im following the notes from the lecture
student,i really dont understand how to declare the copy constructor for lists ive looked at the slides and if i try to do what they have there it doesnt work ive tried listlisttconst listt l but it doesnt like that any help thanks
student,i understand why we set lastnext 0 in the linked list however there doesnt seem to be any instructions for setting firstprev 0 if were creating a doubly linked list shouldnt we also account for this or is there a reason for omitting the prev of first thanks
student,in the declaration in the h file for rationalh the declaration says effects returns a rational number equivalent to lhs rhs note that ab cd is algebraically equivalent to adbcbd rational operatorconst rational lhs const rational rhs this rme should instead be note that ab cd is algebraically instead of the sign
student,when im trying to implement my operator functions for the rational class my compiler yells at me and tells me bash41 make rationaltest00 g wall werror pedantic o1 rationaltest00cpp rationalcpp o rationaltest00 rationalcpp203 error ‘stdostream rationaloperatorstdostream const rational’ must take exactly one argument rationalcpp212 error ‘rational rationaloperatorconst rational const rational’ must take either zero or one argument make rationaltest00 error 1 bash41 rationalcpp203 error ‘stdostream rationaloperatorstdostream const rational’ must take exactly one argument bash syntax error near unexpected token bash41 rationalcpp212 error ‘rational rationaloperatorconst rational const rational’ must take either zero or one argument bash syntax error near unexpected token i have only tried writing the operator and the operator so these are the only two it yells at me about this makes sense because in profs slides they also the correct number of arguments but the declarations in the h file have other arguments namely stdostream operatorstdostream os const rational obj rational operatorconst rational lhs const rational rhs
student,at line 27 mylistinsertiter 42 after inserting 42 into the list do we need to modify iter in insert function if we do not need to modify iter iter will point to null at line 28 mylisteraseiter arent we causing problems or erase just do nothing if iter points to null thanks
student,
student,i was hoping to implement a small helper funtion in one of my stacktest cases to that would take a stack as input i do not wish to modify the stack passed as input so i therefore do not want to use pass by referencepointer i was curious if i will need to utilize a copy construcor or not from what i can tell all of the storage for the stack class is handled by its private member variable list the functions of stack themselves will not be creating any dynamic variables but its member functions will make calls to functions in list which will createdestroy dynamic variables as stack wont be directly managing any dynamic memory i thought it might not need a copy constructor however i became confused when i thought about how the member variable list which does allocate dynamic memory would be copied without a stack copy constructor to sum up my question if i have a copy constructor for a member variable of a class and i am not creatingdestroying dynamic variables directly within the class do i need to create a copy constructor for the class i had a pretty hard time trying to explain this so please let me know if further clarification of my question would be helpful
student,rationaltest00 uses getp and getq as member functions in rational yet they are called getnumerator and getdenominator in the given rationalh file should this be fixed
student,im a bit confused when the spec tells us not to modify the public interface does this mean that we should implement the functions outside of the class definition so then we could just implement the functions below outside of the brackets containing the class interface
student,when we wirte rational constructor we should use dynamic memory is that correct
student,in the rme for listerase and listinsert the requires clause specifies that the iterator passed as input must be a valid iterator associated with this list does this mean that we cannot pass an iterator returned by the listend function i can see where this would cause a problem in erase but it seems like a valid scenario for insert thank you
student,so we know that firstlast should point to 0 if list is empty but im confused on what to do with nextprev if there is only 1 thing inside of the list should nextprev point to 0 if there isnt a node before or after
student,1 in the lecture slides the function for iterators overloaded operator is t operator and the function for the iterators overloaded operator is iterator operator however i dont understand the reason for the return type having the addressof operator after it i implemented both of these functions without the ampersand and i am not experiencing compiler errors are they really necessary 2 in rationalh the various overloaded operator functions were all declared outside of the rational class so theyre not members of the rational class however in iterator the various overloaded operators are declared inside the iterator class so theyre treated as members of iterator in the lecture slides they are declared inside iterator as well why is it done this way is there any special reason it couldnt be an issue with nodeptr being private since ive declared list as a friend to iterator so would it be possible to declare iterators overloaded operators outside iterator and inside list and for them to still work
student,i dont understand how this works void intlistinsertfrontint i node np new node npdatum i npnext first first np the reason this is confusing to me is because were telling the nodes next pointer to point to first this works for the first case but what about when you use insert front again the new nodes next pointer will also point to first while the original nodes next pointer hasnt been changed and therefore 2 nodes now point to first
student,when it says top returns the top element in the stack what exactly does this mean does it mean the first element in the list thanks
student,will our list tests need to check for possible memory leaks in the provided code or will bugs be offbyone and specreading errors as they were in project 4 thanks
student,i love his chicken puzzles
student,lab 10 spec says that for the capacity and numelems members we should initialize them with an initializer list and then says like two lines later that labster doesnt support it does this mean that they way they already have it is correct
student,im a little uncertain on how to submit lab10 in the instruction for submitting it said to turn them in just copypaste from labster into the box on ctools or into a separate file and then attach that to your submission are we copying the codes including all of the functions and main from labster and pasting it to the submission box
student,i completed lab10 and i am ready to submit however even though i passed all tests and got the correct results when i run the code in labster there remained a deallocated memory location on the heap when i run the code i found out that at one point memory address 0x9960 is allocated for vec2 so i went to my code and added if capacity 0 delete data and it fixed the issue i essentially checked if data was already allocated once and if it was deallocated it before making a new copy however even though it passes all tests and leaves no memory leak i dont assume this was the right way to do it on the other hand the first code i wrote seemed correct it passed all tests but there was a memory leak at 0x9960 did i hit a labster bug it doesnt really make sense did anyone else have same issue thanks
student,when i uncomment testall and run all the tests most of my output is correct except for a few parts im assuming this difference means something is wrong with my code but i cant seem to figure out why the error occurs i dont know what could be causing that 0 to appear heres a screenshot of the incorrect output
student,if we used deck in our player tests does that mean we will receive no credit for our player tests we only used the deal function of deck to quickly generate cards to test with we were unaware that we werent supposed to use deckh and the autograder compiled the tests with deckh successfully
student,i was looking back through piazza and i noticed it said that apparently we werent supposed to include deckh in our player tests which i think i confirmed in the spec its not 100 clear to me we did include deckh in our player tests and submitted because we didnt realize this was a rule are we going to fail all of our player tests because of this
student,blue review loses the sound trackhope someone fix it
student,how do we know if our solution is correct i assume if we do skip to end and there are no errors then we did it correctly
student,canhas the post lab survey be sent out
student,just a check the lab 10 assignment says to submit intvectorlab10cpp but the file in red in the spec says name it lab10intvectorcpp does it matter which file name
student,this question is kinda late but is it ok for us to make a custom deck class that has public member variables to cast to for a cheating player
student,tried to submit a correction just now and autograder didnt accept it
student,do we still add 1 to the number of hands if we get a push or do we keep the hand the same
student,when i run my blackjackcpp file it seg faults instanteously even when i put cout hehsdfh endl as the first line in the main function
student,what happens if you initially start the argument of bankroll less than the minimum should the stdout print out this at the end player has 2 after 0 hands
student,i thought the following method of creating a cstring worked fine and was said to be correct but now im getting problems with it const char c string im getting an error about a deprecated conversion from string constant to char i thought string was of the type const char but now its not
student,are we allowed to include deckh in our player test files
student,so do we have to test draw for different suits such as draw works correctly on a soft 18 and a 7 of spades but not a soft 18 and a 7 of clubs or are we not expected for errors dealing with suit in draw
student,hello i checked my blackjack output to the correct output and there is absolutely no difference between the two yet when i submit everything to the autograder i get back that the blackjack test case didnt pass i used diff kompare and a few other commands still says there is a difference does anyone else have this problem thanks
student,i am having trouble with the autograder everything with my program runs correctly from the terminal but when i submit it to the autograder i get compilation errors on my blackjacktest00 and player tests ive tried everything i can to fix it including removing unused libraries from my files double checking for unused variables and redownloading all the h files in case they got changed while i was working on my project nothing seems to be working any help would be greatly appreciated
student,for the basic blackjack test output discard all is only working for the first two hands then for the third one its keeping players hand value from the second hand ive been debugging this thing for an hr any help is much appreciated
student,i keep getting an error in playerfactory that says error expected initializer before ‘simpleplayer’ error ‘simpleplayer’ was not declared in this scope i have simpleplayer declared as static simple simpleplayer this is in my code after my classes but before the playerfactory does anyone know what im doing wrong
student,hi i get a seg fault if i input anything with hands 8 eg blackjack 100 8 counting however the segmentation fault always happens at the end of my code eg player has 87 after 90 hands segmentation fault so it seems like it runs through everything but somehow goes off of memory at the end i return 0 at the end and everything and if i use gdb my program always exits with code01 which im assuming is exit1 which is in the factory function for playercpp but im definitely putting in counting as an input thanks
student,lets say i want to test an extreme case for deal so i have my test case deal 60 cards which of course isnt possible how can i write in whether or not the main returns 0 shouldnt the invalid input crash the program
student,are we suppose to make sure that the entered inputs for hands bankroll will be integers or we have to ask user again if heshe enters double if heshe also makes a mistake of typing error for simple counting or competitor do we exit the program or ask user to reenter the inputs
student,should our words be in comments or noncomments
student,so i include randh but im getting an error message about the function being undefined the issue is with the makefile compilation it doesnt compile randh i had manually tried this i typed g wall werror pedantic o1 decktest03cpp deckcpp cardcpp randcpp o deck3 which actually worked fine so id like to know if this feature can be added to the final grader i just thought itd be neat if i can generate a random number to test instead of coming up with a fixed number
student,when counting how many lines of code make up a function i know it is common practice to not include lines that are just whitespace but what about lines that have a single curly brace on them what standards are we using for this class thank you in advance
student,in my player tests i included asserts for the players hand implementation for my own testing purposes would it be okay to keep this for the player tests and assume that the hand implementation would be correct
student,if the player doesnt not get dealt a natural 21 but later gets dealt a 21 and then the same thing happens to the dealer is that still considered a push
student,ive finished playercpp and it compiles correctly but when i test it the shuffled and expose do nothing while the bet return correctly how can i fix that
student,the autograder appears to be down right now please help thanks
student,when i use valgrind for blackjack the error summary is 1 errors from 1 contexts suppressed 6 form 6 and it states there is an invalid read of size 1 does anyone know what causes this problem
student,i want to condense my tests in like 6 files however i am not using procedures to split up my tests is it ok if test files ignore the 50 lines per function and keep everything in main or would i be forced to split everything up
student,i know from the specs that we stdout what cards are being dealt to the player for the first 2 cards but do we also stdout what he draws after the first 2 also
student,i heard we are not supposed to add certain h files in certain cpp files in project 4 i heard professor de orio talk about this during the beginning of lecture but i did not clearly understand why if we really do not add certain header files in certain cpp files which ones exactly do we do that to
student,is the minimum always going to be 5
student,yknowfor a competitive player strategy
student,are we required to test player factory for our countinf player tests
student,does the counting player use the same draw strategy as simple player i just want to make sure
student,does lab 10 have a postlab survey if so when will it be available
student,when will the specs for project 5 be released
student,when i try to run make mytests not all of the test cases are showing up but it says it ran them all also if i add cout statements inside of a test case they dont show up either im really confused
student,do we need rmes for counting simple and competitive
student,when i try to compile my files together i get pages of errors saying undefined reference any time i call any member function of any class in my blackjackcpp i am including all h files in blackjackcpp and am typing the command line exactly as given with all files included yet it seems to think either there are no h files or they are linked to nothing
student,when i debugging my playertest and want to do player player playerfactorsimple cout playerbet10 4 endl it says that debug error pure virtual function call how can i correct it
student,in the spec it states be sure to expose any faceup cards to the player for the initial deal does this mean expose all faceup cards dealt including the one to the dealer or expose just the faceup cards dealt to the player thanks
student,so ive read through the piazza posts and i still dont know if ive implemented my getrank function properly all i do is return rank i account for the fact that the number this produces is 2 less than the rank later in the files by adding 2 to the values however i do compare cards by using getrank cardtwo for example is this incorrect i dont want to change this because then im worried if i dont simple return rank i wont be able to compare cards in the getrank cardtwo way i just dont know if this would properly pass the instructors test cases
student,can we assume that the h files will be correct when testing for instance all the function names and inputoutput types will be valid only the implementations will be incorrect
student,since were testing bet based on expose testing expose based on bet and testing shuffled based on expose and bet does that mean that if bet is buggy all these tests including expose and shuffled would fail or is it considered false negatives
student,in the spec for the rules of an ace if any being hard it says if the players hand totals 11 or less he always hits is this scenario of the hand total is less than 11 with a hard ace ever even possible for example for the ace card to be more advantageous for the either player it would be assigned 11 soft off the bat if total hand count is still under 21 for any situation when total hand count goes over 21 and ace is still 11soft then ace would turn to hard 1 22 is the lowest number to bust thus 22 11 11 means the other nonace cards add up to 11 and we cannot change these values thus soft ace changed to hard ace would lead to 22111 12 another example if two aces are the first two dealt cards to the player then total hand count would be 12 to be more advantageous to the player thus hand count less than 11 will a hard count could not apply here i just cant think of an example where this specification would be true and i am not sure how to go about it for writing a test case
student,i wanted to change my betting function for certain values of count i read other posts about getcount which doesnt work since you are using a player but getcount is not declared in playerh how should i obtain count in my derived class competitor would i have to make competitor be a derived class of simple and copy paste the expose and shuffled code
student,if both the player and dealer are dealt a natural 21 wouldnt we never know about the dealer since we just proceed with the next hand once we know the player has a natural 21
student,i was wondering if we had to test the draw function separately for simple player counting player and competitor they all do the same thing right so if i test one it should test the others also will we be graded on test cases for competitorare we supposed to test competitor
student,when running our test files are we credited with catching a bug if only one of the test files returns with an error
student,this is the error i get does anybody know what im doing wrong bash41 g wall werror pedantic o1 cardcpp randcpp handcpp deckcpp playercpp blackjackcpp o blackjack usrlibgccx8664redhatlinux447lib64crt1o in function start text0x20 undefined reference to main collect2 ld returned 1 exit status bash41
student,in the spec it says that the simple player will always bet the minimum the counting player also always bets the minimum if count 2 it doesnt mention anything about the case where the minimum is higher than the bankroll until the driver program section so when testing playercpp if the minimum is higher than the bankroll will the bet function still return the minimum or does it not matter
student,has anyone else tried looking for a difference in output between counting and simples bets i know that counting is supposed to changed his betting strategy if his count gets to 2 but i made them play 10 hands and im couting the count at every expose call and the count literally never gets to 2 in fact it ends up in the negatives for a majority of the time i have it reset every time the deck is shuffled which is rarely and i know im addingsubtracting the count at the right times because im following the count line by line using cout is this supposed to be happening
student,should helper functions in blackjack be declared static
student,if we add to any of the subclasses of player extra functions that are not included in the abstraction do they have to be static
student,can we assume that the c strings sent to player factory will be either simple counting or competitor and nothing else
student,this is just for clarification if the bankroll value at the command line is less than the required minimum then the driver should shuffle the deck then exit with player has after 0 hands is this correct
student,when i run blackjack 100 3 simple the totals and bets all come out the same the only thing that is different is the cards are the cards supposed to be the same also for instance mine says player dealt king of clubs but the blackjacktest00outcorrect says player dealt king of spades

student,confused as to how our test cases should work i was originally going to make separate files to test for separate functions for each adt ie several files testing bet several testing draw several testing expose but the spec seems to state that our tests will be used to determine whether the entire adt implementation theyre tested against is correct or not does this mean that each file has to test all parts of each adt all functions in order to find a bug anywhere in the implementation
student,so what if we test shuffle for 10 numbers but one of the deckcpp says like if n 30 do something bad but we dont test that specific number basically what i am trying to ask is should we literally test every combination
student,is there any reason my partner and i cant create a new hand every different round in blackjack rather than call discard all i know it may not be the best form but its working for me and i cant think of a scenario where it wouldnt thank you
student,so lets say i split my tests into multiple files and i use assert commands dhould i also use a return 0 at the end of my test in main since in the specs it says to return 0 if true or is just using the assert commands fine i guess i dont exactly understand the format for the tests
student,playerh includes cardh and handh shouldnt it only need to include handh since handh includes cardh it doesnt really matter since all of the provided h files have include guard however isnt it still better from a style standpoint to only include if necessary
student,will we be penalized if we submit the tests that we wrote for the simple player and competitor i included them originally and dont want to spend the time deleting and resubmitting if i can avoid it thank you
student,is there a limit to the maximum amount the competitor can bet or can he bet any amount as long as it bankroll
student,for some reason im getting a segfault if i enter a handvalue 10 in the command lineanyone have any ideas
student,are we allowed to let our competitor player use the same exact counting strategy as the counting player but let it behave differently in bet
student,i still dont completely understand the issues of using header files in the files of our tests arent some of them necessary and if not what is the method behind testing without using them any advice would be appreciated thank you
student,if a players bankroll is 200 and heshe bets 5 and is dealt a natural 21 is their final bankroll 202 or 207
student,if were dealing with a fcn that returns a bool and we have an if else statement with the condition being a bool isnt the else statement not needed couldnt we just write the if statement then follow it up with the else part without the else since the only other possible outcome is the opposite bool i ask this since id like to avoid a compiler error that says i have a void for a non void fcn
student,i tried running the blackjack 100 3 simple blackjackout command but when i do it doesnt do anything and bash41 does not show up again does that mean i have an infinite loop
student,so i included a shufflebool private member in my counting class for the function shuffled to assign true whenever the deck gets shuffled to reset the count while this worked on xcode for some reason im not able to compile it on linux i get the following error code playercpp145 error iso c forbids initialization of member ‘shufflebool’ playercpp145 error making ‘shufflebool’ static playercpp145 error iso c forbids inclass initialization of nonconst static member ‘shufflebool’ has anyone dealt with a similar issue and found a workaround for this
student,just to clarify the logic for determining whether or not an ace should be counted as an 11 or a 1 is in the addcard function of hand
student,does our int main have to be under 50 lines of code cuz if it isle sigh
student,if the player busts are we supposed to announce it like this players total is 22 player busts hand 3 bankroll 97 do we announce player total before or after player busts
student,what kind of files are these supposed to be i understand what goes in to them but what type of file are they txt the spec doesnt say
student,when i run the tar czvf in terminal for playertestoverview and decktestoverview it says cannot stat no such file or directory should i have those files or is there a way i can get it to add all my test files without getting this error thanks
student,when it says one of my test case files failed to compile that just means by test case was poorly written and set up bad it doesnt necessarily mean that something in the deckcpp file in this case is wrong right
student,i am having a hard time understanding exactly what is supposed to occur in expose in the playercpp any help is greatly appreciated thanks in advance
student,hi all i finished the project but i still dont understand something that should be very obvious where in the project did we create the relationship between player and hand for example we can use playerhandvalue but it doesnt seem like we ever explicitly say that each player has a designated hand sorry that this is such a stupid question
student,is there any specification for after player hits because its part of his strategy to reannounce the total in players hand ie output player bets 5 player dealt eight of hearts dealer dealt five of diamonds player dealt three of spades players total is 11 player dealt two of diamonds players total is 13 dealers hole card is ten of spades or is it suppose to be like the following output player bets 5 player dealt eight of hearts dealer dealt five of diamonds player dealt three of spades players total is 11 player dealt two of diamonds dealers hole card is ten of spades
student,what could the difference be
student,if the player has one ace counted as 1 and one ace counted as 11 which the total is 12 is it counted as hard or soft
student,i am confused why for playercpp draw const hand player why do we need const and
student,when compiling playercpp i get an error that says global constructors keyed to xxxx where xxxx is a jumble of characters followed by another error undefined reference to vtable for competitor ive double checked that im returning player from playerfactoryconst char s and that the each player is globally declared ie static simple simpleplayer static counting countingplayer static competitor competitorplayer anyone else had this and fixed it or has any idea what might be causing it
student,we cannot compare the instance of the same class can we but we can compare the pointeradress of these instances of the same class for the above statements someonebetter be gsi help me
student,in the spec it mentions that class implementations must be static and const except for the three players what does this mean
student,when writing our player tests can we assume that the players will inherit needed functions correctly for example since the counting player draw strategy is the same as the simple player can we just test the draw function for a simple player and assume that the counting player will draw the same way or do we need to test that draw strategies for counting and simple are actually the same
student,i am trying to declare an instance of my simpleplayer in my test files as such simpleplayer player however the compiler keeps saying that simpleplayer is undefined i included playerh any ideas on what im doing wrong
student,bash41 g pedantic wall werror o1 o blackjackcpp deckcpp handcpp playercpp randcpp cardcpp usrlibgccx8664redhatlinux447lib64crt1o in function start text0x20 undefined reference to main collect2 ld returned 1 exit status when i tried to build the program in linux i got the above error saying undefined reference to main but all my files compiled individually using c command im not sure what this means any information
student,in the spec it states since each of your implementation cpp files will be graded separately by compiling it with our solution code do not write code that contains interfile dependencies such that one of your files depends on another one of your files for example do not write an extern function in handcpp that you use in playercpp this slipped my mind and in my deckcpp i have the following code segment int suit cardspades is this considered unacceptable because its referencing something from cardcpp i use the card scope resolution in my handcpp as well
student,how do i use the pointer returned by playerfactory when i am calling player functions in blackjackcpp in other words i have been using this syntax to call member functions in blackjackcpp ddeckshufflecut i am not sure what d would be if i am calling a player member function and i can only receive a pointer from playerfactory simply using the pointer as d has been giving me errors
student,when i run make tar bash41 make tar make no rule to make target decktestoverview needed by tar stop i get this errordo you guys know why this is the case
student,say for example our player has 18 total and the dealer has three aces and a 4 most players would count it as a seven and hit again but our dealer stays because he already counted it as soft and has 17 is this correct does he just lose thanks
student,can we have one test file be over 400 lines lol
student,in our playercpp do we first declare our classes and then below all that do the implementations or can we simply do that all at once in other words simplified example do we write it like class simple public player public int betunsigned int bankroll unsigned int minimum counting and competitor int simplebetunsigned int bankroll unsigned int minimum implementation or can we just write class simple public player public int betunsigned int bankroll unsigned int minimum implementation counting and competitor additionally if a function definition doesnt change across players do we need to reimplement the functions with the same code or can we just omit them
student,as above
student,so im reading the specs and i just want to be double sure lets just say if we typed in hand 0 into the command line the specs on the third page said the driver first shuffles the deck the specs continue to say then while the players bankroll is greater than or equal to minimum bet of 5 and there are hands left to be played obviously there are no hands to play if the hand 0 however my question is does the deck still shuffle even if hand 0
student,in the projecte description there is no specified strategy for drawing cards for the counting player does this mean that she should follow the same strategy as the simple player
student,are we required to write helper functions in our blackjack driver will we be docked points if we dont
student,why the following does not work card cstaticcastcardrank1 staticcastcardsuit2 which gives a error what can i do if i want to initialize thing with enums by numbles
student,i have three questions regarding the dealer 1 if the dealer gets a natural 21 do we have to print out dealer dealt natural 21n 2 if the dealer gets a natural 21 does the player lose 32 of hisher wager or just his wager 3 if the dealers dealt hand is already over 17 but is not a natural 21 so he does not hit at all is his hole card exposed thanks
student,in other words how long until the autograder or person grader gets sick of letting the test cases cuts it off and says its a failure i ask as my player test just for counting takes about 13210000000 13410000000 computations basically im testing every darn possibility on multiple levels in other words for every possible exposing set of cards of size n which has 13n possibilities do either one set of 10000000 or another 10000000 tests based off of the players count oh and plus another set of tests for something else too much fun with for loops at the moment i have a bug and just letting it cout a little bit of information for every test 3 couts as i have some sort of error either in playercpp or in my tests this is taking far too long just for couting so a better question would be what would be reasonable im not sure how crazy the bugs would be including exposing the player a hundred cards and on the 101th theres a bug to reset the count to 0 what are the limits to the insane possibilities of bugs the given playercpps will have a reasonable student as the bugs seem to be based off of that could do anything and apparently doing stressboundary tests at the same time is a really bad decision help oh 281 will be such hellish fun
student,when you use the function getrank it returns a value that is not truly representative of the cards actual rank for example if you call get rank of a two it returns 0 because of enum layout of the array of card ranks should we be creating a helper function that returns cards actual rank by calling getrank and adding 2 in other words will we get points of if we say if cgetrank 0 when were really checking if the cards rank equals 2 is 0 in this case considered an unexplained or magic number
student,
student,will points be deducted if one of our test case descriptions have 4 sentences instead of 3 are run on sentences ok
student,i have nevered used reset function in my drivers programwhat is it used for
student,are we allowed to diff outputs with our fellow classmates for certain command lines no sharing of testcases or actual code is used to diff outputs
student,currently besides the allowed built in system libraries we are including deckh playerh handh and randh can we include all of these
student,in one of my handtests i am using asserts to check whether or not the hand is soft or hard ex hand h asserthhandissoft asserthhandissoft but i am getting this compile error for the lines with the asserts void value not ignored as it ought to be any idea what this means
student,i cant call getcount because playerfactory returns a pointer to a player but getcount is only a member function in the derived classes of player how can i call it
student,in my blackjackcpp i keep running into seg faults when i do playershuffled playerexposec ect is this because player factory returns a pointer to a player so this declaration isnt specific enough
student,do we get graded on the style of our test cases do we need to make comments in our test cases if the overview already describes what each test does
student,what is the difference between declaring member variables at the start of a class definition before you type public vs declaring them as private member variables at the end are the former counted as private or public member variables
student,what is the minimum number of hands that can be played or in other words what is the least allowable number that can b e used as an input so would this be 1 or 0 no negative numbers
student,what should happen if the deck is empty and we call deal
student,i know we dont expose it but do we out the dealers down card
student,do we make generic definitions for the functions in player then decide when to call them based on the specs of the different players or do we write separate functions for each of the three players and in these functions decide when to hit or stay
student,so just to be sure we should only print the playerdealer hand values once per hand as in we dont print the hand value until the player stops asking for cards or busts and same for the dealer also when shuffling do we print after or before the hand line prints ie hand 3 bankroll 100 shuffling or shuffling hand 3 bankroll 100
student,say you have an ace counted as an 11 can it change to be counted as a 1 as you add more cards to the hand or once you count it as 11 it is indefinitely counted as 11
student,so i have deduced that i have a memory error somewhere in my shuffle function that is causing unrelated variables to change values unexpectedly is there a way that i could use valgrind to find out where i am accessing an invalid address i think i am accessing memory outside of the arrays in my shuffle function
student,i seem to find discrepancies about if we should implement getterssetters in this project my competitor inherits from counting but since count is a private member variable i found myself duplicating code to instantiate it declaring it private again and setting it to 0 in the constructor is this alright or should i be writing a gettersetter function to access this either way it seems like i need to have some extra code to set it equal to 0 at the construction of my competitor player thanks
student,two questions how can we keep track of the value of variable like we do in microsoft visual studio or xcode how can we debug the code line by line
student,i cant compile my test because i get this error im using the make handtest00cpp command in the terminal and i am including handh in my test file
student,im confused as to how to implement the functions in handcpp without a private array of the cards in the hand any help on where to start would be appreciated
student,if the dealer is dealt a natural 21 should we announce as we do the players
student,in the style guidelines file it says if a function is longer then 50 lines we should make it shorter by breaking it up does this apply to the main function in our driver
student,the spec says the dealer hits until he reaches 17 or busts does this mean that if he gets to 18 then he must stand
student,
student,just to be clear the whole concept of face up or face down and the function expose only have to do with the counting behavior of counting player and nothing else
student,how many deck test cases should we have i know there isnt really a concrete answer to this however there are only four member functions in the deck class and isnt much variety to with what you can test unlike the player test cases with the three derived classes i am finding these quite repetitive and tedious as i have written seven so far and im running out of ideas with what to test should each test case be a unique scenario how many test cases can one write with only four member functions to work with thanks
student,can we get one more correct output for blackjack about counting
student,do we need to do some error checks for the 3 input command like for last project there is no spec covering this issue
student,for my declaration of the three players at the end of playercpp i am receiving an error playercpp153 error expected initializer before ‘simpleplayer’ playercpp in function ‘player playerfactoryconst char’ playercpp164 error ‘simpleplayer’ was not declared in this scope i declare the three players just like this static simple simpleplayer static counting countingplayer static competitor competitorplayer so im not sure why im receiving this error for simple player and neither of the other two it probably has something to do with the fact that simple is a subclass of player and the other two are subclasses of simple but i still cant figure out what im doing wrong
student,is there some sort of roundabout way to change the hand value and soft value of a hand without actually adding cards to the hand my intuition tells me no since theyre the cards private member variables but i was wondering if anyones found a way to do this would make my test cases simpler
student,from the spec describing driver then while the players bankroll is greater than or equal to minimum bet of 5 and there are hands left to be played sorry what exactly does minimum bet of 5 mean the only explanation i can come up with is if its 5 more than the minimum bet but i doubt thats what it is
student,terminal is returning the following error playercpp119 error expected initializer before ‘’ token at my declaration of the playerfactory player playerfactoryconst char s but i just copied it from the h file am i missing something
student,just to confirm the strategy for whether or not the player wants to hitstand is the same for simple and counting player right the only difference between them is that the counting player makes a more educated wager
student,i made counting and competitive subclasses of simple and declareddefined the draw function in simple if i have a pointer to a counting or competitive player and want to call the draw function i can simply call countingpointerdraw or competitivepointerdraw and it will automatically use simples draw function even though i have not declared draw at all in the two subclasses correct
student,in the last line of code when the spec says to do this finally when the player either has too little money to make a minimum wager or the allotted hands have been played announce the outcome are we supposed to output the hands parameter entered in in the command line or the amount of hands it took for the player to lose thanks
student,when the deck reaches 20 cards or less and needs to be reshuffled should our program print the shuffle and cut information before or after the information about the next hand is printed that is which of the following should print hand 5 bankroll 10 shuffling the deck cut at 28 etc shuffling the deck cut at 28 other cut at lines hand 5 bankroll 10
student,after writing the derived class singleplayer im getting this error when trying to declare an instance of it unknown type name singleplayer does anyone know what could be causing this problem thanks
student,our count private variables are defined in counting and competitor players for testing we are trying to implement a getter function that returns the count when we do implement a getter function within the derived classes it is giving us this error class player has no member named getcount are we also supposed include the getter function in simple player it gives us the same error
student,regarding the note in the rme for shuffle do we need to ensure that previously dealt cards are returned to the deck or do we assume this to be a requirement
student,im testing my counting player and getting the error counterplayerbet12u 5u cannot be used as a function i made sure i didnt have a variable named bet so thats not the issue anyone know what could cause this is it trying to use the pure virtual version of bet from the interface
student,the spec says in this case the player gets 32 wager does that mean you also say player wins spec doesnt specify
student,for the member variables we create for our derived classes in playercpp are they supposed to be protected or private
student,are we allowed more than 10 test files for player
student,so just checking if a player is dealt a 4 and a 7 then hits and receives a 10 this is not a natural 21 with this unnatural 21 i still need to check the dealers hand in case the dealer also gets a 21 for in that case its a push right
student,im just testing out my handcpp and if you have a case of adding ace king king which will result to 21 already but if you were to add another card this wont happen in the actual game i know say two then would the result give 23 or 13
student,what if the count is not greater than 2 but his bankroll is less than minimum assumption he should bet minimum
student,i thought our original way of shuffling would work but it only works for the cut 26 case what we were doing at first was splitting the deck into 2 parts n and 52 n then combining those 2 decks to create the new shuffled deck but doesnt seem to be working any help
student,the player does not get natural 21 or he gets a 21 but isnot naturalwill the money wager return for dealer is 32
student,do we have to copypaste the rmes for functions in the h files into the cpp files
student,will he get 7 or 8 or 75 i am wondering
student,so im attempting to run the command make mytests the command works for my deck tests however when it reaches my player tests it says no rule to make target playertest00exe needed by playertests stop my tests are of the format playertest00cpp playertest01cpp etc any ideas on whats wrong
student,i wrote the tests for player such as playertest00cpp etc but how do i run them when i try playertest00 it says no such file or directory
student,i am having trouble getting my factory function to compile starting with the simple derived class i have so far attempted to copy the triangle adt factory func from lecture static simple gsimple player playerfactoryconst char s ifstrcmpssimple 0 return gsimple xcode is telling me that the issue is when i return gsimple giving me the following error message cannot initialize return object of type player with an rvalue of type simple since simple is a derived class of player im not sure why this is an issue help
student,since counting player follows the same strategy as simple player for the draw function is it necessary to test draw for counting player you dont need to write any new code for draw for counting player so testing this function for counting player would be literally the same test cases with the player pointer pointing to counting player instead
student,after running make tar in the caen environment and submitting to the autograder it came back with all of my written test cases failing the autograder each of our test files has its own main function in it does this all files must compile from within the same directory from the spec mean that this is not allowed do we need to somehow write all of our test files with just one main function
student,i am confused about how are we supposed to test countingplayer do we just test each individual function in countingplayer or do we simulate a whole entire game with countingplayer and see if it behaves correctly
student,for instance if players name is not counting simple and competitor do we neede to use asset to abort the project
student,i have a seg fault when i set the next pointer to cards0 the first card in the pack i set it by writing next cards0 is there something wrong with this code this is where it says i am receiving the seg fault when i use gdb
student,i understand that we should test shuffled and exposed in our player adt through bet or a debugger my question is what can do for a test file that we turn in that checks these behaviors
student,if i wanted to run my program through a debugger like gdb what would be the command line argument so say i do blackjack 100 3 simple what would i do different to include the debugger
student,i submitted my project 4 to the autograder and it says that none of my student tests are compiling ive compiled all of these tests in the caen linux environment over vnc without any problems here is my autograder report running test cases running test cardtest00 pass running test decktest00 pass running test blackjacktest00 pass you passed 3 out of 3 test cases measuring 33 compiling student test cases student test case decktest03cpp failed to compile student test case decktest00cpp failed to compile student test case decktest02cpp failed to compile student test case decktest01cpp failed to compile student test case playertest00cpp failed to compile student test case playertest01cpp failed to compile has anyone seen this type of problem before im having a difficult time figuring out why this is occurring thanks
student,so i have a for loop that keeps playing hands as long as the bankroll is greater than the minimum and as long as the number of hands that are supposed to be played havent been played yet however for some reason it only conducts the first hand of the game and doesnt go beyond that what could be going wrongmy partner and i thinking that maybe the hand instances and the player instance need to be reset back to defaultbut even after doing this it doesnt work
student,the assignment doesnt say we cant use them i was thinking about using them for holding the cards dealt
student,i have a couple questions when i am testing do it do make card or g pedantic im assuming the second one but when i do cardtest00 it said the file is not in the directory even though its all in the same place i have checked spelling many times any ideas why this could be happening
student,what happens if push occurs how does the bankroll change does it just announce push and then proceed to the next hand or something else thanks
student,how does the simple player determine how much heshe wants to wager
student,you must also declare a static global instance of each of the three players in playercpp finally in playercpp you should implement the following factory function that returns a pointer to one of these three global instances could someone please explain to me what this meansthanks
student,i have a clarification question on reset does it unshuffle the deck if its been shuffled or does it just reset the pointer
student,can i write all my plaeyer test cases in one cpp file
student,since the amount the player bets depends on whether the player is a simple counting or competitor how are we supposed to know which type of player is currently playing are we supposed to call the playerfactory function
student,we are confused on how to handle the aces all the spec says is an ace is worth either 1 or 11whichever is more advantageous to the player we are struggling on determining which is more advantageous also can the value of the ace change once you set it for example if you are dealt an ace and a 6 and make the ace soft for a value of 17 then you hit to get a 5 can you change the ace to hard to prevent the value from busting
student,
student,is a hand considered soft or hard when a player receives two aces with one being used as a value of 11 and the other being used as a value of 1
student,for betting what happens if the minimum wager happens to be larger than the players bankroll does he lose or should we account for this in the function
student,how do we fill in the remainder of the deck with the cards remaining in the other side say i gut at 48 so that there are 4 cards on the right and 52 on the left so after i run out of the right side and have used 3 cards from the left what do i do with the remaining 45 from my left side of the deck does the top card of my 45 card left deck become the top card in my shuffle deck which is the 7 card deck or do i just simply place the 45 cards on top of the shuffle deck so the top card of my 45 deck is after the shuffle the first card to be dealt hope that made sense thanks
student,player has 20 points and dealer has 15 dealer hits and now has 17 points from another post i believe the answer was that the dealer should hit if that is the case lets say the dealer now has 20 points matching the player points should the dealer still hit
student,in these functions are we literally just supposed to return value and soft or are we supposed to compute the value of value and compute the value of soft and then return them
student,im just so confused about simple player bet and i keep rereading the spec and the h rme but im still so confused so do we actually ask the user for their wager bet in the simple players bet function as in the spec notes that we have to ask the player for a wager and announce it the announcing is done in the driver function im guessing but where d owe ask the player for a wager wheres the cin function is that placed in the bet function i guess im just confused by bet
student,are face down cards added to the dealers hand or not like the face down card that the dealer gets dealt…what do we do that just save it for later
student,so cards of only the dealer are exposed current and any cards dealt to the player are just added to the hand
student,i donot understand the difference even after spec segfault
student,so this is kind of a dumb question but in the driver do we have to create both a driver and a player if not then who is the dealer thanks
student,bash41 blackjack 100 3 simple shuffling the deck cut at 39 cut at 22 cut at 33 cut at 37 cut at 38 cut at 37 cut at 38 hand 1 bankroll 100 player bets 5 player dealt two of spades dealer dealt three of spades player dealt four of spades players total is 19 dealers hole card is five of spadesdealer busts hand 2 bankroll 105 player bets 5 player dealt ten of spades dealer dealt jack of spades player dealt queen of spades players total is 20 dealers hole card is king of spadesdealer busts hand 3 bankroll 110 player bets 5 player dealt ace of spades dealer dealt two of hearts player dealt three of hearts players total is 19 dealers hole card is four of heartsdealer busts player has 115 after 3 hands that is my answer for driver program how to use gdb debug these lines i used mircosoft visual studio before i am not familiar with gdb some command lines general ideas
student,shuffling the deck cut at 39 cut at 22 cut at 33 cut at 37 cut at 38 cut at 37 cut at 38 hand 2 bankroll 100 player bets 5 player dealt two of spadesdealer dealt three of spadesplayer dealt four of spadesplayers total is 19 dealers hole card is five of spadesdealer busts hand 3 bankroll 105 player bets 5 player dealt ten of spadesdealer dealt jack of spadesplayer dealt queen of spadesplayers total is 20 dealers hole card is king of spadesdealer busts hand 4 bankroll 110 player bets 5 player dealt ace of spadesdealer dealt two of heartsplayer dealt three of heartsplayers total is 19 dealers hole card is four of heartsdealer busts player has 115 after 3 hands
student,the spec says that the dealer hits until either reaching 17 or busting however i wanted to clarify this behavior when the player has between 17 and 21 lets say the player has 20 points and the dealer has 14 points the dealer then hits and gets a four card he now has 18 which is above 17 however heshe would still need more points to win the hand so would they still hit in this instance or hold just because the hand is worth at least 17
student,in our reset we initially tried to use deck but found it didnt work can the constructor be used in member functions of the class when using a constructor does it create a new object instead of changing an existing one preventing it from being used
student,what exactly do we include in the overview files i have all my tests cases written in one file and it works but i want to split them up to reduce risk do we say something like this playertest00cpp checks bet in such a manner playertest01cpp checks draw to make it picks some case right
student,we never used the function reset in our code we were wondering if this is a problem since we wrote it in deckcpp there was never a time in the driver function where we wanted the deck to revert to a newly opened deck should there be
student,so my competitor class inherits from counting how would i have competitor inherit a private member variable from counting
student,can i include deckh in my player tests
student,i know the what error means for my factory function since it is a warnning how can i fix it
student,my partner and i are stumped we are writing a test case for deck and when we try to compile it we receive a strange error message and we dont know how to fix it this is what happens when we try to compile it g decktest02cpp deckcpp cardcpp o decktest02 usrlibgccx8664redhatlinux447includec447iostream in function ‘int main’ usrlibgccx8664redhatlinux447includec447iostream110 error invalid use of void expression line 110 is assertshadowcardgetrank cardtwo we are confident that our syntax is correct so we just cant figure out why it wont compile any help would be appreciated

student,is counting a derived class of simpler
student,so when running my player tests i keep getting a seg fault after calling the bet function ive been going at it for a while now and really have no idea what the problem might be the code in question card cstaticcastcardrank10 staticcastcardsuit2 player player playerfactorysimple hand hand int correctb 23 actualb bool correctd true actuald actualb player bet500 23
student,in my test files i am trying to compare cards to determine if deckshuffle is working properly but am receiving an error that seems to say the operator is not valid for cards my question is this do i need to overload the operator or just use cardgetrank and cardgetsuit for each comparison or is there another way around this thanks
student,what are we meant to initialize this to
student,can someone explain what this function supposed to do i am confused by its rme so first what does the parameter card dealer do in this function which card is the dealers up card also is this function deciding whether the player hit or stand
student,im soo confused as to whats going on please help i called bet on my player and saved the value the player bets into a variable and then asserted that the player indeed bet double the minimum since the count should be twowhich i checked and it was…however i found out using cout statements that its not even going into the bet function and i have no idea why any ideas am i not calling it right or something…for example its fine to do like int bet cbet1005 right thanks
student,how do we modify or even check a players bankroll inside of the driver if we cant access any getter functions inside of the players subclasses
student,how can you make cardsremaining notice the difference between no cards dealts and all 52 cards dealt is it possible this would lead me to believe that there can only be one unique value for both of these cases either 52 or 0
student,i know there was a question on this before about how its not possible to use a getting funciton to get the count in playercounting however is there any other way we can test whether our bet function for playercounting works thanks
student,how are we supposed to test our player functions if the hand and the player dont correlate with each other
student,are we allowed to overload functions in the derived player classes we wanted to add a count variable to the counting player class for the bet function is this allowed or will the autograder not recognize this
student,if neither the player nor the dealer busts and we have to compare the output do we print out dealer wins or player wins depending on who has the higher value and if they are equal we print out push or do we print out that both of them win specs a little unclear i guess it makes sense that we print out whoever has the highest value
student,class simple public player public int betunsigned int bankroll unsigned int minimum return minimum is this the right way to declare function mentioned in class player if not could somebody direct me to source where i can look it up thank you
student,do we have to consider incorrect input by the user in the driver program for example if there arent the correct number of arguments or the input bankroll is negative do we have to check for these in blackjackcpp and what error messages should we return
student,asked this yesterday and didnt really get an answer that made sense so ill try again i made my counting class a subclass of simple so i could just call simples draw function from within counting for countings draw function however upon compiling it says no matching function for the call could this be a syntax issue i just put return simpledraw arguments for countings draw function is this the wrong way to do this
student,does our cardsremaining function have to return 0 if there are no cards remaining or do we not have to deal with this case
student,do we need rmes and comments for our cpp files other than blackjack
student,i wrote and tested my playercpp code and went back to fix the factory function but in xcode i am getting a duplicate architecture linker command error and i am not sure why it is giving me this any ideas
student,on lab09 we know how to use valgrind to check the memory leak but how to use valgrind to find out segfault more specifically what is the command for segfault check
student,im currently working on the implementation of player but when i try to create the global instance of each class for the factory function to return a pointer to i am met with the error object of abstract class type simpleplayer is not allowed the line this error happens on looks like this static simpleplayer gsimple directly below this line i do the same thing for the counting player but no error is thrown i think i know what the error is trying to tell me but i cant think of anything to do to make vs happy ive created an implementation for each virtual function including the ones that simple player doesnt need and even tried creating a blank destructor
student,so the spec says to be careful about the integer divison of 32 are we supposed to pay the player using integer division or do we have to find a way around this to make it what the true payout should be the spec just says to be careful
student,do i need to declare two member varible of type hand in player drived class such as hand dealer hand player
student,do we need to submit the test for competitor
student,im getting this error error cannot convert ‘simple ’ to ‘player’ in return ive declared simpleplayer as a static simple global variable ive implemented all functions in player in simple and im returning simpleplayer
student,
student,do we declare extra functions we make in blackjackcpp as static thanks
student,if i want to use next in driver program should i use something like playerdecknext or playerdecknext i am confused
student,for the driver program if cards are fewer than 20 in the deck should we call resetthen reshuffle
student,in blackjackcpp if deck is a member variable of player classnot a pointer to a deck should i use playerdeckcardsramaining or playerdeckcardsremaining i am confused
student,there are no requires clauses for the card functions should we assume that the inputs will actually be ranks and suits or should we throw errors if something other than a rank or suit are input into card functions
student,will i lose points if put all my player test in one cpp file
student,do you want our hand numbers to start at 0 or 1 as in when we print hand bankroll
student,for the destructor it sounds like we use delete data again but this results in a double deletion error described in the memory models lecture because delete data was already used in grow any help
student,confused as to how to use delete here in grow the spec says to use delete to release the memory from the data array i would think this would mean to just put delete data but im not sure and i dont really know how to use valgrind to check any help
student,i keep failing the autograders blackjacktest00 does anybody have any advice on how i can scrutinize my code to find at least one bug i have looked through 300 hands 100 hands for simplecountingcompetitor in the blackjack program and didnt find a bug thanks
student,in terms of writing descriptive tests for counting player what should i include in the file so that i can access the counting subtype i tried include playerh but it gives an error include playercpp also does not work any suggestions
student,i made counting a subclass of simple so i could use simples draw function within counting virtual bool drawcard dealer const hand player return simples draw function with same arguments but im getting a no matching function for call
student,do we need to include the destructor in our subclasses of player as well im getting compiler errors
student,should we call expose and shuffle in the driver or one of the member functions i imagine shuffle will have to be called from the driver but should expose be called from the driver as well or from draw
student,in the draw function in player you need to use the hand value member variable to see if the total is 17 12 etc but every line where i use it i get an error saying its private to the hand class i thought this error was only supposed to arise if i try and change the value not just see it for example i thought this shouldnt give me an error if playervalue 17 but it is why is this
student,are we allowed to include all the h files for each cpp implementation like for playercpp can we include playerh deckh cardh and handh
student,are there any requirements to command line such as the range of bankroll and hands
student,do we need to consider the condition when the require clauses are not statisfied when writing the tests for example we should fail the test if the n for shuffle is larger than 52
student,in actual blackjack game i believe a player is not allow to hit for more than 3 cards in a hand meaning at most 5 cards in a hand do we have to account for that lets say a player has two of spades and two of diamonds and after the player hits he get three of spades three of diamonds four of spades does the player continue to hit
student,in our competitor class we have a private int variable called count derived from counting player that gets incremented by expose correctly however after our bet function is called the count is somehow reset back to zero after expose is correctly used to make the count 3 checked by placing cout statements in both the bet and expose functions i know this is probably hard to figure out without seeing the code but if anyone has any ideas that would be greatly appreciated
student,when i try to run blackjack 100 3 simple blackjackout i get a segmentation fault and when i use valgrind i get blackjack blackjackcpp26 int mainint const char assertion argc 4 failed i am not sure why but does anyone know why assertargc 4 would fail
student,i am getting a compilation error when submitting to the autograder my code compiles runs and produce output identical to blackjacktest00outcorrect when i test it any ideas as to what may be causing the compilation error im compiling using the instructions to build the project in the specs thanks
student,is blackjackcpp allowed to use the player factory function
student,if the player is not dealt a natural 21 but dealt a total of 11 by a three and a eight he will hit if he is then dealt a 10 giving him a total of 21 does play still progress to the dealer
student,so i tried to compile the code right after downloading aka before changing it at all and i got the error undefined symbols for architecture x8664 main referenced from implicit entrystart for main executable ld symbols not found for architecture x8664 clang error linker command failed with exit code 1 use v to see invocation any ideas what is going on i am in the correct directory with all the files when attempting to compile i am editing code with sublime on a mac

student,can someone help me figure out how i am messing up my polymorphism to get this error i define my players by creating a player pointer and returning the factory function and i have my static instances of each player in my playercppam i defining the functions in the playercpp file incorrectly
student,wait is there no lecture on 1119 and 1126 after viewing schedule of topics im kind of confused after that announcement was made
student,ive gone through task 1 and 2 no problem the code compiles and passes the test cases along with removing the large memory leak in valgrind however once i try to use delete on data in the destructor the code compiles but throws this error when ran glibc detected lab09 double free or corruption top 0x0000000000e8a050 backtrace lib64libcso60x37f2a75e76 lib64libcso60x37f2a789b3 lab090x400cf5 lab090x400e71 lab090x401a4a lib64libcso6libcstartmain0xfd0x37f2a1ed5d lab090x400bf9 memory map 0040000000403000 rxp 00000000 001d 1580925662 afsumicheduuserckcknarrelab09lab09 0060200000603000 rwp 00002000 001d 1580925662 afsumicheduuserckcknarrelab09lab09 00e8a00000eab000 rwp 00000000 0000 0 heap 37f260000037f2620000 rxp 00000000 fd00 8651295 lib64ld212so 37f281f00037f2820000 rp 0001f000 fd00 8651295 lib64ld212so 37f282000037f2821000 rwp 00020000 fd00 8651295 lib64ld212so 37f282100037f2822000 rwp 00000000 0000 0 37f2a0000037f2b8a000 rxp 00000000 fd00 8651296 lib64libc212so 37f2b8a00037f2d8a000 p 0018a000 fd00 8651296 lib64libc212so 37f2d8a00037f2d8e000 rp 0018a000 fd00 8651296 lib64libc212so 37f2d8e00037f2d8f000 rwp 0018e000 fd00 8651296 lib64libc212so 37f2d8f00037f2d94000 rwp 00000000 0000 0 37f360000037f3683000 rxp 00000000 fd00 8651297 lib64libm212so 37f368300037f3882000 p 00083000 fd00 8651297 lib64libm212so 37f388200037f3883000 rp 00082000 fd00 8651297 lib64libm212so 37f388300037f3884000 rwp 00083000 fd00 8651297 lib64libm212so 37f9a0000037f9a16000 rxp 00000000 fd00 8651300 lib64libgccs44720120601so1 37f9a1600037f9c15000 p 00016000 fd00 8651300 lib64libgccs44720120601so1 37f9c1500037f9c16000 rwp 00015000 fd00 8651300 lib64libgccs44720120601so1 37faa0000037faae8000 rxp 00000000 fd00 12464649 usrlib64libstdcso6013 37faae800037face8000 p 000e8000 fd00 12464649 usrlib64libstdcso6013 37face800037facef000 rp 000e8000 fd00 12464649 usrlib64libstdcso6013 37facef00037facf1000 rwp 000ef000 fd00 12464649 usrlib64libstdcso6013 37facf100037fad06000 rwp 00000000 0000 0 7fa2fb13d0007fa2fb142000 rwp 00000000 0000 0 7fa2fb1670007fa2fb16a000 rwp 00000000 0000 0 7fffbd27a0007fffbd28f000 rwp 00000000 0000 0 stack 7fffbd2ea0007fffbd2eb000 rxp 00000000 0000 0 vdso ffffffffff600000ffffffffff601000 rxp 00000000 0000 0 vsyscall what does this mean and how can i resolve it valgrind also shows that it does not resolve the second memory leak

student,for grow function i donot understand step 3 for step 12 i did datacapacity 2 datacapacity new intdatacapacity how to copy from the old array
student,hello im just wondering if i have this right when you derive a class from a parent class and initialize an instance with a pointer to the parent class the constructor first runs in the parent class none or virtual if an adt and then runs in the derived class then when you delete the class via pointer the destructor first runs in the derived class and then calls the destructor of the parent class is this right
student,hello im just wondering what the deal is with labs it looks like i 3 out of the last 8 labs are missing but ive done every single one so far im really confused right now have they not been posted yet or
student,i assume this is good practice but how can it be done without a member function defined in cardh
student,do we need to separate the declarations and the implementations of our derived player classes
student,do we output player wins if heshe gets a natural 21
student,what happens if for example a player is dealt a two of spades and a two of hearts and then gets an ace which counts as 11 since he doesnt bust and hits again and is dealt another ace obviously you dont want this card to have the value of 11 so addcard should change soft to false right my handissoft function returns the boolean soft but in playercpp handissoft should still be true since there exists an ace that is counted as 11 in the hand right how can i fix this bug
student,1 do we reset the deck after each hand 2 what if for some reason the deck runs through all the cards and is empty when would we reset it
student,if the dealer is dealt a natural 21 does he not hit it isnt very clear in the spec
student,i have a stress test case that i was planning to submit with my project the test takes a really long time to run more than 10 seconds i know that in engr 101 the autograder would detect if a part of execution takes a long time to run and determines it an infinite loop would this executable be flagged as having an infinite loop
student,i seem to be having a problem with the shuffle and cut portion of the driver program ive written a function that takes the deck and makes cuts seven times the problem is i am cutting at different places than the correct file is cutting at i dont really understand how thats possible since it should be handled by the rand function getcut im getting the first cut correct for 39 but my next cut is at 33 instead of 22 and subsequent cuts after that are also wrong is there something else im supposed to be using along with the getcut function im not really sure what i could be doing that is changing what the output of getcut is
student,hi there trying to attempt testdriven development but got stuck on trying to write test cases for draw in playerh i think more specifically i am not sure what to make of hand player and how to add card values to the players hand with the limited interface we were given does it involve make our own private functions any general advice on how to write test cases for draw would be greatly appreciated
student,can our getrank function be more then just return rank can i return rank 2 because right now the rank of a two is zero the rank of a three is 1 and so on
student,does competitor have to be a subclass of counting or can we make it a subclass of simple or player as well
student,since everyone construct different competitor class how does autograder test if our competitor is correct
student,what does expose mean i donot understand what does it mean by let the playersee
student,in the hand class there is function called addcard do i have to make sure addcard cant add the same card twice will autograder test that
student,if the player is dealt a natural 21 do we only print the output player dealt natural 21 specifically should this be immediately followed by hand x bankroll y or do we output the players total and player wins first sorry for the very specific case but i want to make sure i have correct output the spec is not 100 clear on this one case
student,are we supposed to include cstring into playercpp in order to use strcmp to make sure the strings are the correct ones in player factory
student,so once the last card is dealt in a deck if that happens where should the next pointer point to like back to the first card in the deck or what
student,note if shuffle is called on a deck that has already had some cards dealt those cards should first be restored to the deck in the order in which they were dealt preserving the most recent postshuffledpostreset state this function produces no output does this mean if you dealt two of spades three of spades and four of spades and then shuffled the deck that you add those three to the end of the nonshuffled deck and then shuffle the whole thing
student,for some reason i seem to be getting 3 loss records instead of twolab09cpp12 is it because my pushback code is wrong 6781 heap summary 6781 in use at exit 1260 bytes in 6 blocks 6781 total heap usage 7 allocs 1 frees 1284 bytes allocated 6781 6781 20 bytes in 1 blocks are definitely lost in loss record 1 of 3 6781 at 0x4a07152 operator newunsigned long vgreplacemallocc363 6781 by 0x400d46 arrayintvectorarrayintvectorint intvectorlab09cpp12 6781 by 0x4010b6 main lab09cpp8 6781 6781 40 bytes in 1 blocks are definitely lost in loss record 2 of 3 6781 at 0x4a07152 operator newunsigned long vgreplacemallocc363 6781 by 0x400e31 arrayintvectorgrow intvectorlab09cpp104 6781 by 0x400f2b arrayintvectorpushbackint intvectorlab09cpp30 6781 by 0x40119d main lab09cpp12 6781 6781 1200 bytes in 4 blocks are definitely lost in loss record 3 of 3 6781 at 0x4a07152 operator newunsigned long vgreplacemallocc363 6781 by 0x400e31 arrayintvectorgrow intvectorlab09cpp104 6781 by 0x400f2b arrayintvectorpushbackint intvectorlab09cpp30 6781 by 0x4018cc main lab09cpp41
student,i wrote my functions in deck for rest shuffle and deal but i know they arent correct because i have not done anything with or modified this at all i dont really have a clue what to do with this in any of these three functions do i need to make this point at something maybe can anyone help me and give me hintssuggestions thanks
student,is it possible that the autograder will use arrangements of the deck besides a newly opened deck when testing the driver the full game of blackjack
student,here is my code for intializing the deck int i 0 for int j 0 j 13 j cardsjrank j cardsjsuit i and i repeat it for i 1 2 3 for the rest of the suits i know this is wrong because you cant set an enum equal to an int how would i convert i and j to the enum equivalent
student,im just a little confused with playercpp from what ive gathered we are declaring 3 subclasses of player at the top then implementing them below are we supposed to invent our own member functions and variables or are we just supposed to implement the ones in the player class specific to each different player
student,when im trying to declare global variables for simple counting and competitor xcode keeps telling me that variable type simple is an abstract class but it isnt giving me an error for declaring variables for counting and competitor
student,are we supposed toallowed to add helper functions in blackjackcpp to use in main for things like dealing
student,if we already had an ace in our hand and we were counting it as soft and then we got another ace we would change only one of them to hard correct
student,am i allowed to make and implement get functions for the private member variables of the hand class
student,when we add cards are we actually creating an array object that stores whatever card was dealt and assigns value accordingly or are we just looking at the value of the card that was dealt and dont have to worry about actually storing the card
student,using the os function they gave us at the end of the spec i keep getting 0 of 0 or 3 of 1 instead of two of spades and five of hearts i went back and looked at how cardprint worked in project 3 and they used an array of cstrings to print out the cards not the enumerations rank or suit do we have to make our own arrays like this
student,here is the terminal output bash41 g pedantic wall werror o1 c cardcpp o card bash41 card bash card permission denied just trying to test cardcpp and getting this any idea why
student,do we have to make our own header files for each of the players subclasses
student,can someone explain a doubly linked list verses a singly linked listl thanks
student,is there anything more to do in this function than to reset a private member variable that keeps track of count to zero
student,when trying to return rank in getrank in the cardcpp file xcode tells me that i cannot refer to class template rank without a template argument list what does this mean
student,i have two questions regarding the competitor class 1 can i include deckh for the competitor class of course my other classes do not use anything from deck 2 can i add extra public functions and change the driver program to use these functions if the competitor is playing
student,do we subtract from the bankroll in the bet functions i assume yes but i didnt see anything in the spec about it
student,is it correct to write test case files for every single boundary and general case scenario for example in player when testing the draw function would it make sense to test every possible scenario for hard and soft aces example file21 players hand total is 17 without any ace and dealer has a ace player should stand file22 players hand total is 17 with a soft ace and dealer has a 10 player should stand file23 players hand total is 17 with a hard ace and dealer has a 10 player should stand
student,dealer is dealt ace of clubs and then three of clubs hole card that means his value should be 14 after player plays his hand and then stands dealer plays his hand he is first dealt jack of spades which would bring his value to 24 shouldnt the handplaying end here since dealer busts i dont understand why in the correct output dealer is then dealt eight of diamonds after already busting this is the correct output given to us hand 2 bankroll 95 player bets 5 player dealt king of hearts dealer dealt ace of clubs player dealt seven of hearts players total is 17 dealers hole card is three of clubs dealer dealt jack of spades dealer dealt eight of diamonds dealers total is 22 dealer busts
student,in cardcpp i declared two enums for the rank and suit which i use in the other files would this cause an issue because there is a file dependency with the variables or does that only apply to functions
student,im confused about the format of the overview files in each decktestoverview and playertestoverview we are required to list the files and the behaviors we are checking for in each file how should we go about formatting this is it acceptable to just write decktest00cpp tests to make sure boundary cases of shuffle function work properly decktest01cpp tests blah blah
student,i have looked through the specs and i am pretty sure the minimum wager is always 5 but i need to know if that is correct please let me know
student,this is a silly question but im confused as to what bugs could occurfor example in shuffle what is there that could possibly go wrong thanks
student,what is the extra credit on the gradebook for thank you
student,in my competitor class which i made a subclass of the counting i tried to access a member variable that exists in counting but i get an error that says the member variable is a member variable of counting i thought the point of inheritance was that every subclass would receive all the functions and member variables of the previous classes why can i not use this member variable in my subclass
student,this was probably mentioned before but im not surecan we always assume that the deck that will be given to us will be a well formed one like it will start out full and have all 52 cards thanks
student,should the hands for a player be member variables of the player class or should they be managed in the driver program
student,when shuffling a partial deck is the top card the card that was dealt first or the card that was just dealt
student,none of my files compiled because there was a lone slash at the end of a comment line this gets tragic sometimes folks keep on all of you
student,what is the blackjacktest00 compilation failed for mine dont know why that didnt work
student,as a student who sometimes watches deorio online i feel slighted since i miss out on arguably the most important parts of his lectures sometimes i feel he does it just to spite me please stop this injustice thank you concerned student
student,we want to test our playercpp and pass in cards to the expose function are we allowed to include cardh in our test cases for creating cards
student,so when i was creating more memory for more spots in the data array in the lab by doubling it in size the compiler eventually throws an error which i am assuming is saying that the array has gotten too big will i be marked down if i just increase the array size by 1 each time when i do that everything works perfectly
student,are we declaring the derived class of player in playercpp the pdf says we cannot modify h file but it would be messy to declare an class in cpp and not a good interface any suggestion
student,player is dealt a king and a six so his hand valueis 16 since this is not a natural 21 he plays his hand meaning he draws until he either stands or busts the next card in the deck is ten of hearts since the players hand value is between 13 and 16 and the card to be dealt is not between 2 and 6 i thought that player should hit i dont understand why according to blackjacktest00outcorrect player stands when given the option to add a ten to his hand of value 16
student,when were shuffling by alternately putting cards from the right and left arrays into the cards array how do we go about incrementing the right and left by only one while incrementing the cards array by two for each time around the for loop ive been trying tons of different things but i cant figure it out
student,im a little bit confused on what exactly the expose function is supposed to do in the player class specifically the part that says effects allows the player to see the newlyexposed card c do we have to do something with this new card or is it simply a way to count the cards for the counting player
student,in blackjackcpp we are supposed to deal 4 cards one face up to the player one face up to the dealer one face up to the player and one face down to the dealer when it says deal to the dealer does it mean create a hand for the dealer and then add cards to that hand
student,should we also create tests cases for our competitor player as well
student,do we need getset functions for every single member variable do we only need one or the other sometimes thanks
student,would it be acceptable to make the competitor hit at different values than simple or is this not diverse enough our idea was to see if a player that takes a higher risk plays better for example the player has a hard hand with 18 and he hits
student,so we decided to keep count inside of the counting player class but when i write a getter function for the private count variable the compiler tells me that it doesnt recognize it inside of the player object i think this is because im creating my counting player variable via the player factor and since upcasting is done at runtime the compiler will only recognize that variable as the abstract player object which doesnt contain the getcount function how do i get around this thanks
student,does the dealer go in playercpp or the driver
student,do we have to use the exact naming convention as the specs described for the player tests
student,the specs say to subtract one when he sees a face card but what if the facecard is the fist card he sees then his count would be 1 or is the initial count amount meant to be something other than 0 thanks
student,if our program takes commandline input as in project 3 and project 4 should main have an rme
student,in our shuffle function when we make the two arrays left and right and we are indexing through them how can we check if the index of the array is empty since it is an array of cards
student,for the number of cards remaining if you deal two cards then shuffle then deal another two cards and check how many cards were remaining it would be 48 right because the deck was never reset or should the next pointer always be reset to the first card in the deck in the shuffle function which would make the above answer 2
student,so the spec says that the test file should return anything but 0 if the functions are buggy but how do we test for deck in this way for example instead of declaring each card with the correct rank and suit am i supposed to just use deal to see if the next card is equivalent to the second index of the array etc
student,when will the autograder be up
student,should the next pointer be pointing to the last card in the deck like cardsdecksize because when you are dealing a deck of cards you deal from the top not the front for example if i had a brand new deck would next be the two of spades or the ace of diamonds
student,in the driver what type of strategy does the dealer use to play do we treat the dealer as a simple player
student,im having trouble working out the implementation for handissoft obviously if adding 11 to the hand would make it over 21 we would opt for a hard ace but how are we supposed to know for an ace already in the hand that it can change from 11 to 1 or vice versa if all we have to keep track of the hand is the total value
student,for example i have value of 9 ace opens up 21 lets say another ace opens up 9111 21 lets say another hit is called and a 5 opens up 9115 16 another 5 opens up 91155 21 so for the handcpp the handissoft and handaddcard functions can either keep it simple to one ace can be 11 and another ace will be 1 under this situation or should we code for scenerio with two aces with possibilities of 1 and 11 1 and 1 11 and 1
student,is there a simple makefile command to compile and run all of my deck tests only
student,is there any way we can print out our constructed deck so we know if we did it right or not we cant print the rank and suit of each card because they are private
student,im running into an issue when i use the given test case for deck the before card changes from two of spades to four of spades after shuffle is called and the deck gets shuffled correctly but before for some reason gets changed i have gdbd this multiple times and im unsure why before is being altered any suggestions are appreciated
student,our shuffle function seems to work fine when only shuffling the deck of cards once however when we try to simply put the body of the function within a for loop the assertbeforegetrank aftergetrank evaluates to false any suggestions would be greatly appreciated
student,right now im calling playerfactory multiple times in my player tests each time for a different player pointer that i run different test cases for the player declarations look like this player p1 playerfactorycounting the problem is p2 starts off with p1s last value for count a private member variable that is altered throughout the test cases in other words the value of count is not being reset to 0 after the second call to playerfactory im worried that i implemented the static global variables wrong before defining playerfactory i declare static global variables of the various player types to new players by calling the constructors is this not right
student,do we need to write constructors in our derived classes of players
student,
student,i am confused if we are writting test functions for the handcpp implementation in playertests or should we have handtests00 and more
student,some of the rme given to us in project 4 modify this is this the same as modifying the object
student,i am having a hard time figuring out how to change an ace from 11 to 1 in order to avoid a bust if the ace was not the last card added to the total does anyone have a tip on how to do this
student,the first task is to implement a card adt so do we create a file in linux called cardcpp ourselves
student,are we suppose to implement the base class member functions and than override the functions that has distinct implementation for the derived classes for example i have class simpleplayer public player class countingplayer public player class competitorplayer public player should i copy paste the draw function from simpleplayer to countingplayer or should i just let the base class draw function take care of it for both the classes
student,why does every member function of the base player class equal 0 in playerh do we modify this
student,at what point do we storeinitialize bankroll can we do this in the bet function our constructor initializes bankroll to 0 but when do we actually input a value for it
student,i am trying to create a count variable in my playercpp file in the private section of the counting player class when i compile the code this error pops up i googled the error and it appears that the fix is to include count in the playerh file since we are not allowed to modify the playerh file is there any other way i can fix this error
student,hey guys just finishing hand had a small question i get that ace can be counted as 11 or 1 if the ace is going to make you bust you should make it count for 1 otherwise count for 11 that was my logic for hand but im assuming thats not 100 correct an ace can change value after another card has been played correct so if you were dealt a 3 then an ace total would be 14 if you are then dealt a queen total would still be 14 correct are we accounting for this change from softhard in handcpp or do we do it later just curious because i havent got to the player functions yet i know in handcpp you dont have access to the cards in the players hand so i am assuming you account for this change of what the ace counts as later can anyone confirm thanks
student,in regards to professor deorios 230 400 lecture i would like to kindly ask my fellow students to refrain from interrupting the professor when he is trying to speak it seems like many of the students in the front sorry to generalize feel that they do not need to raise their hand to ask questions during the lecture this is a disruption to both the professor and other students who are trying to learn i kindly ask that if you have a question then please raise your hand so that the professor can call on you at an appropriate time thanks
student,i have 3 static global variables declared outside the scope of my playerfactory function 1 for each type of player i used the slides in lecture 12 to get the overall format of declaring static global variable but when i try to return the address of one of these variables within playerfactory i get an error message that says cannot initialize return object of type player with an rvalue of type simple am i doing something wrong in my static global variable declarations
student,i might totally be missing something stupid here but how does the counting player play hisher hand does heshe play their hand the same way as the simple player
student,for the competitive player how much difference would we need to code do we need to implement a separate draw function or can we just change the betting strategy
student,1 when testing my card constructor with the rank and suit inputs i am trying to make a card jake but when i initialize the card it only seems to work if i write card jake cardcardranktwocardsuitspades so i was wondering why i need all of those rather than just having the inputs be two and spades 2 ive implemented getrank and getsuit yet when i print jakegetrank or jakegetsuit to the output i am getting 0 for both any reasons why this could be happening thanks
student,from the rme of shuffled in playercppp it says effects tells the player that the deck has been reshuffled i have no idea how to go about doing this i was thinking of creating a new data member but how would i know if shuffle was called or not
student,this is a silly question but i dont really understand the expose function at all also for the simple player it says to do nothing for shuffle and expose events…does that mean for these two functions we just have an empty function body
student,what would i put in the command line if i just wanted to test deckcpp
student,when i add a card to a hand how do i convert the rank that is returned when i call getrank into an integer value to be added to the value variable of the hand class or should i be using a different approach
student,i couldnt find anywhere in the spec that said our shuffle function had to shuffle 3 times just confirming if our shuffle function does need to do 3 shuffles or only 1 shuffle also if 7 cuts are chosen wouldnt this shuffle 7 times
student,can somebodybetter be gsi do a summary of the use of static so far i am a little confused about the use of static such as static helper function in proj2 global static instance static in class etc
student,i am wondering why there is only a default constructor for handcpp where is the normal one
student,i keep getting the compiler error ‘card’ in class ‘deck’ does not name a type any ideas of why
student,hey guys so im using visual studio as my main compiler except im having troubles compiling my projects when i click run windows debugger especially for project 3 it would say that main function is already declared in cardtests is there a way i could include all the files in the same project file but still run without calling on it thanks
student,if originally you had an ace in your hand and it was in your best interest for the ace to be an 11 but later after hitting a few times you busted can the ace be considered a 1
student,weve covered the topics including dynamic and static variable in the mondays lecturehoweverwhat exactly is the difference of dynamic functionif really exists and static functionhelper function in project2
student,how are we supposed to write reset without any inputs doesnt it need to know the variable name of the deck otherwise we have to create a whole new deck
student,can we add member variables to simple or counting player i know they have to inherit from player which doesnt have any member variables but i cant think of any other way to keep track of the count
student,my partner and i just finished up our deck tests and before we move on want to make sure they run correctly with the spec however make mytests requires that we also have playertests but we havent reached that yet is there a way we can run through our deck tests without using mytests
student,hey class im having some trouble with accessing my classes in my test files on the test file i have included include deckh include cardh include handh include playerh include cassert include iostream on my playercpp i have included include playerh include iostream include cassert include cstring and i have coded for class simpleplayer in my playercpp file as a derived class however when i try to initialize a simpleplayer in my testing file as such simpleplayer bob i get an error saying that unknown type name simpleplayer i dont think im misspelling anything though i am confused about how to approach this error any help would be appreciated
student,how to implement addcard and discardall i am a little confused with the hand classsince there is no array for private member variablesany hint should be great
student,my inclination is that its just how people designed c to be and that its “cheaper memorywise
student,what is the correct definition of factory function i know we talked about this in the lecture but i forgot about this
student,i just realized that were only supposed to submit tests for the deck and counting player but we already wrote tests for the simple player and competitor so is it fine if we submit those or should we only submit the counting player tests
student,the spec says to name the first file in decktestoverview as decktest00cpp however we have already been given a file called decktest00cpp are we expected to use this as our first test case in decktestoverview thanks
student,when will the project 4 autograder be up
student,out of strict curiosity is the randcpp implementation something that the professors and the gsis are able to write themselves or furthermore would they be able to fully understand the code or is it a simple copy paste from a source
student,im working on deckshuffle and trying to copy the cards into two temporary left and right card arrays but i keep getting this error iso c forbids variable length array left what is going on here thanks
student,from the project specification this is what ive gathered about how playertestxxcpp are evaluated we are only writing tests that apply to a player the points to a counting object obviously we should write tests for simple and competitor however these are not submitted in playertestxxcpp thus no playertestxxcpp should include eg player plyr playerfactorycompetitor we are testing that the functionality of a counting player behaves as described in the project specification that is we are not just testing that the effects clauses of the player rmes hold eg we could test that the player bets double the minimum after being expose d two jacks and then the minimum after shuffled is called we cannot include playercpp in our tests but we can include playerh deckh handh and cardh if an instructor could confirm or disconfirm my assumptions it would be greatly appreciated
student,for example if there are 22 cards left in the deck and a new hand start do i need to shuffle the deck after player get his second card or i only need to consider the shuffle at the beginning of the hand
student,can we add a nonstatic getcount and setcount to our counting player and use that for our competitor or should we declare a new member variable in oh we were said its fine to add those get count and set count functions but in 1671 i read that we arent supposed to add getter and setter functions which one is it
student,in euchre we had to test that the command line arguments were formed properly printing an error message if they were not do we need to do the same for blackjack
student,does the player only bet at the beginning of the class or he can keep betting each time he hits
student,in playerfactory i tried using strcmp but it isnt working if strcmps simple 0 do stuff however when i try and run blackjackcpp with simple as one of my arguments it goes into my else statement that catches anytime an incorrect argument is passed any help is very appreciated
student,for my handcpp i have part of my function that uses a switch case with the enum rank like we did in class everything about my syntax is seemingly correct and i include cardh so that the enum is there however when i try to compile it says error two was not declared in this scope error three was not declared in this scope error ace was not declared in this scope but i dont seem to see why wouldnt it be declared if i included cardh which has the enum declaration in it
student,is handissoft simply a getter function
student,im going to need a private variable to keep track of count so should i implement a helper function getcount to return it and make it static right and i would not add this to the h correct
student,i just want to be sure that im interpreting the spec correctly if you shuffle a shuffled deck you do not first reset it to a newly opened deck you shuffle the shuffled deck right
student,ive never learned python could someone please give me a quick rundown on what the py file is doing thanks in advance
student,when i try to create my static global instances of the three players i am getting an error that says variable type simple is an abstract class heres what i tried static simple gsimple did i implement the class simple wrong or did i create a static global instance incorrectly
student,are we allowed to make a non default constructor for hand because if we can it would make testing a lot easier will the autograder that tests our test cases have one though thanks
student,i was getting a linker error when running my deck tests until i included cardscpp im a bit confused only because the sample deck tests didnt require including cardscpp and i thought it only need to include cardsh and im not sure if i missed something if anyone has some clarification on this that would be much appreciated
student,im having a hard time avoiding magic numbers in this project it seems like we have so many numbers we have to use according to the spec that it would almost be superfluous to create a ton of extra variables any tips
student,are we supposed to test competitor
student,i wrote my test cases first as described for one of my test cases it hits the end and returns 0 from main however when i run the exe for this test either alone or with the python script it segfaults after it returns zero this is the end of the code for my test case cout pass 02 endl return 0 cout still here endl end main i added the still here to see if maybe it was still running after the return 0 but the terminal output is just pass 02 segmentation fault someone help please x
student,i just want to show the result of decktestcpp i am sure deckcpp compiles bash41 decktest00 segmentation fault
student,does anyone have tips on how to alternate cards from left and right to get a shuffled deck would the best way be to do it all in one for loop with pointers to cards in left and right im not sure how to account for the cases in which left or right runs out of cards and you fill in the rest of the deck with the other segments cards
student,the spec says that deal returns the next card to be dealt i want to make sure that im comprehending this correctly i returned next so i returned the card that next points to and incremented next so that it points to the next card is this what we want to be doing or no also once we get to the last card do we point to the first card again or do we reset the deck or what do we do
student,since we are trying to make the competitor better than the counting player can we make the competitor cheat such things as giving himself 21 or anything else silly we can think of
student,im trying to use a for loop in the deck constructor but its saying that it expected a constructordestructor so can i not use that in the initializer list
student,1620 bbb is reserved today so where are their office hours going to be instead
student,after overloading the operator we are still getting 5 errors that look like undefined symbols for architecture x8664 cardcardcardrank cardsuit we are using namespace std and including cardh cassert and iostream anyone know whats going on
student,i have an error invalid use of class card my code is cardsjcardstaticcastcardrankfstaticcastcardsuiti what is wrong
student,i checked to see my score on lab08 this morning and it said it wasnt submitted is there anything i can do i submitted it in lab but it didnt go through the guy i worked with commented that we worked together in his submit and we had the same code is there anything i can do
student,if one of our test cases is given a buggy implementation is it ok for it to crash without reaching a return or assert statement for example say the error in the implementation was that an incorrect value was returned by deckcardsremaining which resulted in a segfault
student,right now my code prints 0 of 0 instead of two of spades so that must mean that cgetrank returns an integer representing the index of the rank in enum rank because when i overloaded the output operator i did os cgetrank etc so ive been trying to figure out how to access the rank to print the word not the integer but i cant seem to figure out how cardrankcgetrank doesnt work nor does anything else ive tried can anyone point me in the right direction
student,will we be responsible for making the cut point numbers truly random or just random truly random everytime the getcut function is called the same set of 7 numbers is close to impossible to repeat random everytime the getcut function is called the same set of 7 numbers is repeated
student,from what ive implicitly gathered in the spec a hand consisting of three aces should have a value of 13 and would not bust just to be certain can someone confirm for me that this is the case
student,i am a little confused about how we could go about using global static const constants if we cannot have file interdependencies for example if i declare the constants in cardcpp wouldnt it be a file interdependency if i used them anywhere outside of cardcpp ie deckcpp and if so how would i go about implementing a global constant correctly
student,im getting this error when i initialize a derived player why is the compiler yelling at me for this
student,if we have a hand inside of a player class can it be public or does it have to be private
student,so im assuming that inside of playercpp we declare 3 different subclasses of player inside of each of these classes we overload the functions found in the base class player and define them to do as the specs said for each player also were allowed to create our own publicprivate variables as we see fit like bankroll wager and we can also include other adts such as handcard etc correct thanks
student,for decktest files do we need to include all of the functions in deckh for each test file since were writing multiple files for this project can we divide the files in a way that one file only tests for some cases of reset and shuffle and not cardsremaining
student,in the bet function inside of player the spec is quite unspecific are we supposed to decrease the bankroll of the bet inside this function or does this come later
student,we are unsure of how to implement playerfactory without the use of dynamic memory we had remembered from lecture that professor deorio said not to use dynamic memory on this project
student,im getting this error when i am trying to use a test file i wrote can anyone suggest what my problem may be i am including cardh handh error g cardcpp handcpp handtestcpp o handtest undefined symbols for architecture x8664 handhand referenced from discardallfullhand in handtest164afeo discardallemptyhand in handtest164afeo addcardone in handtest164afeo addcardfullhand in handtest164afeo handvalue4aces in handtest164afeo handvalueempty in handtest164afeo handvaluegeneral in handtest164afeo ld symbols not found for architecture x8664 clang error linker command failed with exit code 1 use v to see invocation

student,can we assume if the bankroll is less than the minimum bet the simple player bets his entire bankroll the spec only says the counting player bets his entire bankroll
student,in the code provided in lab08cpp there is this line cout your code vat0 vat0 and vat3 vat3 endl endl for some reason when i run it stepbystep through the debugger vat3 is getting called before vat0 and my solution prints as your code vat0 1 and vat3 1 any ideas as to why this is it works when i split the provided testing code into two lines but ive used similar lines of code in the past and never encountered anything like this
student,so i understand the filter function takes in a function as a parameter but it doesnt state the number of parameters the fn function needs the example code we were given was the isodd function which takes in one integer as of now i have my code for the fn function taking in just one parameter what if the fn function had more than one parameter im not sure how to code to adapt to this
student,instructorsdo you think you could provide us with some data for how people did on project 3 not really sure how to gauge my performance on it otherwise
student,hello could someone please explain these rmes to me besides just stating what it says the second part of the first sentence is what im having trouble understanding effects returns the present value of the blackjack hand the highest blackjack total possible without going over 21 if the hand is over 21 any value over 21 may be returned
student,because each of our playertestnncpp unit tests only include playerh they can only see the player type and not each of the simple counting and competitor types which are in the playercpp file considering that what is returned from the playerfactory function in any given unit test cpp file will be of type player is there any way to test whether what is returned from the factory function is of the correct subtype of player ie simple counting competitor how would we write a unit test to test literally the only thing that playerfactory does
student,ive read the posts on being able to access the various ranks and suits by using an integer however i dont know how the syntax for this actually works for example i have in my code two loops with int i 0 and int j 0 referencing the rank and suit enums this should give me a two of spades when i do tempcardi cardj temp being my card in this case it throws an error
student,anyone have suggestions on how to go about implementing this i understand how to pick the ranksuit to assign to each index of cards but im not sure how to go about initializing each one when i cant access private member variables thanks
student,if i wont does that mean i arbitrarily choose strategy no matter how bad it is
student,how do we implement this card function stdostream operator stdostream os const card c also what is this function actually doing
student,just from reading the specification it seems that we should assume that commandline arguments will be entered correctly during the autogradertesting is this right to assume
student,im a little confused as to how blackjack works in the spec it says the first set of rules apply if the player has a hard count if the players hand totals 11 or less he always hits if the players hand totals 12 he stands if the dealer shows 45 or 6 if the players hand totals between 13 and 16 he stands if the dealer shows a 2 through 6 i dont understand why the player would ever stand if his total is less than 17 doesnt the dealer hit until the dealers total is at least 17 so wouldnt the player automatically lose if his total was less than 17
student,how come when i try to use my card constructor and call it with the integer values of the suit and rank i get an error that they are not valid inputs i thought we were allowed to do this
student,i assume we are supposed to put our derived classes in playercpp if i do this and try to create an instance of simple inside playertest00cpp i get this error playertest00cpp in function u2018int mainu2019 playertest00cpp12 error u2018simpleu2019 was not declared in this scope playertest00cpp12 error expected u2018u2019 before u2018bu2019 however if i put my derived classes inside playerh my program compiles
student,are we allowed to assume that the function other than the one that our tests are testing are correct eg if were testing deckshuffleint n can we assume that the deckdeal that will be used by the autograder will be correct
student,what is the command to run just the card tests i have already compiled but now i dont know how to run it
student,i keep getting error prototype for ‘cardrank cardgetrank’ does not match any in class ‘card’ my implementation is just return rank which i guess is wrong because its not working
student,is it safe for us to assume that the tests run by the gsis will use the same randcpp as we were given generating a random variable between 13 and 39 so that we dont have to check whether the inputs for shuffleint n are within the bounds of the card array
student,intsetremove can someone explain the step eltsvictim eltseltssize im trying to visualize this and i cant see how this line of code causes one of the array elements to be removed
student,i apologize if this has already been answered ive looked through other questions and still dont feel 100 confident about the answer the spec says not to write an extern function in handcpp that you use in playercpp i assume that this means we may not implement any helper function from playercpp in handcpp beyond this are we allowed to use member functions provided in the h files in other files for example could i create an instance of a hand in playercpp and use its handissoft member function is this still considered a violation of the file dependency rule thank you for your help
student,when n is 52 or 0 does that mean we do not shuffle the deck at all right
student,im trying to write a test case for hand but im getting a weird error can someone please what i am doing wrong
student,can someone explain this like in the function size that we have to implement and the ones after isnt there a special syntax for it too thanks
student,can someone explain this like in the function size that we have to implement and the ones after isnt there a special syntax for it too thanks
student,to add cards to the players hand should we have the hand as a public member of the player subclasses or can we add the cards when playerdraw is called or can we do either
student,whenever i try calling the card constructor in deckcpp the compiler says that i have an undefined reference to cardcard i have tried both compiling my deckcpp with include cardh and without this line in both tries i get the same undefined reference errors
student,when i implemented the getrank and getsuit functions i got an error saying that rank does not name a type i included the cardh file and copied the function header properly i believe is there something that i am missing thanks
student,for example when deciding to bet competitor would pick a random number between 0 1 if the number picked is 0 he bets otherwise he stays also competitor wages some random amount between 0 and his bankroll i know the specs say the competitor can play any strategy but do they really mean anything
student,to write some features i would like to have for competitor i would need to let player member functions access the deck and other variables declared in blackjack is this possible without passing these variables in which would break the polymorphism and require different prototypes more specifically i want to be able to deal cards from the deck to allow the competitor to split and ideally double the bet after it is placed double down although being able to do that would mean you could just bet huge amounts if you have a good hand so it would make sense if this were impossible
student,i have a double for loop that i am using to fill the array cards with 52 cards in the deck when i try to compile i am receiving the following error any ideas deckcpp in constructor ‘deckdeck’ deckcpp21 error no match for ‘operator’ in ‘deckthisdeckcardsindex curcard’ cardh7 note candidates are card cardoperatorconst card
student,does cathy still have office hours here today
student,im trying to test my cardcpp functions and terminal is giving me this error cardtests00 no such file or directory when i type ls it lists cardtests00 in the directory im currently working in what is going on here thanks
student,should the counting player be derived from the simple player if not how do we create one expose method for both without copying and pasting
student,random question what are delimiters and quotechars
student,when youre initializing a new hand with the constructor what should the default value for soft be or should that just be uninitialized
student,write a program that when linked against the implementation of the adt tests for the presenceabsence of that behavior page7 any idea what this means
student,can i includecmath in deckcpp
student,i just need a little clarification on reset do we basically implement this function the same way we implemented the deck default constructor if it is do we just call the deck default constructor in reset
student,lets have some clarification for what constitutes as buggy 1 does the buggy refer to our own code and the possibilities for errors 2 can bugs not adhere to the requires clause 3 is a joker or another strangely compiled deck considered a bug or is this unreasonable and not expected thank you
student,are we allowed to create functions not found in the header this regards deckcpp
student,what should happen when we try to deal one card from a deck that is on its last card then say we call deal again on that same deck that now has no cards what should happen
student,we are trying to test our deckdeck constructor but cannot figure out how to print out the cards in the deck we are using cout and then the appropiate index for the cards array but that does not seem to be working
student,im assuming we have to make our own prototypesheader files i keep getting compilation errors when trying to implement simple class within playercpp and we cant change playerh so we have to make our own header files
student,in deal do you put the card that next is pointing into a variable then increment next to point to the next card card card1 card1 next next return card1 i have done this but for some reason i always end up getting a seg fault
student,i was thinking about making a while loop that counts the amount of cards that are not two of spades but i just realized there is going to be one two of spades until that one card is going to be dealt is there any other way to count the cards in the deck
student,my code compiles and runs but im getting these errors without changing anything that was given to us whats wrong here why is this happening
student,where can i find the office hours for the professors of eecs 280
student,consider the following case a player has a hand with a value of 15 this hand contains a soft ace worth 11 if the player draws a 7 which would give the player a hand with a value of 22 is the player legally allowed to switch the ace to a hard value worth 1 and then have a value of 12 i dont know if this is allowed in blackjack and if we should account for these cases
student,for intpop back function in the lab i am confused as to how to make this worki just decremented the numelements variable its giving me a seg faulti dont know how to go about this thanks
student,should we declare the subclasses in playerh and define them in playercpp or both declare and define the subclasses in the cpp file
student,are hand tests necessary for this project i wrote some for my own sanity but they dont seem to be part of the specs just so im certain
student,i was thinking this morning at how after we submit our projects to the final autograder that thats the rest that we do with the project i thought that maybe a good idea of what the staff could do to foster a better learning experience would be for the final autograder and only the final autograder we could receive the input andor the output our program put out compared to the correct output giving this to students would allow them to reflect on what went wrong in their program and whyhow another thing this could really help with is the idea of implement test reimplementimprove given a certain period of time after we were given the final results from the autograder we could fix our programs and resubmit them for additional credit with only regards to the autograder score and not style this would cause students to have to relook at their programs and to also have left sufficient comments for themselves so that they would be able to once again easily pickup the project again and fix it im not sure how easy this idea would be but i think that it would be worth looking into i think that these days school is only about the last turn in and not reflecting over what went wrong and how to fix it hopefully staff and students agree with me that this would be a useful learning experience
student,anyone know how to solve this ive had this issue in the past
student,is there anyway to use a for loop inside a constructor or do we have to initialize all 52 cards
student,hello i am having a problem initializing the cards in the deck since i am not able to access the member variables of a specific card i do not know how to change the rank and suit furthermore the overloaded constructor cannot be used to initialize the values of the cards any tips to get me thinking thank you
student,i am still a little confused on what filter wants if we call filter3 for instance does that mean the array should only contain 3s or 3 elements total and does that mean we loop through the array in main or loop in filter thanks
student,i would like one to help with an outside project im doing
student,do we need to write test cases that will violate the requires clause for example should we test for shuffle100 or is this not needed also if we do need to test for this what would the output need to be
student,my partner and i were wondering if you call the shuffle function in deck with 0 as the input would the cards remain in the same order or be reversed a new deck starts with 2 of spades we were writing a test case about shuffling with 0 as input and we thought deck might be reversed
student,is it necessary that we create reset so that it manually sorts through the current deck to return it to its original state or is it okay if we just call deck and reassign cards to this
student,in the cardsremaining function of deck im having trouble figuring out how to keep track of how many cards are left we dont have a variable keeping track of how many cards have been dealt and i assume were not supposed to add one because were not supposed to modify h files
student,in the spec it says you must also declare a static global instance of each of the three players in playercpp finally in playercpp you should implement the following factory function that returns a pointer to one of these three global instances in the main function of my blackjackcpp i must created a pointer to a player and which type of player simple counting or competitor depends on the input and that cstring is handled by the player factory function but my player pointer in blackjackcpp holds the address of one of the three static global instances of player which were declared in playercpp would this be an instance of an interfile dependency im not very sure about what exactly constitutes interfile dependency as its never come up as an issue in previous projects or previous eecs courses
student,could someone explain how to compile and build in xcode for example if i wanted to 1 compile g filecpp o file 2 run file how would i do this for all you xcode users i have command line installed just trying to figure out how to use this
student,should we set up conditions to change a soft hand into a hard hand if the hands value goes above 21
student,is there any reason i would declare static global variables for playercpp as opposed to nonstatic ones is one or the other wrong or less preferred
student,why cant i assign next to cards in the deck constructor
student,i am pretty lost on the syntax that i am supposed to use to return the rank so far i did this cardrank getrank return rank how are we supposed to return the rank exactly if we do not have an array for them are we supposed to make a function template and an array of the ranks just like we did in project 3
student,i wrote the output operator function and everything for cardcpp and ran the card tests i get outputs like 0 of 0 which do correspond with the correct enum however i am not sure if this is correct or should it say two of spades
student,how do exam regrades work in this class how and when should we submit them
student,in class we discussed dynamic variables and delete only works for dynamics variables we had a slide that shows the following is wrong i wonder does the program compile or it compiles but crashes at runtime int i 0 local variable int pi pointer to local variable delete p error
student,so i know professor deorio talks about how we should be practicing the concepts learned in lecture on our own is there any online resources similar to codelab that will give us practice problems where we can refine our skills thanks
student,in the function stdostream operator stdostream os const card c im trying to compare the rank and suit of the card to figure out what to output but im having trouble getting the right scope im trying to use code of the form if cgetrank cardtwo os two but i get an error like no match for operator or something like that how can i access a rank such as two in the function
student,im writing cardcpp and when i got to the implementation of getrank i cant get it to compile my code looks like rank cardgetrank implementation but i get the compiler error error ‘rank’ does not name a type
student,is it ok to use arrays to store the enum values of rank and suit in this project i only ask because the cardh file in p3 used arrays and we were unsure if we would be penalized for using the same method of converting from enum integer values to cstring or string values
student,a little confused about the class hand in the member functions the rmes describe that they adddiscard cards to the hand since the the class hand contains only the member variables value and soft do the rmes actually mean addingdiscarding value getting a little mixed up with the euchre project thanks
student,reading through the spec i noticed the bit about not having any interdependent relationships between implementation files does this only apply to adding some sort of helper functions as in if i use a card custom constructor in deck that will not cause any problem because of the assumption that deckcpp will be compiled with a correct cardcpp
student,does overview have the list of specific behaviors for each of our testing files or should these also be written at the top of each test file
student,i noticed in the spec that in the 4th project submission we only have tests for player and deck does this mean that we will not be submitting test cases for card
student,why cant we declare something like string arr2xyzabc i already include string
student,what does the following message meani am sure my cardcpp works well it compiles cardtest00cpptext0x36 undefined reference to cardcard collect2 ld returned 1 exit status
student,i just finished cardcpp and i want to run the given cardtedst00i just complied the cardcpp what is the command
student,im not sure if ill need them yet but id like to know ahead of time are we allowed to declare helper functions inside of deckcppplayercpp etc thanks
student,i saw this funky looking piece of code in cardh effects writes the card to the stream for example two of spades stdostream operator stdostream os const card c are we to also implement that inside of cardcpp if so how do i start ive tried doing something like cardoperator but that isnt working not sure what to do with this function
student,so i am running into an issue when trying to include needed files in my playertests i started off by only including the h files this became an issues because there were no abstractions for my derived classes in the playerh file so my tests didnt know that the derived classes i had written existed so i then tried to include the playercpp file so that my tests could see those derived classes but then the compiler whined to me about a redeclaration of the playerfactory function because it has a prototype in the h file as well as an implementation in the cpp file so now i am stuck between a rock and a hard place with the only seemingly way to be added abstractions in the h file for my derived classes but the spec clearly states not changing the h files so i am stuck
student,class isosceles public triangle public effects sets base edge a void setbasedouble base a base compile error effects sets legs edges b and c void setlegdouble leg b c leg compile error i am a little confused on why cant isosceles access the member variables just like how triangle can
student,i am not understanding the reasoning on why should we put a const after a getter function such like this geta const the function isnt modifying the a member variable in any way it is just returning it
student,1 in the implementation of decks member function deal theres an issue of going off the end of the cards array in deal even though the requires clause states that the deck cannot be empty so the function will always return a valid card what happens when i return the last card in the array at index 51 with a newly opened deck if ive dealt all the previous 51 cards and i call deal once more the card returned would be the ace of diamonds however the next pointer would then have to increment one past cards51 which is not a valid address in the array how should i handle this is it okay to leave it be considering that the requires clause enforces the next pointer actually pointing to a valid index in the cards array and so deal would never be called in this situation 2 decks member function cardsremaining has a similar issue in order to return the correct number of cards i must add 52 to cards where cards is just the pointer to the first element in the array however adding 52 would give an address that is one past the end of the array is this okay considering that my implementation returns the correct number anyway 3 how are we to determine for every situtation which value 1 or 11 of the ace is more advantageous for the player i realize that if the players hand value is 10 and an ace is recieved then it should take the value of 11 and if the hand value is greater than 10 then 1 should be chosen but what of hand values less than 10 and what about if they are dealt two aces should one ace be 11 and the other be 1 or both of them are 1 a problem am i having is that hand does not keep track of which cards are in the hand only the total value how can we decide which value of the ace is more advantageous if we do not know what future cards will be dealt as an illustration of this lets say the player is dealt a 7 and an ace then the players hand value could be either 18 or 8 which value the ace takes depends on future cards if the player receives a king then the ace taking the value of 1 would clearly be more advantageous but if the player received a 3 then the ace should take the value of 11 but hand does not keep track of individual cards only the total if the ace is received then we must decide the value of the ace then and there how can we decide if it would be better for it to be 1 or 11
student,ive probably been at this for an hour trying to figure out how to convert from an integer inside deckcpp to an enum in cardcpp to give a list of things that have failed not all of which arethe smartest of implementations card00 cannot convert int to enum cardcardrank0cardsuit0 expected primary expression cardcardrank0cardsuit0 cardrank isnt a class cardrank r10 cant convert int to enum cardrank r1cardtwo garbage error cardcard0card0 expected unqualified id before numeric constant cardstaticcastcardrank0staticcastcardsuit0 garbage error i flipped through the past 3 lectures as well as the enum lecture slides and didnt find anything useful couldnt really find anything on google either
student,im not really sure what the overview file is supposed to be is it a text file of the form behavior description test00cpp behavior description test01cpp etc should the overview file actually do anything or is it there for viewing purposes only
student,as above
student,yes i am going to write test cases first i will also heed the advice to split them into multiple files and they must at least consist of a main function my questions are so within this main function would we be creating possibly false representation invariants or something and asserting that our code fails appropriately or are we creating test cases to specifically highlight correct adt implementations or both id imagine that there would be different ways to represent a player because we have several is a relationships and some of those ways would be correct and some incorrect so should our tests should be testing for both good and bad adt implementationsrepresentation invariants
student,note if shuffle is called on a deck that has already had some cards dealt those cards should first be restored to the deck in the order in which they were dealt preserving the most recent postshuffledpostreset state this function produces no output just so i am certain does this mean that all the cards that were dealt from the deck should return to the bottom of the deck in the same order they were dealt for example if the first two cards of an unshuffled deck were dealt 23 of spades would the last four cards of a deck before it was shuffled be kdiamond adiamond 2spade 3spade
student,my lab is printing this bash41 g wall werror o1 pedantic canvascpp shapescpp lab07cpp o lab07 bash41 lab07 area of shape 1 471238 area of shape 2 282743 area of shape 3 15
student,do we have to override the area and draw functions in circle im sooo confused
student,am i allowed to create a temporary array of 52 cards to implement this function would that even work considering shuffle is a member function instead of an ordinary function
student,here is what i have void circledrawcanvas canvas const ellipsedrawcanvas and im getting errors any help am i thinking of it wrong
student,tmpcclgp8cso in function circlecircledouble shapescpptext0x44 undefined reference to vtable for circle collect2 ld returned 1 exit status i have all header files
student,im trying to compile lab07 and i get the following error error redefinition of circle circle any ideas
student,i would think the circle draw function would be if distance formularadius then turn the pixel on but the draw function doesnt have the radius as an input do i need to make a getrad function or something
student,could someone help me with creating the circle constructor for lab 07 this is what i have so far circlecircledouble xradin double yradin xradxradin yradyradin but i know the constructor is only supposed to take in one radius and im getting errors anyway how do you make the circle constructor use the ellipse constructor which takes two arguments if circles constructor is only supposed to have one
student,could someone explainhint as to how to write circle in the header and cpp files i am beyond confused
student,code compiles for task 1 however the area for the circle is 0 and there is only one hashtag where the circle should be thoughts
student,for some reason my code is not drawing the rectangle it prints the area just fine and works in printing the other two shapes but i cant seem to find a problem any help or suggestions would be appreciated thanks
student,so for partnerships is there only one grade distributed to both people because only our gamecpp and euchrecpp codes are the same the other ones are different so i was wondering if the grade for all of them is the exact same thanks
student,i know that some people had issues with the compilation error when they submitted as did i i would like to know if we can come in to discuss this with an instructor because it is still confusing me as to why it happened and how it will affect my project 3 grade thanks
student,i know that the process of hand grading takes a while but i was wondering if there was any chance that we could be given a hint of what the p3 autograder score distribution looks like
student,i got an email last night from the autograderit was testing our test casesi thought our test cases would b handgraded n not for how many bugs they found and stuff could someone please explain hpw that score will b incorporated into our score
student,can you please tell what these tests were checking thank you
student,in the lab spec it says you should be able to write circle without declaring any new private member variables but because xrad and yrad are private in ellipse and derived classes dont inherit private members how is this possible
student,for task 2 it says to increase the size of the shapesarray to 2 change its type to shaperather than just ellipse and add to it a pointer to the circleyou just created i am very confused as to how to do this i looked at the lectures slides as well can someone please help me out here i think its mostly changing the type to shape that is tripping me up
student,when release
student,seg faults were pretty much the bane of my and im sure the tas existence that being said poor time management left me unable to practice testdriven development and it seems like that couldve really helped to avoid a lot of those seg faults for project 4 im going to really try to get a start in adopting testdriven development but are there any tips out there to avoid these critters do adts welcome some new kind of common error
student,just wondering are rmes needed for test functions that we created for example in playertestscpp thanks
student,when i try to build using make test i get the error cardtests cardtestsout packtests packtestsout playertests playertestsout euchre packin noshuffle 1 alice bob cathy drew euchretest00out make test error 1 when i build it individually line by line based off of the compiler it works just fine what does this mean
student,will we deal with a deck that is shuffled many different ways should we test for that thanks
student,i am passing the auto grader but when i do diff with my output and the correct output on linux it says they differ i used the exact same files as my partner whose didnt differ on linux any idea why this is happening
student,is it absolutely necessary to split our code into multiple functions if for example our gameplay function is 100150 lines
student,any idea when its going to be posted
student,cardprint works fine during the first trick but when it goes through the next time i cant print any cards for some reason i am assigning each one a new value based on the cards that need to be played in the second trick and then when i try to print the cards it doesnt work
student,will test cases be graded on the basis of having a certain number of them or will having a reasonable number of quality tests be enough i feel like my tests are pretty comprehensive but the files themselves dont look too long for card and pack
student,my code compiles fine on caen linux machines and it passes both published test cases and my own but when i submit to autograder im getting a compilation error running test cases running test cardtest00 pass running test packtest00 pass running test playertest00 pass running test euchretest00 compilation error running test euchretest01 compilation error running test cardtests compilation successful running test packtests compilation successful running test playertests compilation successful you passed 6 out of 8 test cases measuring 917 previous threads on similar problems suggested to ensure my includes are exactly as in the specifications but i corrected my includes and am still getting the above error messages im not sure what to do in case it helps a list of my dependencies follows cardh cardcpp cardh ie cardh is included in cardcpp cassert cstring iostream cstdlib cardtestscpp cardh cassert iostream packh cardh iostream packcpp packh string fstream packtestscpp packh cassert iostream playerh cardh playercpp playerh cassert iostream stringh playertestscpp playerh cassert cstring iostream gameh playerh packh gamecpp gameh cstdlib euchrecpp cstring cstdlib gameh
student,does suit hierarchy change depending on the trump suit ie is the original order is diamonds clubs hearts spades if the trump suit is hearts does the hierarchy change to hearts spades diamonds clubs
student,having a strange problem with playerplaycard its choosing the wrong card for one of the players in gamecpp so i thought it might be a problem with the function itself so i made a new test program created a player with a hand identical to the one in the test case and ran it and got the right card its only choosing the wrong card in gamecpp i made sure all the arguments are right and that the hand in gamecpp is right i have no idea why this is happening any help would be greatly appreciated
student,anyone ever have this problem does anyone know why i am using the debugger and breakpoints in xcode and before the array is passed into the function everything is fine but then once the array is passed into the function it only shows the first three elements of that array even though the function utilized all four elements to be exact it shows the name of the array which i can then click the arrow to see the first element and then it shows element 1 and 2 this is a 4element array i do indeed have a 4element array and all my code works so far passing test cases i just wanted to go back and do some more tests and wanted to be able to look at what cards each player has when doing the tests any help would be much appreciated thanks
student,signup in two different locations how do you prevent getting skipped like i just did im in the basement ugly and my name got removed from the list and i couldnt edit my location on the sign up either
student,the spec says use euchrecpp to perform system tests on your game i know that when we run euchrecpp it will check that parts of our command line have the right input however if were testing individual functions aka we dont check if the inputs are good through euchrecpp such as gameinit and gameplay isnt it possible to have a game that goes up to 1000000 points or worse 100000 points or fewer than 4 players or all these other weird cases
student,does anyone know any order of cards in the pack that i can use that tests rare game scenarios
student,do we output the error message starting with usage first or do we always start with outputting the command line what im asking is if our command line isnt properly entered will the output be usage first or will it be euchre wrongformat usage thanks
student,so i know were supposed to print out euchred when a euchre happens but do we have to print out march when a march happens
student,if seg fault occurs when you input euchre packin noshuffle 1 alice bob cathy drew euchretest00out in the terminal
student,say for example a team euchres the other team by taking all 5 tricks this is just supposed to be considered a euchre not a march right from my understanding our program should never print both march and euchre i just need clarification on this because the spec was a little unclear about this
student,if we make a custom stacked deck to test packcpp will it still be able to pass the autograder im just concerned because the makefile does not compile our packs so it might fail the assert functions
student,what percentage of the project grade is the test cases worth
student,when i make my final submission file it outputs in terminal all the files in it including cardcpp but when i submit it to the autograder i get this error error submission archive is missing the file cardcpp you have not been charged a submission i honestly have no idea where this error is coming from
student,but how exactly do you see the difference between what mine shows and the given euchretest00 i removed the q from the diff command which i copied and pasted from the makefile and it still didnt do what i wanted
student,are these files all supposed to cout packtests pass at the end which the project repo version seem to do rather than outputting playertests pass for playertests and cardtests pass for cardtests
student,we dont have euchretests00outcorrect and 01 downloaded and in the project folder somewhere
student,how do you print out a players name i tried cout gameptrplayersplayernumbername and got a massive error i included cstring so thats not the issue
student,my gamecpp is really long because i decided to do it without any helper functions i have commented it really nicely so the code is easy to follow despite being pretty beefy i was wondering if doing it this way is going to end up costing style points or will i still have the chance to get them all if i comment well
student,i pass both euchre tests on my computer but the autograder says that it fails both euchre testsanyone have any idea what could possibly cause this
student,im trying to verify that my code works beyond the published test cases i think the the easiest way to do so would be to compare the output to someone elses code for a long game
student,there is an annoucement about correcting the command for testing playertests however i downloaded the new makefile but the command in it was not updated are we supposed to change it when we submit the finaltar should we turn in the orginial unchanged makefile on ctools or the updated one
student,running test euchretest00 warning your program exited with nonzero status fail this is the only error im getting the detailed submission view doesnt tell me anything ie green gray red wrong answer etc what could this be referring to
student,whenever i use the make euchre command to compile my code compiles however when i use euchre packin shuffle 10 alice bob cathy drew i get a segmentation fault today is the first time that i have had this issue my code works as it is suppose to when i type in a nonsense name for the packfilename i ran gdb after compiling with g instead of o1 and the code stops working immediately after the line int mainint argc char arv and it says packin is not a core dump ive also tried reloading packin but it did not help what is going wrong
student,in our project for certain hands our jacks switch suit to the suit of the other color in our euchretest01out if its supposed to be a jack of hearts it is then a jack of diamonds in one case the last hand it even says the upcard is the jack of clubs instead of the jack of spades any idea on what could be wrong i especially dont see how the turned up card could be wrong
student,in the euchretest01outcorrect in hand 1 this is what is listed as the correct output hand 1 bob deals jack of spades turned up cathy passes drew passes alice passes bob passes cathy orders up clubs jack of hearts led by cathy king of hearts played by drew ace of hearts played by alice nine of spades played by bob alice takes the trick king of diamonds led by alice ace of diamonds played by bob nine of hearts played by cathy jack of diamonds played by drew bob takes the trick ten of spades led by bob ten of hearts played by cathy nine of diamonds played by drew queen of diamonds played by alice bob takes the trick jack of clubs led by bob ace of clubs played by cathy ten of diamonds played by drew ten of clubs played by alice bob takes the trick queen of clubs led by bob king of clubs played by cathy queen of hearts played by drew nine of clubs played by alice cathy takes the trick however because clubs is ordered up and bob is the dealer and the upcard is the jack of spades and bobs hand consists of the jack of clubs queen of clubs ace of diamonds 9 of spades and 10 of spades shouldnt bob pick up the jack of spades isnt it the left bower
student,so im creating more test output and i had a question if trump is hearts and a player has jack of diamonds left bower and the led suit is diamonds would the player play jack of diamonds as their highest card in the led suit or not
student,in this scenario where trump is hearts and led card is clubs and alice has queen of spades jack of spades ten of hearts ace of spades and king of spades which card does she play in my case she played queen of spades instead of jack of spades i am not sure why can someone please explain
student,do we need to have exact output with correct file does it means i need to print out the command line in my euchrecpp
student,so i was reading through the style guidelines and this question recently popped up that i just want to be absolutely sure for the overly complex functions where they suggested 50 lines where we should split our function into parts to make it more readable does the 50 lines also count comments
student,hey guys when i compile in caen linux i get this error gamecpp442 error control reaches end of nonvoid function bash41 at line 442 i have an end bracket to close out one of my helper functions why would it say that this is an error please help thanks
student,i am using the command listed in the spec to run the diff command and it gives me no output even when i changed the correct file just to see if it would show any output and it still does not even though it should because i changed one instance of bob to blobbbb this was the command i used euchre packin noshuffle 1 alice bob cathy drew euchretest00out diff ­q euchretest00out euchretest00outcorrect anyone else have this problem
student,this is what happens when i run diff on my project but cant find the difference
student,i ran make test and it worked i compared my results from euchretest00outcorrect to euchretest00out and euchretest01outcorrect to euchretest01out they both returned as correct and identical when i submit my make finaltar file to the autograder i get this running test cases running test cardtest00 pass running test packtest00 pass running test playertest00 pass running test euchretest00 compilation error running test euchretest01 compilation error running test cardtests compilation successful running test packtests compilation successful running test playertests compilation successful you passed 6 out of 8 test cases measuring 917 do you guys know whats wrong
student,does anyone know if this will work in the autograder because it would actually be so sick if we could implement this into our code
student,do we keep resetting the hand number after 5 or do we keep going until between 1 and 100 points is reached
student,do we need to account if the points to win gotten from the user is not an integer in euchrecpp say 55 and if so howdo we round the number
student,in other words if he has 5 trump cards in his hand that are better than the trump card he picks up does he then just keep his hand the same and not pick up the called up card this is how i understand the spec but this differs from the rules of euchre so i just wanted to clarify to make sure thanks
student,i passed all the checkpoint tests about initializing the pack and dealing cards on xcode but for some reason when i try to deal cards on linux terminal the code always starts dealing eights instead of nines and nines instead of tens etc i was wondering what may cause this shift of ranks
student,hey guys i had about 37 errors show up on valgrind turns out their documentation recommends turning off any optimization flags such as o1 that we use as they can throw up a lot of false negatives in my case after turning off the opt flag my errors were down to just four including a segfault the segfault wasnt showing up when i ran euchre in terminal turns out valgrind runs the program in a different environment good luck
student,for dealing the cards i used this 20 times in 3232 2323 order cardadded packdealonegameptrpack playeraddcardgameptrplayersplayernumber cardadded i then did it one more time for the upcard card upcard packdealonegameptrpack this all worked but when i try to call playeradddiscard for the dealer though in the case of the trump suit being ordered up in round 1 i get a seg fault here is my line if order up is in round one playeraddanddiscardgameptrplayersthedealer upcard it seg faults at this line and i have no idea why
student,does the autograder reset in the morning if i submit for the third time right now do i have to wait 24 hours or just wait until the morning
student,running through the autograder twice i get this print out both times running test cardtest00 pass running test packtest00 pass running test playertest00 pass running test euchretest00 pass running test euchretest01 pass running test cardtests compilation successful running test packtests compilation successful running test playertests compilation successful you passed 8 out of 8 test cases measuring 1717 are there no other tests like in project 2 to see if we are failing a different scenario for instance is there a cardtest01 or playertests01
student,is it ok to have 4 helper functions for gameplay one for trump deal shuffle and cardwinner check is that enough helper functions so that my gameplay function doesnt look like trash
student,if the compiler runs into a seg fault error when running the program does it not cout anything at all even if the cout is before the seg fault
student,for packinit should we make a test case where we input in the wrong filename i tried to do that the whole program exitfails and does not do the rest of the other test cases after it
student,so i get that strcpy is supposed to be used to put the names from the command line into playernames however to do this the elements of playernames must have a large enough size to contain the names would it be ok to accomplish this by going through each element of player names and saying playernamesi new char maxstrlen or would that count as using dynamic memory and therefore not be good style for this project if so how else can you make sure the arrays in playernames are large enough to contain the names
student,do we need to account for players having the same names like will there be a case with two people named alice or can we assume that all names will be unique
student,i think the results in euchretest01 has answered this question but im still asking to be sure if trump is hearts if lead card is king of hearts jack of diamonds and ten of hearts both follow the lead suit if lead card is ten of diamonds king of diamonds follow the lead jack of diamonds does not if lead card is jack of diamonds king of hearts follow the lead king of diamonds does not is that correct
student,do we need to submit additional test cases to test gamecpp and euchrecpp
student,when compiling with make euchre i get an error that says error opening 0 what does this mean im not finished with gamecpp only with euchrecpp could that be the issue
student,when submitting project3 to the autograder the results i get back include compliation errors for the following tests playertest00 euchretest00 euchretest01 cardtests playertests but when compiling and testing on the terminal with the commands on the project description it complies and i get passes for all the player and card tests and my euchre output is the same as the solution any suggestions on what could be causing the compilation errors
student,can an instructor please clarify what i should do in regard to writing rmes in the cpp file for functions that already have rmes in the h file this was asked in 1295 but not only has there not been an instructor response which would be preferable for an administrative question like this but the student responses conflict with one another which of the following is correct 1 copyandpaste the rmes from the h file into the cpp file 2 do not write an rme for the functions in the cpp file which have an rme in the h file 3 do something else none of the above
student,on the correct output files for testing euchrecpp the first line is the command line that youd place in the terminal is that expected to be printed onto the page
student,if the packin doesnt exist when you run the project what error message should we print in packcpp it says we should print open failed but in the spec it says we should print error opening pack file name
student,if we are using cout statements while debugging our code when we submit the final project should we comment them out or delete them altogether
student,ifplayermaketrumpgameptrpackplayerptr gameptrpacknext gameptrplayersplayernumber round gameptrpacknextsuit this line of code causes 3 of the same errors error base operand of has nonpointer type pack and i am not quite sure how to fix them or what is wrong any help is appreciated
student,i know its not sylytically favored to have too much code on one line so as a guideline what should be the maximum number of characters on one line max thanks
student,for playermaketrump function when calling it in my helper function for gameplay its the last argument but how am i suppose to access a suit with just game pointer
student,in the rmes i noticed in a few places it says stdout for the modifies clause does this just mean that something is printed during the function i have never really included these in my rmes is it necessary if i got the right meaning to the stdout phrase
student,so when the dealersay alice is making on the 1st roundnot the second since thatd be the screw the dealer scenario should she be considering the the up card to be in her hand since she will be getting the card if she orders it up
student,once a hand has been completed ie a team wins the majority of tricks and points are assigned what happens 0 assign points 1 print euchred or march 2 pack gets reset 3 call shuffle if shuffle has been specified in argv 4 deal cards again but who becomes the new dealer is it the player left of the old dealer
student,we have tested our output manually and using textcompare programs and our output is correct however when we use the diff function in terminal we seem to fail we are valgrind clean any idea what could be the reason why we are failing
student,will we be graded on our style in our test files
student,i wrote a test case to try and see if my screw the dealer function works properly i turned up a queen of diamonds and all of the players passed on the card as they were supposed to on the second round of making a player has the jack of diamonds in hand would he order up hearts in this scenario since its the left bower or would he pass does the left bower count as the opposite suited face card while making trump in the first or second round
student,assume a have ace of diamonds ace of spades jack of clubs nine of hearts king of clubs and the up card is ten of clubs now a has already make clubs as trump in round one so he has to take in the ten of clubs and drop one card will he replace nine of hearts to ten of clubs or some other card
student,my partner and i have passed all the autograder tests however when we try to make our own pack to test using a new file pack2in we get errors not in opening the file but in converting our strings rank and suit we run this using euchre pack2in shuffle 10 alice bob cathy drew if we copy and paste the same information into packin and use that to run our code it works is there a reason that we are unable to create a valid in file i am using sublime text 3 with putty is this something that we should be concerned about when submitting our project for a grade
student,can we assume that all four player names will be distinct
student,this might have been asked already but is it okay to include the published test cases with our own tests cases when we submit the final tar
student,this was in the published test cases packresetpack assertcardcomparefirstcard ninespades 0 im confused how this checks packreset as firstcard is initialized to the first card card firstcard packnext in the beginning and never changes as far as i can tell
student,i keep getting this error when trying to compile after writing code for the first tasks shapescpp text0x44 undefined reference to vtable for circle can anyone give me a clue to what this means
student,at some point in our code we have two jack of clubs for two different players when one shouldve had the jack of spades we think its because somehow we are mixing up the suits of the bowers and making the right bower the left bower any ideas on how or where we couldve done something like this we cant find it at all
student,for the dealing aspect im trying to call playeraddcard but the second argument requires a card am i allowed to create a pack pointer variable thus allowing me to access the first card of a deck because the pack in the player struct isnt a pointer so i cant directly use that for my argument can i hope that made sense
student,so im trying to get my deal function to work properly but when i try to do pack deal one it doesnt work properly im trying to debug it so im using card print to print out the next card to see what it is but i get addresses instead of the correct values i do initialize packptrnext in my init as packptrcards i dont understand what is going on
student,say for example player 1 has queen of hearts and jack of diamonds if its round two and the upcard is nine of hearts then would the player not order up because the jack of diamonds is not really a diamond anymore its a left bower so its techinically a heart is the left bower always considered to have the suit of the trump
student,when trying to set this in gameinit in one of the arguments you are given points to win how do you know which team that is for if one team had 4 the other 6 points the points to win are different for each
student,i have been running some simple diff tests and i recently have been getting some responses that say that just the command line inputs are different with a 0a1 signal above it i do not quite know why they are different as nothing in the output is different only the command line inputs but that should not matter output after diff test looks like this as an example with the given tests bash41 diff euchretest01out euchretest01outcorrect 0a1 euchre packin shuffle 10 alice bob cathy drew thanks in advance
student,what do you do if this is your code cout joehandsize endl assertjoehandsize 4 and this is the output 4 assertion joehandsize 4 failed aborted
student,how do you get the card suit in gamecpp for the purpose trying to determine you do declare trump based off of the card face up in card cardgetsuit requires the trump suit in the function call but i cant seem to get that thanks in advance
student,what must be the value of int argc 7 or 8 should i also count the argv0 the project name
student,the specs say players use a simple strategy that considers only the suit that was led does this mean that we just play the first card that is in the hand that is close to the lead suit or thanks
student,when i try to compile in g i get the following errors i dont know what any of them mean when i compile in visual studio 2013 i dont get any of these errors but i get unresolved external symbol errors it seems odd that it says uchrecpp rather than euchrecpp which leads me to believe i mistyped it somewhere but ive looked everywhere i can think and its spelled correctly
student,is this acceptable for project 3 will there be any lost style points and such there doesnt appear to be anything within the project spec nor the general style guidelines any and all comments are appreciated
student,is it bad style not to have a default case for a switch statement we use in our project and are unsure if a default case would work for it
student,i found a really helpful way to find out who wins a trick but it would be easier if i created a struct are we allowed to define our own structs also i went ahead and tried it and it works on my computer in visual studio but fails to even compile in linux would anyone know why
student,i have a couple of questions about valgrind when i run valgrind on my finished project i get the following message 10640 memcheck a memory error detector 10640 copyright c 20022012 and gnu gpld by julian seward et al 10640 using valgrind381 and libvex rerun with h for copyright info 10640 command euchre packin shuffle 10 alice bob cathy drew 10640 10640 10640 heap summary 10640 in use at exit 0 bytes in 0 blocks 10640 total heap usage 7 allocs 7 frees 8917 bytes allocated 10640 10640 all heap blocks were freed no leaks are possible 10640 10640 for counts of detected and suppressed errors rerun with v 10640 error summary 0 errors from 0 contexts suppressed 6 from 6 1 in the project spec the example code is compiled using g is this necessary or will valgrind work properly without it the reason i ask is because the default makefile does not use g 2 what does the output mean when it reads suppressed 6 from 6 are these errors also what does it mean by rerun with v when i type valgrind v command i get a huge wall of text that i dont understand
student,i am having trouble printing the line euchre packin noshuffle 1 alice bob cathy drew there is an extra space after drew and i dont know why my code isnt working it is not printing the extra space after drew my code is a simple for loop but in my euchretestout the extra space doesnt appear at the end for int i 0 i 8 i cout argvi what could be the problem ive already used the diff command and the first line printed was my only error
student,for project 3 we use a mix of iteration and pointer to navigate arrays is navigation by iteration something we will be docked points for just curious because of the focus on pointerscstrings for this project
student,i ran through my code in visual studios and everything turned out to be perfectly fine however running it through linux makes this error message pop up taking address of temporary ill do a quick example of the error message its pointing at card playedcard playerplaycardgameptrplayersleftdealer ledcard turnupsuit what do i do
student,my first 3 hands played in gamecpp work perfectly but when i enter the loop for the fourth time my program ends with a segmentation fault could it have something to do with indexing with gameptrpack
student,if a left bower is led is the trump suit used or the suit of the jack thanks
student,our playerleadcard function is passing most of the test cases but when i tried testing jack hearts jack diamonds ace hearts ten clubs nine hearts trump hearts its causing an error after i call the function the cards in players hand are jackdiamonds acehearts tenclubs ninehearts ninehearts so the first card gets discarded the last card is added so we end up having 2 ninehearts and the lead card doesnt get discarded from hand does anyone know what could possibly be causing this
student,is this which is part of the game struct supposed to be used in gameinit and if so for what reason
student,do we have shuffle the pack three times in game init if not what do we do with the shuffle in gameinit thanks
student,diff checker still gives us one difference when my partner and i run it we get the following message printed to us euchre packin noshuffle 1 alice bob cathy drew does this mean that our file contains this while the correct file does not and why is it being printed to our file if thats true thanks
student,quick questions for getting shuffle and player names from the arguments to main for shuffle i want to make a bool true if the argument is equal to shuffle and false otherwise would this be the correct way to do this if strcmpargv2 shuffle 0 bool shuffle true else bool shuffle false because im getting an error that says shuffle is unused which makes me think the function never gets into the if statement also for creating an array of player names from the arguments i tried doing this const char const playernames4 for int i 0 i 4 i playernamesi argvi4 and got an error saying i cant change a readonly location playernames how can i make an array and add names to it that has to be constant when its passed to gameinit
student,hi when i submit my finaltar to the autograder it passes all test cases but for euchre it shows the following could someone tell me what does it mean thanks running test euchretest00 warning your program exited with nonzero status pass running test euchretest01 warning your program exited with nonzero status pass
student,just wondering why if a game struct includes shuffle and pointstowin member variables then they are also passed as arguments to gameinit whats the purpose of this if theyre already within the gameptr argument
student,when my partner and i test the whole project we get identical output to euchretest01 and euchretest00 but are still failing it in the autograder we have used q flags in diff and have used valgrind both of which come up with no errors the outputs are identical a professor said that the autograder tests euchretest00 and euchretest01 the tests that we keep failing are only testing for the output that we have in the text files we were given what could be the problem
student,for the final submission do we need to have any of our own test cases for gamecpp and euchrecpp also if the test cases we wrote for cardcpp packcpp and playercpp passed the checkpoint tests does that mean we dont need to make any changes to them or add any additional test cases
student,if we wanted to make our own packin files and obviously name them something else and call them as input streams as part of packtestcpp will the submitted project still compile even though the input file will not be included in the final tar
student,when i run make test i get this compile error make test cardtests cardtestsout packtests packtestsout playertests playertestsout euchre packin noshuffle 1 alice bob cathy drew euchretest00out euchre cardcpp36 suit suitnextsuit assertion 0 failed binsh line 1 31103 aborted euchre packin noshuffle 1 alice bob cathy drew euchretest00out make test error 134 at line 36 of cardcpp is in the suitnext function that was given to us the line has assert0 on it with a comment saying it should never reach here
student,in euchre it also shows me with an error message gameptr unitialized i just declare gameptr in euchrecpp and initialized it with the gameini function in gamecpp it does not work does somebody knows the error
student,my project compiles in linux and i used diff to compare the output to euchretest00 and euchretest01 and the diff came back empty yet im still failing the autograder what could be causing this
student,when i run my euchre program i get a segfault error my euchrecpp ends like this gameinitargs gameplayarg cout ok at this point endl return 0 and the end of my output is ok at this point segmentation fault so it appears to me that there is some segfault occurring before my return 0 command which doesnt really make any sense to me
student,does anyone know how to pass in arguments in visual studio 2013
student,are we required to make test files for game and euchre
student,the way im attemping to deal involves setting a card equal to packaddone and then using that card for playeraddone however ive encountered an error where i get a segmentation fault if i try to cardprint the card i set equal to packaddone and i dont think theyre being dealt properly as well as if i try to cardprint the cards in the players hands in addition ive noticed that simply declaring another card before dealing in gamecpp and not using it for anything is somehow effecting what card comes up as the flipcard for the orderup rounds after the deal im sure this could be a wide variety of issues but im kindve clueless as to what i should even be looking for and id appreciate any ideas i could try thanks
student,when submitting to the autograder it says running tests cardtests running tests packtests running test playertests how are we being tested on these files
student,i have to print out the cards led and played but we cannot access cardh from game is there supposed to be another way to call the cardprint function or should we manually print them using cardsuit and cardrank
student,at the top of the correct outputs the first line is always the arguments passed into main such as this euchre packin shuffle 10 alice bob cathy drew are we supposed to include that in our output also or is that just to let us know which arguments they are using
student,i am trying to loop through the array of players i am trying to stop the function when the pointer points back to its original element is it ok to use a dowhile loop or i should always stick with forwhile loop and also is it ok to use break in a loop when i fulfill my condition
student,so i shuffled real cards in real world and alice have a of heart 9 of clubs jqk of diamond in the correct output providedwe have alice orders up diamonds ace of spades led by bob nine of hearts played by cathy queen of hearts played by drew ace of hearts played by alice bob takes the trick but i think based on the strategy alice should play the lowest non trump card which is 9 of clubs different from the correct output what is wrong
student,whats wrong with it
student,is it possible that euchretest00 works but euchretest01 doesnt even if packshuffle function is working fine
student,while running the code in gdb we keep encountering this error program received signal sigsegv segmentation fault 0x0000003119f3356f in strlensse42 from lib64libcso6 missing separate debuginfos use debuginfoinstall glibc2121132el654x8664 libgcc4474el6x8664 libstdc4474el6x8664 gdb bt 0 0x0000003119f3356f in strlensse42 from lib64libcso6 1 0x0000003123292ba1 in stdbasicostreamchar stdchartraitschar stdoperator stdchartraitschar stdbasicostreamchar stdchartraitschar char const from usrlib64libstdcso6 2 0x0000000000402be2 in cardprint cardptr0x7fffffffd130 at cardcpp49 3 0x0000000000401646 in leadandplay gameptr0x7fffffffd250 playerptr0x7fffffffe3d8 trumpdiamonds at gamecpp151 4 0x0000000000401d42 in gameplay gameptr0x7fffffffd250 at gamecpp266 5 0x000000000040100a in main argc8 argv0x7fffffffe4e8 at euchrecpp50 this seems to occur because of cardprint however we were provided this function so what exactly is the problem
student,do all helper functions have to be of type void
student,not sure if im going crazy or not but heres what happened yesterday i found a bug in my code involving a nine of spades in position 4 of the players hand somehow it was duplicating the card or something not exactly sure anyways i found it yesterday and just today i was looking at my code to try and fix itbut i think its not a problem anymore which has me really worried because does this mean its a bug that only shows up some of the time i gave it the exact same inputs as yesterday and it looks like its no longer an issue what does this mean
student,on page 4 of the spec we are given an example once cards are dealt alice will hold the cards jack of hearts queen of hearts ace of clubs nine of diamonds and ten of diamonds if the upcard is jack of diamonds in round one after everyone passes shouldnt alice be the one to order up according to the spec alice also passes though why is this
student,so im running the diff command to check the outputs and i get this as my output 26c26 queen of clubs played by drew queen of clubs played by drew i also tried adding the q as sugguested on another post but that just tells me my files differ i also checked for extra spaces so thats not the issue any ideas on why this is happening
student,1 if we have to shuffle the deck do we shuffle before we deal the first hand or do we deal the hand with the deck as is 2 is the player who leads card always the player left of dealer 3 will the upcard be the last card in the deck
student,in the spec it says eldest hand player at left of the dealer eg player 3 is left of player 2 and player 0 is left of player 3 thus the first command which has alice bob cathy and drew means p0 alice p3 bob p2 cathy p1 drew if so the order of playersi doesnt make for a nice for loop so should i do some sort of rearrangereinit of the players indexing
student,im running into a segmentation fault in gameplay debugging revealed that the problem lied in my helper fcn gameshuffle i simply entered in noshuffle to leave it out ran it and it worked ergo it works with an unshuffled deck so im a little confused that while my packshuffle fcn works and passes tests my gameshuffle helper fcn results in a segmentation fault when i implement it note i threw in a cardprint in gameplay gdb printed out cannot access memory at address 0x8003f5a00 however cardprint was successful in printing cards wunshuffled deck apologies for the lengthy post
student,hey guys when im compiling in caen i get this error tmpccdjbabio in function main euchrecpptext0x3f2 undefined reference to gameinitgame char const bool int char const const collect2 ld returned 1 exit status can someone explain what this means thanks
student,this may sound very dumb and even incomprehensible so bear with me ill come up with a quick scenario if player2 is dealing that means the first 3 cards are dealt to player1 then 2 cards to player0 and then to player3 if player2 is leading that means he plays a card then player3 plays next and then player0 plays next okay so you get my drift initially i thought everything would have been easy if we just looped the dealing and playing cards but then i came across the problem of transitioning from 3 to 0 and vice versa any advice in general on how we could think this through anything better than looping do i actually have to create 4 different if statements on how everything is dealt
student,im using the packdealone function and assigning it to a card and then am printing out the card and am getting a segmentation fault when i use card print but its not always occuring im calling packdealone and then card print numerous times and most of them work fine and print the card but occasionally the seg fault occurs and i cant figure out why this is
student,does player who leads card change each trick do we print the score after each trick or after each hand
student,im a bit confused at what is supposed to happen at the end of a hand the pack gets reset im sure but is it supposed to always reshuffle the deck or does it just depend on whether the argument passed in is shuffle or noshuffle
student,so when i make test on a caen linux machine g pedantic wall werror o1 cardtestscpp cardcpp o cardtests g pedantic wall werror o1 packtestscpp packcpp cardcpp o packtests g pedantic wall werror o1 playertestscpp playercpp packcpp cardcpp o playertests g pedantic wall werror o1 euchrecpp gamecpp playercpp packcpp cardcpp o euchre cardtests cardtestsout packtests packtestsout playertests playertestsout euchre packin noshuffle 1 alice bob cathy drew euchretest00out diff q euchretest00out euchretest00outcorrect euchre packin shuffle 10 alice bob cathy drew euchretest01out diff q euchretest01out euchretest01outcorrect however the autograder gives compilation error for playertest00 euchretest00 euchretest01 and playertests not sure what would cause everything to compile on the caen linux machine but not in the autograder any ideas
student,are we supposed to cout the outputs on gampcpp after calling gameplay do we need to have the exact same output as the file that was given to us thanks
student,so in euchretest00outcorrect and euchretest01outcorrect the first line is the command eg euchre packin shuffle 10 alice bob cathy drew so should we cout argv on run of our euchrecpp main function
student,im assuming that this function will only be used whenever a player orders up at the beginning of each hand if thats right is this function only supposed to do simple comparisons between cards or do we need to take the suit of the upcard in consideration as well
student,i was wondering for this test case of playerplayecard if the trump suit was diamonds and the ledcard was suit diamonds and drew had jack of hearts jack of diamonds and ten of diamonds what does he play can you explain why please
student,when testing our output vs the sample output the same card is flipped over and bob cathy and drew are all dealt the correct 5 cards but somehow alice is not being dealt the correct hand this essentially means it cant be a problem with shuffle or some other functions any idea howwhy this could be happening
student,just wondering is gameplay meant to finish a hand of game or the entire game until it reach the pointstowin
student,would the test cases run by the auto grader have misspelled card names for example kin of hearts would it have repeating cards in the packin how extensive do we need to worry about boundary cases
student,how do we pick the upcard do we deal 5 cards per player and use the 21st card as the upcard or do we just pick an upcard and then start dealing
student,i ask this in regards to playertestscpp packtestscpp and cardtestscpp i assume we do not have to submit test cases for gamecpp and euchrecpp although its obviously a good idea to develop them on our own is this assumption correct
student,just wanted to clarify everything that is due for the final submission 1 card cpp and card test 2 pack cpp and pack tests 3 player cpp and player tests 4 game cpp 5 euchre cpp 6 grouptxt also regarding test cases do we need to write test cases for the gameeuchre component or only for card pack and player as for card pack and player we were given test cases so do we need to write more and if so how many more i think i remember hearing that we need to write at least one more for each function in card pack and player is this correct what about for functions we created to help us with the actual game part finally on functions that we wrote that have a requires clause do we need to use assert to check that the user follows the requires clause or is this not necessary
student,how am i supposed to compare them for the error checking for the number of points to win and shuffle and noshuffle
student,just wondering can we create separate functions to test each game function within playertests packtests etc theres no int main statement in any of those files so thats why im wondering thanks
student,any help on how i can determine who made trump for scoring points
student,when i run the make game command in the terminal it tells me that none of the functions from any other files are defined but my gamecpp file includes the gameh file which includes the other files necessary why are these error messages appearing
student,like do we only assign all of the parameters and scores to 0 or do we deal cards do we make trump how far into the game does the game have to be initialized the rme seems to be vague
student,when i run make test there is no problem moving through ecuhretest00 however when it tries to run euchretest01 i get an error that reads recipe for target test failed thanks for any help
student,when would the deck ever reach screw the dealer since the dealer would order up on the second round anyway due to having at least one face card of the opposite suit in their hand
student,suppose a jack of clubs is turned up when making do the players search their hands for only club face cards or do they search for spade face cards too i guess my question is can someone order up spades during the first round if a club is turned up
student,when i run this it spits out g pedantic wall werror o1 cardtestscpp cardcpp o cardtests g pedantic wall werror o1 packtestscpp packcpp cardcpp o packtests g pedantic wall werror o1 playertestscpp playercpp packcpp cardcpp o playertests cardtests cardtestsout packtests packtestsout make test error 1 what is that error
student,regarding the newest announcement on ctools the correct command for compiling playertests is as follows g pedantic wall werror o1 playertestscpp playercpp cardcpp o playertests we will not be compiling packcpp with your player tests if you find yourself wanting to use pack to test player you should rethink your testing strategy my questions 1 i dont understand the announcement can somebody clarify 2 are we supposed to submit something other than the finalsubmittargz 3 all i did was punch in make finaltar as it said in the specifications is this okay or should i submit something else 4 are we being graded on how well our test cases find bugs like in eecs 183 thanks for all and any help
student,when we tested with different points to win with shuffle true all the results are in the ratio of 12 is this correct for example points to win 10 partnership1 5 partnership2 10 points to win 98 partnership1 49 partnership2 98
student,couldnt find if an answers been posted but i have work during professor mihalcea and professor essls office hours is there another way i could get my exam back thanks
student,
student,for a test case where the upcard is an ace of spades and everyone passes in round one if the only club in a players hand is the jack of clubs in round 2 will they order up clubs
student,im running code in caen now and not passing euchretest00 but when i check my output and the correct output in a diff checker it says they are identical ive checked possible whitespace issues so i dont know what else could be throwing it off just to clarify should there be a newline printed after the game winners are announced even so ive tried it with and without newlines there any ideas on what could be causing it to fail
student,when trying to pass make test to the command line the terminal wont compile it and instead says euchre permission denied not sure whats going on
student,on the first trick of the first hand is it always the person to the left of the dealer that leads or is it dependent on who orders up
student,if trump is diamonds and the eldest hand contains the q k a of spades and the 10 j of clubs what does he lead with is the 10 of clubs considered greater than ace of spades per the order of suits in the spec
student,in gamecpp after we identify a dealer and make a call to a gamedeal helper function are we supposed to use packdealone to pull cards from the pack or should we use playeraddcard to add cards to each players hand do we use both
student,google calendar shows that this time should be someones office hour we have bee here waiting for him for about half hour is this oh cancled
student,so i have a specific variable that keeps track of which player made trump and i use that later to compare it to the partners in the partnerships to figure out who won the round and what to print based of off that im getting an error that says no match for the operator i tried dereferencing the pointer that points to the player so that im only comparing addresses but im stilling getting the same error any suggestions
student,i remember professor deorio saying that we should test a stacked deck what does this exactly mean because according to the spec the pack will always be 24 cards and those cards will be unique thanks
student,ive already completed lab 6 and am getting the correct response but in order to receive full credit i reviewed the spec to make sure im answering everything accurately so in lab 6 under task 3 it states the second change you need to make for this task is to write implementations for these two member functions in bold i was wondering what the first change for task 3 was because it wasnt as clearly defined as the second change
student,jack of spades led by bob king of spades played by cathy ace of spades played by drew nine of diamonds played by alice drew takes the trick im a little confused as to why cathy played king of spades she has a jack of clubs which is the left bower so why doesnt she play that instead i seem to be misunderstanding the rules of the game ill share what my understanding of the rules are if bob is leading with a jack of spades then spades becomes like a temporary trump at the end of this round since jack of spades is the right bower bob should take the trick obviously this is wrong can someone clarify how to determine which cards to play and which cards take the trick
student,hi i have been trying to make a constructor using the initializer list concept and keep getting errors i have been looking at this for 2 hours now my code is very much analogous to the examples given in class and there seem to be scarce examples of this concept online esp initializer lists w structs i have checked for accidental typos and that is not the culprit and though it is telling me that the protypes dont match it definitely appears they do these are the errors i get lab06cpp45 error expected ‘’ before ‘’ token lab06cpp45 error prototype for ‘projectileprojectilepoint2d double’ does not match any in class ‘projectile’ lab06h26 error candidates are projectileprojectileconst projectile lab06h47 error projectileprojectilepoint2d double double lab06cpp38 error projectileprojectile lab06cpp45 error expected initializer before ‘’ token what might errors of this type indicate any help would be appreciated thank you
student,after each hand over we need to print the sequence of playerss name and their current points but is there are any rule i can follow should i print the winner partnership of the latest hand first in each partnership which player i should print first
student,hello all as i am writing gamecpp i cant help but think about what is happening to the pack as we play through each round until someone reaches the winning score my thought is that in a real game the pack would be reordered in the order of all the discards is this happening or is the dealer just rotating and the the pack being reshuffled from the same order it was the round before
student,i am done with project 3 however i did not make any helper functions and all my code for the bulk of gamecpp is inside the gameplay function is it important to make helper functions so the code looks more organized
student,im trying to write a function that says this team made trump any advice i could use i know what trump suit is made just im struggling with how i can find what team made it
student,what is the difference between the constructor declaration and implementation i cant find the precise difference in the lecture notes
student,we have created and tested our game helper functions and created a separate file called gametestscpp do we turn this in during submission or do we only turn in test cases for card player and pack
student,are euchretest00outcorrect and euchretest01outcorrect the output for the final published autograder tests my output for my code is the same as these two but its still failing the two autograder tests
student,my partner and i have run into a bit of an issue regarding the interpretation of the playcard strategy bottom of page 3 in the pdf the specification says to consider only the suit that was lead play the highest card that follows the leads suit or otherwise play your lowest overall card according to my understanding that means that someone would never play a trump card unless the trump was the lowest card in their hand why doesnt the strategy consider trump card
student,im trying to traverse through the argv array and keep getting an error in terminal cannot convert ‘const char’ to ‘char’ in initialization is terminal telling me that argv is a double pointer
student,im trying to cout something in a function and when i do it outputs a box that looks like this 00 01 why is this
student,in the dos and donts section of the project 3 spec it reads do pass by const pointer when appropriate dont i dont think ill modify it does this refer to passing arguments of the form const t ptr or does it refer to t const ptr any clarification would be appreciated
student,so while playing a trick the left bowers suit is no longer considered its own but rather the trump suit for example if trump were diamonds and lead card was ace of hearts then one would play their king of hearts instead of their jack of hearts because the jack of hearts is no longer jack of hearts but functionally considered to be jack of diamonds
student,so i get the correct output for test00 but diff said that they didnt match after i read through it line by line to make sure our output was correct then i used kompare to see if that would help and the only difference that i saw was that at the end of each line of the test00 correct output there is a little symbol that looks like a music note whereas our output does not have this any idea of what that symbol means
student,i apologize if this is a repeat question but is it true that we can go to either professor mihalcea or professor essls office hours to pick up our exam or are the exams separated alphabetically or by section thanks
student,hi all im just wondering what types of things youve been testing beyond the published test cases for euchretest00 and euchretest01 ive been testing my cardplayerpack functions in a little more depth but im still not entirely sure how i can make sure that the full euchre program is working appropriately also how would you write test cases for this since it is mostly requiring you to check the output given whatever command line prompt you use thank you in advance for any suggestions
student,for project 3 do i need to write an rme in the cpp file for function that already has an rme in its corresponding h file
student,im having some trouble using the string to integer function i need a way to convert argv into an int for the number of points to win i use the stoi function like in lecture but the autograder says it cant find the function is there a different way to convert a cstring to an int besides using stoi
student,hi im ahving trouble understanding why alice doesnt keep the jack of diamonds after its turned up and bob orders up hearts do we not consider suit of the upcard when we add or discard the cards for the dealer
student,so weve technically passed test00 the terminal keeps saying that our output file doesnt match with the test output file however i have checked it line by line and everything is identical are their trailing single spaces for each line or something
student,in the instructions it says a possible helper function to add in gamecpp would be gameshuffle but why would we need to create a helper function that would shuffle the pack the same way as in packshuffle
student,whenever i try to print the suit it just prints the number how do i make it print the actual suit name
student,when we debug with gdb is there a way to put in a break after a certain number of iterations of a loop like lets say i have forint i 0 i 5 1 that spans between lines 150 of my code and i want to put a break at line 20 after i is 2 how would do that break gamecpp 20 would break during the first iteration of that loop meaning when i is 0
student,so i made a helper function to shuffleor not shuffle and then deal out the cards to each player what is the best way to go about this is there anyway to use the playeraddcard function because when i tried using it it gave me a compile error something about temporary memory so i just used the playerdealone function but this means i have to manually set my handsize to 5…is this okay we can assume the hand size will always be 5 for every playerright thanks
student,does the autograder have more detailed or just more tests for player pack and card for the final submission are there any published tests for the final submission
student,there is no audio on the video or the mp3 it is completely silent
student,if its round 2 of making trump i know the player has to have a face card that is of the same color of the suit of the upcard but does it also count if its the same suit as the upcard for example if the upcard was hearts and the player has a jack of hearts would this be considered as enough to make trump or does it have to be a face card of the suit diamonds thanks
student,my midterm grade hasnt been posted and judging from the comments on the average scores it seems most have is this abnormal
student,i finished my code and when i run it i seem to get exactly the same output but when i run the tests or submit to the autograder i fail both im having trouble finding where my output differs from the correct is there any way to get diff to show me where exactly the difference is
student,is it safe to say that the hand number is equal to the index of the dealer so if we are on hand number 1 the second player player at index 1 is the dealer thanks
student,if there is a mistake in the input should i have euchre packin shuffle 10 alice bob cathy drew or the inputs because they will be different if there was a mistake print before i print usage euchre packfilename shufflenoshuffle pointstowin name1 name2 name3 name4 or should the first statement not print at all
student,there are 2 pdf files uploaded on resources for lecture 12 one is called polymorphism and the other polymorphismconflict which one should we use any ideas
student,hand 0 alice deals ace of diamonds turned up bob passes cathy passes drew passes alice orders up diamonds ace of spades led by bob nine of hearts played by cathy queen of hearts played by drew ace of hearts played by alice bob takes the trick can someone explain to me why bob takes the trick isnt the ace of hearts greater than ace of spades if the trump suit is diamonds
student,im failing both on local linux and in the autograder im wondering if this is because the euchretest00outcorrect file has the command line arguments at the top and my out files do not or if something else is going on when i open up my out files and run the text against the text in the outcorrect files on diffcheckercom i get the message that the two files are identical im not including the command line arguments when i copy the outcorrect files on diffcheckercom are we supposed to remove the top line on the outcorrect files before using the makefile test orrrrr am i maybe failing the autograder because my finalsubmit tar doesnt have any out outcorrect files
student,so the specifications state 1 the complete ordering of all the cards is all trump cards including left bower the aces of the remaining three suits follow in suit order the remaining kings in suit order and finally the remaining nines in suit order 2 if a player can follow suit he plays the highest card that follows suit otherwise he plays the lowest card in his hand the first trick in euchretest01outcorrect does not appear to follow this rule the file reads hand 0 alice deals ace of diamonds turned up bob passes cathy passes drew passes alice orders up diamonds ace of spades led by bob nine of hearts played by cathy queen of hearts played by drew ace of hearts played by alice bob takes the trick why does alice play the ace of hearts and not the nine of clubs she doesnt have any cards that follow suit spades and aces are supposed to be higher than nines regardless of suit order moreover neither the ace of hearts nor the nine of clubs is a trump card so they should be compared solely based on rank according to the cards i have shuffled by hand and dealt according to the specifications alice has the ace of hearts nine of clubs and jackqueenking of diamonds given that everyone elses cards played in the euchretest00outcorrect file matched my output and my output has matched this outcorrect file up until this point i am fairly confident this is a cardcompare issue but i dont know why my solution is incorrect
student,hand 1 bob deals jack of spades turned up cathy passes drew passes alice passes bob passes cathy orders up clubs jack of hearts led by cathy king of hearts played by drew ace of hearts played by alice nine of spades played by bob alice takes the trick king of diamonds led by alice ace of diamonds played by bob nine of hearts played by cathy jack of diamonds played by drew bob takes the trick ten of spades led by bob ten of hearts played by cathy nine of diamonds played by drew queen of diamonds played by alice bob takes the trick jack of clubs led by bob ace of clubs played by cathy ten of diamonds played by drew ten of clubs played by alice bob takes the trick queen of clubs led by bob king of clubs played by cathy queen of hearts played by drew nine of clubs played by alice cathy takes the trick bob and drew win the hand euchred alice and cathy have 1 points shouldnt alice and cathy have 0 points bob and drew have 2 points this is taken from the euchretest01outcorrect file and my question is shouldnt cathy and alice have 0 points instead of 1 since the side that made trump wins 1 point for 3 or 4 tricks and 2 points for taking all 5 and alice and cathy only took 2 tricks by that logic they should have 0 point
student,i passed euchre00 and euchre01 locally on my caen account however i failed both in the autograder are the published test cases different from the autograder test cases
student,for dealing the cards can we assume player0 will always be the one dealing at the beginning so that means player1 would be the first one to get cards thanks
student,i have a strange error in my code ive been debugging for hours and i cant seem to figure out what the problem is im using this argument euchre packin noshuffle 1 alice bob cathy drew in euchrecpp i call gameinitgameptr argv1 shuffle argv3 argv for some reason argv3 49 even though its 1 in my argument line my euchre game runs 49 hands because it thinks the pointstowin 49 i tried creating an int variable and setting it equal to argv3 and putting that in gameinit but it doesnt change anything as it shouldnt i know its not a bug somewhere else in my code because when i cout argv3 in euchrecpp it outputs 49 can anyone help sorry that this is so weird and specific but its driving me crazy and i have no idea what to do from here
student,im writing gamecpp with a helper function playhand i put a cout statement right before this function which printed and a cout statement as the first line of the playhand function which did not print when the program was run the program stopped at the cout statement right before playhand i triple checked and playhand seems to have the correct arguments for the function we wrote what could this be caused by how do i make sure the function is being called my cpu usage is around 100 and i have 2 gb of memory if this is the problem then how do i fix it
student,does euchrecpp itself check if the packin file is opened correctly
student,would it be advisable to create a structure in order to keep track of numbers of tricks taken by each team as well as if each team set trump or not
student,i want to make a function which moves to the next player and we arent allowed to modify the struct is there any way to do this without passing in the index of the player we are at in a parameter
student,every time i put in packtests it says error opening packin does anyone knows what this means i already input make packtests also
student,trying to initiate my pack for gameinit and got this error message bash41 g pedantic wall werror o1 euchrecpp gamecpp playercpp packcpp cardcpp o euchre usrlibgccx8664redhatlinux447lib64crt1o in function start text0x20 undefined reference to main collect2 ld returned 1 exit status
student,for pack in it i know we are suppose to assume the cards are formatted correctly but will we get points off if we still do additional checks in our code such as if the number of cards is larger than the pack size
student,does anyone know where in the ugli basement the oh tutoring is are we supposed to sign up anywhere im at the computers bit i dont see anyone
student,why doesnt this work cout gameptrplayers0 can someone point me in the right direction on how to do this correctly
student,are we allowed to add member variables in the game struct if we are is it possible to make a variable that is only in the scope of gamecpp
student,so the game structure contains an array of ints to keep track of the scores of the 2 partnerships it is acceptable to use my own variables instead of using this part of game structure
student,if we create a cpp file named gametestscpp and we are not allowed to change gameh due to procedure abstraction do we includegamecpp to test our helper functions isnt our helper functions written as static functions so they wont be accessed outside of gamecpp can anyone illuminate me a proper way of testing our helper functions
student,in task 2 we are told to use an initializer list i missed this before so i believe i wrote a version without using one which seems to work my question then is how and why are we supposed to use an initializer list in this context
student,anyone know a reason why my gamecpp says unknown type game even when i include gameh and all of the other h files
student,do we need to have test cases for any helper functions we create for game
student,when is the last day to drop this class
student,which index of playersnumplayers are we initializing with playernames
student,can i have an instructor response on the confusion of 1223 im still wondering if the modify on stdout is a typo or not on gameinit
student,when i tested playermaketrump in playertests all my test cases passed however when i call playermaketrump in my gamecpp file the function fails miserably i have no idea what to do from here
student,im calling this to have the dealer add and discard a card if trump is ordered up in the first round but im confused about 1 thing if the upcard is actually worse than any card in the dealers current hand do we still add it to the hand and discard the lowest of the original hand or do we discard the upcard
student,do we have to check if the pack was opened successfully in euchrecpp or another file
student,which website does everyone recommend for cstech related news all inputs are appreciated
student,for final submission is it acceptable to use portions of the published test cases for cardtests packtests and playertests is it necessary that we supplement these tests with our own test cases thanks
student,i know we are supposed to initialize everything for the game but i am a little confused on what we are supposed to initialize bool shuffle with do we just initialize that to true or false i am really not sure
student,hi guys i am working locally on a ubuntu machine after i add the test cases in the provided test file to my own test cases and when i tested my playerstestscpp it compiles and shows playertests pass but after that it shows stack smashing detected and the program is terminated what is wrong with this
student,after a handround of playing is completed and points for a team have been scored should we shuffle the pack using the previous packs card order ie after shuffling the pack 3x for the first round the packs card order for the 2nd round will be 3x shuffle the pack order that was used for the first round also for noshuffle wouldnt the same team win the round everytime because everyone will have the same hand thanks
student,i have passed all of the labs so far but only earned 512 for my lab grade in ctools why
student,do we need to put any code in the main function of gamecpp
student,i have a question about the playing order according to the project spec the rule for playing was if a player can follow suit he plays the highest card that follows suit otherwise he plays the lowest card in his hand but in the file euchretest00outcorrect why would the player cathy play nine of clubs and ten of clubs before the queen of spades isnt clubs superior to spades and also why would cathy not play the queen of spades instead of jack of spades when drew led with the king of clubs jack of spades led by bob king of spades played by cathy ace of spades played by drew nine of diamonds played by alice drew takes the trick king of clubs led by drew ace of clubs played by alice nine of spades played by bob jack of clubs played by cathy alice takes the trick ten of diamonds led by alice ten of spades played by bob nine of clubs played by cathy queen of clubs played by drew alice takes the trick jack of hearts led by alice ace of hearts played by bob ten of clubs played by cathy ten of hearts played by drew alice takes the trick queen of hearts led by alice king of hearts played by bob queen of spades played by cathy nine of hearts played by drew bob takes the trick
student,i realize that the class is curved as a whole at the end and the statistics of grades weve received so far are pinned in piazza however id like to know a little more can you give us examples of how the class was curved before and whether its even curved if the median is in the 80s range ie what percentage in the class meant a b what percentage in the class meant an a etc in previous semesters thank you
student,will the midterm be curved
student,when i submit to the autograder i pass all the tests except for the last one i keep getting compilation error for playertests i dont understand whats wrong everything works on caen linux environment just to be extra safe ive redownloaded the exact files that the autograder checks by downloading the submissionfile from my email then i extract the files directly into the download folder while still in my downloads folder of the caen computer and without altering the files in any way i run the following command g pedantic wall werror o1 packtestscpp packcpp cardcpp o packtests and everything compiles perfectly the autograder compiler must be different from the compilers of the caen environments in some way am i missing something everytime i declare i variable i initialize it immediately afterwards what could be the discrepancy between the autograder compiler and the compilers in caen linux environment
student,i just switched to computer science and dont have any experience on my resume pertaining to this field besides taking eecs 183 and this class i have no other experience how can i market myself to employers for internships without having any experience besides class work thanks
student,i have a question about the answers given to us in the text file euchretest01outcorrect in hand 0 in the third trick and fourth trick jack of diamonds led by alice ten of clubs played by bob queen of clubs played by cathy jack of hearts played by drew alice takes the trick ace of diamonds led by alice jack of clubs played by bob king of clubs played by cathy ten of diamonds played by drew alice takes the trick in both tricks diamonds is the led suit in the 3rd trick drew plays a heart but in the 4th trick he plays a diamond shouldnt he have played a diamond in the 3rd trick since he could have followed suit again the above output was taken from euchretest01correct i apologize if this has already been answered but i couldnt find anything through the search field on pizza
student,gameptrplayersname0playernames0 the complier shows an error about type mismatch i donot know the error and how to change it
student,for our static helper functions in gamecpp are we allowed to have them modify stdout andor return stuff to the function calling them or do static helper functions need to be fully hidden ie cannot print to stdout or return a card to the function calling it
student,modifies gameptr stdout void gameinit so in the specs it says that gameinit modifies stdout but in what way gameinit doesnt need to print anything to cout right thank you
student,i still have not gotten scores for project 1 ive only gotten the initial autograder results but nothing for style and everything else when will they be up on ctools
student,has the distribution of scores for project 2 been released yet
student,is it possible that the player has identical cards in his hand while playingcould this be one of the test cases im not too sure because it says we can assume the pack using to initialize the cards is well formed thanks
student,if both occur we print march first and then euchre yes
student,when the dealer is reached in the second round of making trump what should we output if the dealers cards imply that he should pass should we say he passes and just envoke screw the dealer or just say that he ordered up no matter what his cards are
student,to ensure im not going crazy in addition to being ordered by rank cards are also ordered by suit diamonds first then clubs hearts and spades this means that if trump was clubs and the cards being compared was a 9 of spades and 9 of diamonds the 9 of spades would be larger
student,for my gamecpp and euchrecpp my code compiles and executes properly in linux however in the autograder i got compilation errors for the euchretest0 and euchretest1 test cases what could be causing this
student,i was wondering are there any good software to use that lets us code together with other people we know eecs280 partner sometimes during the week we cant meet so i think a better way is to use a software that lets use share code and code together i was told about github but i heard it displays all of our code publicly which seems dangerous to do if we are not allowed to use github are there any other ways
student,have no idea how to open this submissionfile file in the email any help
student,would somebody please give a hint on how to run euchrecpp on xcode do i necessarily have to tested on linux or there is a way to do it in an ide i hope this question is not too obvious thank you
student,i read the spec and could not find an instance saying that all players will have unique names do we need to worry if two players have the same name
student,i see we have a command to run diff with the correct output and our own make test it also says to add more my question is where should those be added should we make a gametestscpp or euchretestscpp file and can i edit the makefile to add those tests to make the reason is i want to test my gameinit function thanks
student,im assuming we should call packdealone in our function that deals cards to the players in the 3232 2323 fashion described in the specs even though the packdealone fxn increments the next pointer how is it okay that it keeps the dealt card in the pack if we are to call this function to deal cards dont we also need to discard the dealt card from the pack do we then need to write our own function to discard cards from pack
student,can i assume that an initlialized cardnon empty card is always passed to playeraddinput also does it matter if i add new cards to the front or back of hand
student,gamecpp in function u2018void gameplaygameu2019 gamecpp134 error void value not ignored as it ought to be cardprintgameptrplayers0hand0 endl i get that error when i try to print the card in player0s hand this is done because when i make the players play cards the card played by player 0 is a two of spades which is a bug
student,in gameh gameinit is defined as void gameinit game gameptr const char packfilename bool shuffle int pointstowin const char const playernames are we supposed to change it to void gameinit game gameptr const char packfilename bool shuffle int pointstowin const char const playernames thanks
student,in the project spec it says that euchrecpp should read the command line arguments check them for errors and then print them could someone explain what this means please thanks
student,the last parameter that gameinit takes is an array const char const playernames but there is no array of player names in the spec it tells us to in main only check for the specified errors cout any errors if any and then call gameinit and gameplay however since there is no array or player names how can we call gameinit are we supposed to create our own array within main and assign each argv element accordingly then put that in our call to gameinit additionally are we supposed to do something similar for the bool shuffle as in do we create an arbitrary bool variable and use strcmp to determine whether it wants shuffle or noshuffle and use that to call in gameinit
student,hand 1 bob deals jack of spades turned up cathy passes drew passes alice passes bob passes cathy orders up clubs does this mean everybody passed and screw the dealer was invoked if that is the case why isnt the dealer bob ordering up the clubs
student,i just got a file from the autograder submissionfile from the p3 checkpoint with no accompanying text normally when i get an email with my submission it has some text about what test cases i passed style comments etc was i supposed to get style and test case comments
student,as the title suggests im getting a compilation error from the autograder when running test playertests its the very last test the autograder does im passing all other tests before it i also tried running the makefile for my playertests on a caen environment as opposed to local but i passed that then i ran the makefile for test on the caen environment and that ran successfully too sowhat do
student,so lets say the number of points required for one team to win the game is 20 we go through 5 rounds and one team has gotten all 5 tricks so they get 2 points are we supposed to reset the pack and reshuffle it if we do this we will get the same results
student,is there a way to run gdb while passing in arguments ie running euchre packin shuffle 10 alice bob cathy drew euchretest01out and being able to debug with gdb
student,after writing the gameinit function i am trying to call it in main i made a new game called gameptr and when i pass gameptr into the first argument in gameinit it is telling me that gameptr is uninitialized in this function isnt that the whole point of the function
student,do we have to write test cases for functions that were implemented for us
student,for our pack inputs like packin is it okay to assume that all files will have inputs of 24 cards or should we make checks for situations where this does not follow
student,why would we need a shuffling function in gamecpp didnt we already create one inside of packcpp
student,how do i initialize the players inside of the char array i cant iterate of the array because there is no number of players and i cant modify the players inside the array because they are of type const char const thanks
student,hi ive been using vs 2013 pro as the debugger and i have been having an issue with the ide that i could not seem to resolve here is the one and only error that i keep getting when i try to compile my project 1msvcrtdlibcrtexeobj error lnk2019 unresolved external symbol main referenced in function tmaincrtstartup i searched on google and many people suggested that changing the linker system settings i followed the answer that many people gave on numerous online forums they all basically point to the same solution but it just wouldnt solve the problem is anybody here a pro at visual studion and is willing to take a look into this particular issue for me thank you
student,so as i was looking over my code from before checkpoint 3 i realized that i probably should not be using cardgetsuit in playermaketrump because trump has not been made yet my question is should i be using cardgetsuit and make the upcardsuit as the trump parameter or just use upcardsuit to compare the suits the reason why i ask is because professor deorio was mentioning at office hours how there are two functions in which we cannot use cardgetsuit but i forgot which any ideas
student,at the beginning of euchrecpp it says in the spec that we must check argc and argv for errors what other errors would could we check for besides making sure that they passed in the correct number of command line arguments do we need to check if the elements in passed in are well formed cstrings as well
student,i believe this was mentioned in lecture before but i just dont remember isnt lab 6 due next week on friday rather than tomorrow on friday thanks
student,i may be confusing this with another assignment weve previously had but are we only allowed to use traversal by pointer for project three or can we use traversal by index as well
student,
student,for testing i am trying to write my own test cases by initializing players and then adding cards to their hand so i can leadcard and playcard and such but im having trouble initializing these variables because i try to do it like it is done in the tests cases written for us but these are not pointers so i cannot pass them into the functions so then when i try to make them pointers when i say for instance player john playerinitjohn john my compiler says there is an error in the second line because john may be used uninitialized in this function how can i set up a test case where this wont happen
student,are we allowed to create our own classes for this project also can we include our own header files with the classes inside them
student,hi gsis and ias got any tips for us youngsters regarding phone interviews thanks in advance
student,this is my code so far does this look correct int i 0 whilepquotesitime t i int spot i forint i i1 i psize i if pquotesspotprice pquotesiprice spot i return pquotesspot
student,for the function pointer declaration in this problem typedef void chickenint int what does the typedef mean in this statement
student,reading through the instructions for 5a it looks like we have to somehow access the time integer in the quote struct using the pricebook struct i understand how doing something like pquotesi can get you the quote at i but how would you access information in that quote time price through calling it with the pricebook like could you do pquotesitime
student,will they be on the midterm they were not covered on any of the practice exams or the exam review lecture
student,my code so far looks like this if filtertreeelttree return treemake else treelefttree treefiltertreelefttree treerighttree treefiltertreerighttree return tree is this correct
student,every past exam seems to have used typedefs but i dont remember learning typedefs in this semester will they be on this exam please help me
student,can we use a helper function for this problem
student,so i know how to use findkey to get the first instance of img in doc but i dont know how to start the pointer there to use findkey again to get the next instance of how can i call printstr starting at the first instance of img instead of the beginning of doc
student,having trouble with f4 f3 p returns 15 14 13 12 11 10 i think because it takes the pointer value starting at the 16 spot and ending at the 11 spot and then returns the value minus 1 f4 couts p and im not sure what that means does that mean it couts p and then you increment the pointer by 1 afterward but then the for loop also increments it again or is it the same thing as f3
student,what is the point of using the scope resolution operator to define a member function if it is already being defined inside the class
student,will we be provided with scrap paper for the exam im guessing were not allowed to bring our own since they may be confused as extra cheat sheets
student,im pretty lost on this problem anyone mind explaining how to do it
student,as in number 1g part b on the winter practice exam is it still tail recursive if it returns based on the truth value of a conditional statement the line before thanks
student,for problem 1b on w14 i got the concatenate to work when i run it in c using foo as dst and bar as src i get foobar but i also get a huge seg fault error while couting this is my int main int main char foo foo char bar bar strcatfoo bar int i 0 while foo cout fooi i return 0 the program prints foobar and then seg faults at the cout line not sure why
student,can someone explain to me what the pointer p means
student,void parsechar doc whiledoc char key 6 img if findkeydoc key 0 return const char start findkeydoc key char endkey6 const char end findkeydocendkey printstrstartend that is my code for problem 3 on winter 14 exam can someone please help me and let me know if this is okay on lobster it is saying that im not allowed to do if findkeydoc key 0…its ays you cant convert from a char to a bool but i dont get whyim very confused why its not working please help
student,i thought going over past labs would be helpful for preparing for the exam could soemone explain how to implement the following function requires row points to an array with at least size elements effects the order of elements in row is reversed for example 0110111101 would become 1011110110 void fliphorizontalint row int size task 2 your code here
student,when you do p dont you decrease the pointer first and then take the value so shouldnt 15 14 13 12 11 be printed instead of 16 15 14 13 12 11
student,where can we check our cumulative grade and specific grades
student,when calling canuseset for catchpokemon why do we use an ampersand for ash canuseset ashpokeballsetsi
student,if i create a pointer to an instance of a class adn want to access a member function would i use the tool ex class rectangle contains area function if i delcare rectangle r1 and want to use area function would i write r1area
student,i was working through the w14 midterm q 3 image tags and wanted to clarify somethings when findkey returns a pointer how does it do it will you have something like const char findkeyconst char doc const char key return doc also during the review session vidal assigned the pointer return a couple of different ways void parse const char doc const char a findkeydoc img const char b findkeya a findkeyb img i understand what the code does but shouldnt the second assignment to a be written as a findkeyb img why is it a findkeyb img just needed some clarification thanks
student,can we write out full code from previous exams and our projects anything goes if its a doublesidednormalsized piece of paper with our name on it thanks
student,for anyone whos interested my friend nick and i will be studying for the exam in pierpont for the next few hours or so anyone who wants to join is more than welcome
student,i cant find them on ctools
student,for treet chop i can not figure out how to visit each element in the tree without a helper function and i also can not figure out how to return the trimmed tree can anybody give me some pointers no pun intended
student,in the replace function does end start evaluate to the difference in the number of characters between them
student,for example if there was a cstring spam and char start came before char end in the cstring will start end evaluate to true
student,in problem 3 when i typed const char a findkeydoc img in labster it shows that semantic errors detected cannot convert string to char in function call parameter what shall i change thanks
student,i accidentally started writing all of the stuff i wanted to use as a cheat sheet on a 3x5 note card but i then realized that i could use a normal sheet of paper would it be a bad idea to bring the note card and fill out only one side of a normal sheet of paper
student,for question 2d in spring we have to update older so its fruits array is the same as newers by using pointer traversal or loop should i assume that both basketnumfruits has the same value thanks
student,for the array a i have two different responses 3 2 3 and 1 3 3 the former pointers are pass by value thus any changes to where b is pointing to when passed through helper shouldnt reflect any changes to where it points to in main the latter i simply follow the operations of helper when its called
student,can anybody explain all of the ptr ptr etc what are the differences in the two above and maybe more similar statements i know roughly what they do but what would be a very concise clear explanation of what they do
student,if asked to use traversal by pointer is it illegal to use anything with the format ptr i for any reason or would one be allowed to use such a statement outside the body of the loop which governed the traversal for instance for something like problem 2b in the spring midterm assuming that problem specified that you were to use traversal by pointer would it be legal to use a statement like fruits numfruits i within the loop for string i fruits i fruits numfruits i
student,for this question im pretty sure that the array is supposed to exclude eggplant for the last element because oldernumfruits actually updates to 4 but with the code i have eggplant is still printing is the following code correct and im just thinking about it wrong or is something wrong with the code that is causing the wrong input void newupdatebasket older basket newer consume fn string eat older newer oldernumfruits fnolderfruits oldernumfruits eat
student,so below is an image of on of the lecture slides from the structs and classes lecture this is at minute 3700 in the blue review recording i saw here that w is passed into poke and poke has the parameter const x z the way that i understood this is that the parameter requires that z is a pointer to a constant x x being the struct that was previously declared and that w is an x but not a const x w is the memory address of an x but it is not the memory address of a const x my question is this if w is not the memory address of a const x then why is still allowed to be passed in for a pointer that points to a const x thanks in advance
student,anyone whos awake and cramming for the exam youre welcome to join my friend and i to study in the ugli well be there in about 30 minutes message me on facebook if youd like to meet up were reviewing the practice exams and lectures and such
student,hey guys i just wanted to clarify a few things with pointers below is an example from lecture and i want to make sure im doing it right int a 1 2 3 int b 4 5 8 int c a int d b c d first command c d second command what are the final values of the arrays a and b in the first command c d is executed first the first element in d which is 4 is now the first element in c aka copied over so now array a is 4 2 3 and array b is 4 5 8 c d is executed now the index of c and d are both at the second element ie a 1 and b 1 array a is 4 2 3 and array b is 4 5 8 in the second command c d is executed first now the second element in d is now the second element in c aka copied over array a is 4 5 3 and array b is 4 5 8 c d is executed now the value at the second element in b is incremented by one ie a 1 6 so finally array a is 4 5 3 and array b is 4 6 8 someone please comment on whether my process is write or wrong andor what process i need to fixunderstand also when i say first element in d i mean d that points to b just wanted to clarify that thanks for the help

student,so im not sure if this has been asked but after entering const char str2 s p a m into an ide it works but in the review session they said that this wasnt a correct solution because its missing a null character at the end can anyone please clarify this
student,when checking that a variable is not null how do you know when to use the dereference operator and when not to for example when to use while a vs while a
student,for some reason my compiler is acting as if i dont have packcpp or packh included but when i include them in gamecpp it says that there are multiple definitions for the functions what is a good rule of thumb for including files for this project
student,so does the phrase or binds tighter than always apply if we have a pointer that is being incremented or decremented without a parenthesis the incrementor decrement will always happen to the address correct and if there is a increment or decrement operator used with a then it means the incrementor decrement will happen on the actual value of the thing the pointer points to correct so like d would eventually actually increment the value of the thing d poitns to but d would just increment the address one thing forward also if either of the above to examples are used alone on one line does it matter whether the or sign is to the left of or two the right of d
student,t const p i am a bit confused about using const here it says by placing the const here the pointer cannot be changed what does it exactly mean by the pointer cannot be changed does it mean like the place the pointer points to cant be change so you cant assign the pointer a different address than the one it allready has and then the const t p means that the value of the place the pointer points to cant be changed correct thanks
student,i did 2013 fall midterm and 2013 winter midterm some of the problem has following requirement you may not use any form of array indexing arraryi or arrayi so i am wondering does this also mean i am not allowed to use array and array1
student,will material from project 3 be on the exam
student,in c is this valid static int mainvoid and void mainint argc char argv
student,im trying to figure out how to do problem 3 but cant seem to get the correct answer is the following code close to what it should be any help is greatly appreciated char c whiledoc 0 c findkeydoc img printstrdoc findkeydoc
student,i know wen you pass a pointer into a function its passed by value does this mean that it can change the value of the thing it points to but not itself id not really understand can someone explain thanks
student,is foo1 a segfault error or is it a different type of error what exactly is the definition of a segfault error
student,can someone explain what this line of code does b a 1 first line in the helper1 function i just want to double check the answers that i have for 1a
student,for this problem is the secret supposed to be that only the numfruits is changed and not the order thus resulting in lemon mango nut orange for the answer or am i just over thinking this and its actually lemon plum nut orange
student,char str100 spam would strlenstr return 4 or 100
student,is anyone in the ugli right now and wants to compare the winter 2014 practice exam with me
student,for constructors in classes do we explicitly have to make some kind of constructor or does it automatically make one for us if none is made also is the only different between a default constructor and another constructor that the default one contains no parameters thanks
student,how to write the correct function of insert my code is here void insertchar str char spot char toinsert for int i0 i strlentoinsert i spot strlentoinsert spot spot strstrlenstrstrlenspot for int j0 j strlentoinsert j spot toinsert
student,from the lecture it says that structs only contain data and classes contain data and functions does this mean that structs are not able to contain functions or that by convention they shouldnt since if a struct was to contain functions you might as well use a class thanks
student,does someone want to compare answers for question 4a on w14 midterm instead of drawing the trees i will just write out the numbers i got for both columns for each function example tree input example tree input lastdigit 5 17 15 greaterthan three 5 12 6 7 17 15 20 13 10 between10and20 17 15 3
student,why for problem 2b am i allowed to in my for loopand the rest of the function write i fruitsnumfruits as opposed to i basketfruitsbasketnumfruits like how we do in problem 2a thanks
student,why would we need to traverse by pointer in this problem wouldnt we just call findkey to find the character at the beginning and end of the image and then call printstr on those to print the entire string that they wanted
student,is this okay to do for cstrings labster is saying that key1 and key2 cant be made but i thought thats how we learned how to make cstrings in lecture im really confused because in the question they use p as a parameter but labster wont let me const char key1 img const char key2 p const char start findkeydoc key1 const char end findkeydoc key2
student,for problem 4 on spring midterm exam function insert vidal did this problem by taking every char starting at spot and moving it strlentoinsert spots down this works as long as the length of toinsert plus the point that spot is pointing to is already empty can this be assumed if not what if the string was spamming and toinsert was aaa and the spot was a in spamming then he would start moving a down 3 spots and it would replace the i in spamming which would never be able to be seen again and thus could not be copied later on
student,so whats the difference between char x char x is the first a pointer to the array that is the second
student,could someone tell me what they got for 2c and 2d for 2c i got 4 2 1 3 6 5 7
student,ill be in bbb today from about 71230 in either 1620 or 1695 reviewing for the midterm without using vidals answers to test how well i know the material hopefully i am fairly knowledgeable of the material by now anyone is free to join always up to make new friends reply to this or email me at tahatekeumichedu to let me know if youre coming
student,my code is currently looping through fruits until it finds a match with eat when it finds the match it replaces wherever it found the match with the last element and then i return the decrement of numfruits i am seeming to suspect that my syntax is wrong i fruits numfruits which replaces wherever it found the match with the last element int eatfruitstring fruits int numfruits string eat for string i fruits i fruits numfruits i if i eat i fruits numfruits return numfruits else return numfruits
student,can we bring in 2 onesided papers instead of a double sided paper
student,in good with in person or online via voice chat if you are interested my email is sotokumichedu
student,how can we make peggs directly and get a number for f1 p is the address and eggs is also the address it does not make any sense here to get the difference of two adresses
student,which one is higher between these two signs
student,can the dot operator not be used to access member variables within a struct i tried to access numfruits in problem 2a by doing basketnumfruits or is it because the input for printbasket is a pointer and the dot operator cannot be used with pointers
student,i attended the review session and so i have the answers to the winter and spring midterm exams while reviewing i am looking at problem 3 in the winter 2014 midterm exam cstrings to find the starting point makes sense call findkeydoc img which use the cstring of doc and returns a pointer to the needed he set this equal to const char a i noticed to find the last char in the img vidal called findkey again in the notion of const char b findkeya this doesnt make sense to me because in this case a is a pointer to only the first element of the string is this a legit thing to do because a points in the string and knows everything else that resides past it in my mind you would be calling findkey with just one character and it would fail
student,for string i fruits i fruits numfruits i if i eat i fruits numfruits fruits numfruits 0 numfruits return numfruits in this code i am trying to loop through each string and if a string matches with eat then it should get the last element of the array and replace it wherever eat is then i put the last element as a null but for some reason i keep getting an error unhandled exception at 0x76ff0f22 in project4exe microsoft c exception stdbadalloc at memory location 0x00c9e434
student,is fruits a pointer to an array of pointers each of which point to strings or is fruits a pointer to an array of strings in other words if i have fruitsi does that give me a string or a pointer to a string
student,is this the answer for 1c if not please explain why please 42 45 46 46
student,what is the correct answer to filling them out where is the answer key it owuld be so helpful to have it
student,just like previous semesters are we allowed to use a double sided cheat sheet on the exam
student,hi i wrote some code for problem 2a to test my function and i just get segmentation fault does anyone know how i can find where it seg faults in the terminal i am currently just using my mac terminal with a text editor thanks main function int main basket basket string fruitstring4 mangoappleorangepeach basketfruits fruitstring basketnumfruits 4 printbasketbasket return 0 void printbasketconst basket basket forstring i basketfruits i ibasketnumfruits i cout i
student,up to which day of lecture
student,how to do the second question chop treesome hints
student,for question 1fii would the answers be a b d e im confused about whether e would be one of the correct answers because technically it does fit the rme definition 0 is indeed a nonnegative number however using this 0 in the function results in a setfault error are we supposed to disregard the error and just look at whether the 0 matches up with the rme
student,is anybody elses grade book empty
student,i am confused on how you can answer this probably quote maxafterpurchaseconst pricebook p unsigned int t because p is a pointer to a constant pricebook all the quotes in pricebook are const so if you try to access like this quote max 0 forint i 0 i psize i ifpquotesitime t max max pquotesi this is wrong because you are assigning a non const as a const however we have to make max nonconst because it needs to be able to hold all possible quote values this problem doesnt seem answerable based on the fact that const pricebook p
student,would the answer to 1d just be 4 program mike 1 alice… thanks
student,from problem 2c on the spring exam what exactly is fn supposed to do as far as im aware consume hasnt been initialized to any function
student,im having a hard time with the recursive tree functions i think i can do the base case fine but its the recursing that is tripping me up for the filtertree function i dont want to just return an empty tree the base case if the evaluated element returns false treemake every time so i somehow need to keep making the tree as i go and call filtertree on the subtrees could i do something like return treemaketreeelttree filtertreetreelefttree filter filtertreetreerighttree filter any general tips for tree functions would also be helpful ive been looking back at my project 2 as well
student,if p is a pointer to something does the following p mean 1 or 2 return value then decrement decrement then return value does the or the bind tighter thank you
student,for the f2 function when it executes int p eggs size does p point past the end of the array and give a segfault
student,i wrote my function for giggleb and i wanted to see if anyone thinks it looks good or bad im not 100 sure if it works like it should so it would be nice to have someone else look at it bool giggleb int a int b return a 10 b 10
student,im having trouble accessing the practice exams today through ctools when i try to open the exam through google drive it gives me a server error that didnt occur yesterday or the day before does anyone know what could be causing this thanks
student,could someone please explain this syntax to me int helper2int c int d c c 2 d c return d im very confused… if the return statement returns an address then why does it say the function returns an int
student,const char const str4 spam for int i 0 i 5 i cout str4i cout endl when i printed out str4 it printed this out s p a m that one quotations didnt print out in between the one quotations mean that there is a space if there is a space is that considered the null character
student,array 12345 int size 5 forint i array i array size i cout i endl cout endl for the following code i array size why dont we just use i size instead
student,am i allowed to assigned a tree positions value equal to null if i wanted to delete that portion of the tree for example elttreetreeleftt null
student,labster isnt loading for me anyone else having the same problem
student,when dealing with pointers pointer var means that the value of pointer is the value of var also if i did pointer var means that the value of pointer would be the address of var
student,just going through some of the slides and i have a question about pointers like such type cons p it says that the pointer cannot be changed does this mean that the address that the pointer points to cannot be changed
student,what is being passed into eatfruit
student,hello is the following a correct way to assign an already declared pointer to a new pointer where s is the previously declared one and word is the new one char s char word s thanks d
student,if it compiles is it a valid cstring or does it have to print out spam
student,i really cant seem to figure out what to change in the header even in labster the code given seems to compile fine any hints
student,i just have a few questions regarding c strings and their representations as arrays for example for the cstring char x hello the length of the string would be 5 but the size of the array that contains it would be 6 correct thanks
student,when passing arguments to a main function how is argc defined is it implicit based on how many arguments there are or does it have to be explicitly stated by the user
student,for f1 i agree that the first output should be 0 because both point to the same place in memory however im unsure why the numbers outputted are then increments of 1 integers are 4 bytes away in memory so i thought the output would be in increments of 4 does the compiler know that 4 bytes is the integer 1 so its printing that out for us
student,if you have to write a tailrecursive function and you use a helper function does the helper function also have to be tail recursive
student,how come when i have this there is no output and hi points to null char hello hello hello char hi strcpyhi hello hi hello ifstrcmphello hi0 cout ya endl yet when i comment out strcpy and uncomment the commented line above it outputs ya because the cstrings are the same char hello hello hello char hi strcpyhi hello hi hello ifstrcmphello hi0 cout ya endl
student,when you have a pointer to an array of strings which is written as such string fruits can you access elements in this array by saying fruits1 or must you increment fruits and then dereference it ie fruits then fruits
student,i have seen the previous discussion on this problem i am now still confused i tried the code end1 newchar i donot know what to do after i donot know how to delete those previous characters before end1 i get the answers like sham rather thanham
student,i know we cant use global variables but can we have static variables for example i want to declare a static int handcount that i can call in multiple functions within my gamecpp file is this allowed
student,struct quote double price unsigned int time double averageslopeconst pricebook p forquote q p quotes q pquotespsize 1 p shouldnt this be quote q pquotes
student,do you need to include rmes or comments in your code on the midterm exam
student,i have it in my notes that the following code int fconst int x int y x y y 1 return y int main int x x fx returns a compiler error whereas the following code int fconst int x int y y y 1 return y int main int x x fx x does not return an error does anyone know why this is
student,im looking through my notes and have written the scope resolution operation is needed in trianglecpp so the compiler knows it is a member function inside triangle my question is why if we have included triangleh which has all of the prototypes why do we need to tell the compiler this is it because triangle is a class and not just some normal function thanks good luck on your studying adventures
student,hi everyone i would like to request a sanity check for my understanding of addresses and pointers int num 3 int ptr num cout ptr endl does this return the address of num cout ptr endl does this return 3 thank you
student,so i can traverse the code and i understand all of it but i am having a hard time understand how in the sausage function void sausageint ptr ptr dereferences the pointer and increments the value at the memory location44 is changed to 45 ptr increments the value of the pointer which is some memory location which then points to to the next spot in the array spam2 the 3rd line ptr results in the pointer not incrementing at all shouldnt it point to spam2 instead of spam1
student,i am confused about howwhen to use dependency graphs is this a topic we should know for the exam or was it just to help us think through the problem given in lecture thanks
student,why are we taught that structs only contain data we use c and structs in c are the same as classes except their members are public by default they can indeed have constructors functions and you can use access modifiers on their members
student,has anyone else had issues with the bluereview recordings many of them lose all sound or are stuck on the same slide without sound for an hour is there any way these can be reuploaded if not could the answers to the inclass practice problems be uploaded at least
student,int main int a2 243 int b a helper1ab at this point wouldnt b be pointing to the third element in they array of a void helper1int a int b b a1 b 3 b
student,my question is about failed input streams in the scenario presented in this slide would the stream eventually enter a failed state im getting a bit confused…would foo just hold the value 42 and then the stream would enter a failed state and the qwertyn would still say in the buffer or would it not enter a failed state because the variable foo was able to read in the 42 and then it would just stop thanks
student,why was the value of d changed to 6 and not c i am confused because i read it as change the value of where c is currently pointing to a2 to the value of where d is currently pointing to b2 plus one so c d 1 but instead d incremented an dc was unaffected
student,does anyone know why the following code is giving me a seg fault i copied it verbatim from the lecture slides and it compiles fine but cant get the program to run const char array abc const char arrayptr array cout this is my array pointer arrayptr endl return 0
student,i was just curious if this exam would be completely short answer as it looks on the practice exams also are there no solutions to the practice exams
student,how are we supposed to edit the cstrings if we cannot use temporary arrayscstrings in 1042 the instructor posted in order to modify individual characters of a c string you need to declare it as an array but we are not allowed to use a temporary array so how can we even edit the cstring i tried something like startnewchar but it gives an access violation writing error
student,huge thanks to vidal for all the help you gave those of us who went to the review today pretty sure you guys are still going it was extremely valuable and helpful and we appreciate you taking the time to to go over things also shout out to the tasias who helped out as well thank you
student,to what extent will the readings from the book be useful if we do all the readings and understand all the material within them will we probably be in good shape for the exam
student,this is a very specific question using lecture 9 slides 1920 as an example you have several instances of a struct in an array and these structs contain data the data can be accessed how they are in the slides triangles0a3 triangles1b12 triangles2c17 it was also mentioned in the lecture that ab and c of each triangle are next to each other in memory therefore would it be possible to access this data with code like triangles003 triangles1112 triangles2217 in other words would going off the array still be accessing significant data in this case or am i just oversimplifying how memory works thanks
student,given the following code int x y int a 1 x a y 13 cout y y x 1 since y is uninitialized and thus not pointing to a particular place in memory when y is printed what prints 13 or another random integer 2 after x is assigned to y if y is printed again will 1 print
student,just wondering does anyone have tips for studying for this midterm so far im thinking of doing the practice exam and looking at lecture exercises labs and pastcurrent projects anything else we should be doing for this exam thanks
student,for accessing values that are within structs which are within another struct which is passed by pointer 1 pricebook quotesprice or 2 pricebook quotes price just to clarify is the reason why the top one is correct because pricebook quotes evaluates to a quote instead of a pointer to quote and to access within a value you use the operator
student,the spec states requires fruits points to an array of unique strings numfruits is equal to the number of strings in fruits effects searches fruits for eat if found swaps found element in fruits with last element in fruits returns number of strings in fruits not including the found element at most one match is possible after finding the correct element are we supposed to set the last element equal to the found element and chop off the last element it doesnt say that but otherwise i dont think the function makes a lot of sense either way if we have an array of strings and we want to remove one element whether it is the last first etc can we set that element equal to the null char 0 or is there a better way to do it thanks
student,char str100 spam cout str endl output would be s
student,1b which of the following lines of code creates variables that are valid c­strings circle all that apply one point will be deducted for each incorrectly circled item so don’t guess 0 points is the minimum 2 pts const char str1 ‘spam’ const char str2 ‘s’ ‘p’ ‘a’ ‘m’ const char str3 “spam” const char const str4 “spam” can somebody explain this question for me i am confused now
student,im trying to use gdb while i ssh into caen my files compile fine but when i try to run it it gives me this error missing separate debuginfos use debuginfoinstall glibc2121132el654x8664 libgcc4474el6x8664 libstdc4474el6x8664
student,is there any way we change a specific element of a ctring like char a abcdef can i replace c in chara with o if i can how can i do it i tried a2o but it doesnt work
student,do we always consider the player at index 0 to be the dealer or is index 0 like the player to the left of the dealer
student,just to clarify
student,what is the point of const member functions i thought if we have member variables in the private scope they cant be changed
student,hi will we need to know conversion to binary numbers and concepts like least significant bits and most sigificant bits as mentioned in the procedural abstractionrecursion lecture thank you
student,the problem directions state that once replace has been applied to the cstring spam it would become ham however it seems like the size of the array has been changed is that the first array slot of the cstring is empty or is it supposed to be hham
student,i have the following code within main char abc hello cout abc 1 endl int arr 1 2 3 4 5 cout arr endl cout arr 1 endl the first cout produces ello as output while the second and third produce an address my question is why does ello output for the first cout isnt abc just a pointer and cout abc should output an address just like how it did with the integer array
student,hi all so i understand that technically under the hood a cstring is a pointer that by default is pointing to the first character in an array of chars but then if we wanted to access the other chars in this array of chars we are able to traverse this array which we could do by adding 1 2 3 etc up to the length of this array to the value of the cstring pointer because then we are just modifying the memory address that this cstring points to hoping that these above points are correct my question is then this if cstrings are technically datatypewise pointers to an array of chars are all arrays technically pointers that point to to little slices of memory holding some group of values that are in a row ex there is an array of integers called numarr holding 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 is numarr the pointer datatype does it then point to the memory address holding the int 1 by default thank you in advance for clarifyng this point not an intended pun but…it works ha
student,why we need to use cstring for most parts of the program for me it seems better to use c string
student,i cant find the exam review on the google calender
student,whyhow does the difference between two char variables in this case p and s return an integer
student,can we assume that the number of players playing euchre follows the rules of the regular game in that there are 4 players and never more or less
student,when looping through a cstring what can you use as the condition for your counter in a for loop i know we are trying to iterate through until the null character but im not sure how to write this
student,i have tried run the functions in the problem to figure out how things like p p p actually works my problem is i dont understand why p would give me 0 and also when i try p i thought i would got 0 but i got exception error so how does the parenthesis actually works why it works for p
student,i am not sure when to return a postive number or when to return a negative number that part is very unclear
student,is there a gametestscpp im trying to figure out how i can test my gaminit function
student,sometimes when i make a function i create a temporary card object or other variables will i lose style points for this
student,when hand0 the dealer is player0 i wonder after hand change will dealer still 0 or is there any rule that i can follow to decide who is next dealer
student,it seems that piazza is not showing any option to submit right now the dropdown arrow on the autograder brings up nothing
student,the test for the playcard function fails because it seems like i have an additional card ten of spades in my hand bobs hand i know that card should be dropped after the adddiscard test and i pass the tests for that function but somehow i pick it up again any ideas what might be causing this problem
student,okay so i wrote my playercpp and passed published tests unfortunately on autograder it did not compile and no matter how much i looked i did not see a problem i dont use anything windows specific i dont have unused variables i was passing tests without a problem what else can cause compilation error
student,i dont know if anyone noticed this but the shuffle function that swaps the first 17 cards with the last 7 cards in a deck 3 times does the same operation as swapping the first 3 cards with the last 21 cards 73 21 24 so no weird things happen with the cards will it be acceptable if one were to change the shuffle function to swapping the first 3 cards with the last 21 cards since this is logically equivalent to the required shuffle
student,i have compiled my code in xcode and in linux and it works in both i passed all my test cases and the published test cases but when i submit to the autograder i get a compilation error for both packtest00cpp and playertest00cpp however when i use the published test cases to compile my code in linux it works as well why do i keep getting a compilation error
student,when i went to ohs before the gsi told me to copy and paste the direct address of my packin file into the function call of packinit since the file was not opening without it obviously the published test cases do not have this address specification so when i run the published test cases to pack i cannot open packin another gsi said to include cstdlib but it is still not opening for me i included cstdlib in both packcpp and packtestscpp just to be sure
student,we have made our tar file using a folder which 100 contains cardcpp packcpp playercpp and grouptxt but when we submit to the auto grader it says we arent including cardcpp in the tar file any ideas why this could be happening
student,when i submit to the autograder i see a compilation error when conducing playertest00 which i cannot replicate with make playertests in the caen linux environment are there any recommended debugging steps for finding the compilation error
student,im finishing up the final player published test case but im confused it asserts that the card played isnt the queen of spades but isnt that the card the player should be playing given that the queen of spades is his mincard since spades is the trump
student,for initialize card is it not possible to do pointer arithmetic because rank and suit are have the const modifier before them
student,our playercpp file is running with no errors in our compiler but then when running it with terminal we found an unknown error after compiling in the linux environment it turns out the error was undefined reference to main in out playercpp we are not sure what this means please help
student,if i make my own pack to test my initializing function and call it pack2in and use it in my packtestscpp will this be a problem for the auto grader because its a file that it doesnt have the instructors dont have
student,ive heard conflicting answers for this and i just want someone to answer definitively do we need to make our own test cases to turn in for the checkpoint i know we need to make our own test cases for the final turn in and that it is a good idea to have test cases for the checkpoint anyway but what i would like to know yes or no are they required for the checkpoint turn in i only ask because some places say yes and other places say no on here it seems to be more nos than yess but i talked to a professor who said yes we do need our own test cases so im very confused i dont understand why im getting conflicting answers from people who should know the answer since this is something so fundamental for the turn in for this project thanks i appreciate anyone who could clear this up for me
student,as of now i am going about packshuffle by creating a holder pack initialized to the preshuffled pack pointed to by packptr then i reassign the cards in pack to the cards in packshuffle so that the pack is cut in the way the specs describe in order to do this i have 1 for loop reassigning the first 7 cards of pack to the last 7 cards of the holder pack but then when i try to reassign the last 17 cards of pack to the first 17 cards of holder pack i am getting the first 7 cards of pack repeatedly fed in from holder pack basically my holder pack is changing its card values as packptr does how do i keep the holder packs cards separate from the packptr
student,im having trouble figuring out how to delete a card in playerleadcard were supposed to delete the card that has been played how would i go about doing this
student,hi im trying to do shuffle as the spec states and when i exit out of my function the card at the 0 index is queen of spades however packtests00 calls next on the pack and gets the increment of queen of spades for me this should reference the next card of the pack wouldnt this make the 0 index jack of spades right now queen of spades is my 0 index next on cards is king of spades and its not working
student,in the effects of playermaketrump it says that if the player wishes to order up a trump suit then do certain things and to do other things if they do not but how do we know if they want to order up a suit there is no argument that will indicate whether they want to or not
student,maybe im reading the shuffle directions wrong but ive read and reread it multiple times and isnt shifting the top 7 cards to the bottom 3 times the same thing as adding the bottom 3 cards to the top
student,in player add and discard the requires in the spec says that he needs to have at least 1 card in his hand when would you ever add and discard besides at the beginning when he has 5 cards in his hand
student,can we use both all of the provided test cases and add cases of our own so long as we still test every function
student,hey so the compiler says that my playertest does not compile but i have rub it on both my pc and caen ones and it compiles and passes the tests am i doing something wrong or is thwre a problem with the autograder
student,when i compile my cardtest00cpp i get undefined references for all of my functions in cardcpp my compile line is makefile cardtest00cpp my intuition tells me that cardtest00cpp is not properly linked to my cardcpp file any help
student,my code compiles and works fine with the test cases i wrote and am planning on submitting but i have to include the cpp files along with the h files in the test cases because otherwise i get errors saying undefined reference to every function i tested if i just include the h files the test cases we are submitting against only have h files included how do i fix this
student,there was no implement me in the comments but do we implement this function despite the return statement that was already given in it
student,im running my packcpp file using the published test cases and i get the output of error opening packin but i also get the message program ended with exit code 1 shouldnt it be 0 what does this mean
student,if we know what the proper order of the cards should be after the third shuffle can we change our deck straight to that order or do we actually have to have our program perform the shuffle three times
student,whats the difference between cardtestscpp and cardtests00cpp that were given to us
student,whats the easiest way to print out a pack just cardprint after every card initialization
student,how do we get the suit of upcard we cannot call cardgetsuit since we do not know the trump yet
student,for task 1 i am unsure as to how i would compare each individual character to one another any hints for how i would go about this
student,i am trying to fix my packinit and for some reason every time i try to read in the file it fails to open i copied the code from lecture so i wonder maybe if the file is in the wrong place im using xcode help please
student,so say a student found a partner today and wanted to work on the remainder of project 3 with said partner after each student has already finished the work for the checkpoint on their own would that student and their partner need to submit the same file for this checkpoint or could they get away with each of them submitting their own code now and then submitting the final project 3 together
student,i for the life of me can not seem to get the next pointer to work correctly can anyone help explain how to initialize it and how to use it in the other functions my current method of packptrnext results in an error saying that the statement has no effect any help is appreciated thanks in advanced
student,how do we check that two pointers point to the same place assume the pointers were both of the same type and were named foo and bar would i just say if foo bar thank you
student,i was told that a comparison should be made during screw the dealer between the player pointer and dealer pointer to see if they are the same did anyone else do this and if so could you elaborate on why and the strategy behind this thanks
student,how would you recommend studying for the exam also would is the 2 weeks after the exam enough time to get the part of the project after the checkpoint done
student,when i am trying to test packtests i use the command packtests tee packtestsout within the caen linux terminal however when i run it it doesnt print anything inside the terminal does anyone know what the problem may be
student,do we do any card adding in this function or just modifying order up suit and returning truefalse
student,in playercpp for the function playermaketrump im trying to compare the suit of the card that the player has to the suit of the same color of the upcard unfortunately im getting errors in referencing for the players suit i have it as playerptr handi suit but my terminal error states base operand of has nonpointer type const card how do i reference it correctly
student,what suit is the dealer supposed to call out of the remaining three
student,will the dealer ever discard the upcard in any scenario other than when the dealer already has a hand of 5 cards matching the upcards suit and the upcard has a lower rank than all 5 cards in the dealers hand
student,ive made my checkpoint submission and it looks all good but the autograder link from ctools is only offering the option of submitting to the project 3 checkpoint wherehow do i make my final submission of the complete program
student,can someone give me the command line in the terminal for compiling the cardcpp packcpp and playercpp and if i wanted to add the test cpp files too i would just add them into the command list right
student,im confused about how to get input from packin and convert it to a types rank and suit im currently reading strings from packin and converting them to c strings in the function call of cardinit which appears to be working but i keep failing my assertion in string2enum when i used cout to try and figure out what my file was reading in the output looks like nine ofspades tenof spadesjack how can i read input from the file without getting strings that are two words smashed together
student,for the playerleadcard function after figuring out if the player should play the highest nontrump card in his hand or the highest trump in his hand how does one go about removing that specific card
student,im a little unclear how play works between hands i think the way it works is that within a hand each player loses one of their cards until everyone has zero cards at this point the majority of the cards have been discarded and there are only a couple remaining what happens next does the pack get reset if shuffle was off at the beginning of the game do we shuffle between hands if we dont shuffle between hands well just keep getting the same result over and over unless possibly were supposed to shift the remaining cards to the beginning and add in the discarded cards to the end at the beginning of each hand we go through one or two rounds of making is this correct thanks
student,im having trouble understanding what it means to initialize card next in packcpp from what i gathered it sounds like you just make next equal to the first card of the pack my cardinit for cardsi looks like this cardinitpackptrcardsi rank suit and it works so i assumed the init for next would just look like this cardinitpackptrnext rank suit using if selection so it happens for just the first card however its saying next is not declared in this scope any help
student,when the dealer is deciding to order up does heshe include the upcard as one of the two potential trump cards in hisher hand if heshe does order up it will be
student,when i tried to compile in visual studio with strcpy it wouldnt compile and told me i should be using strcpys instead i did that and it compiled but now it wont compile on linux a quick google search has not turned up the appropriate library to include at the top of my file does anyone know what library strcpys is from
student,in packcpp we are to exit the code if there is an error reading in packin should we implement this error check in an int main or can we just put it at the top of each our our functions in packcpp init deal one reset shuffle would the int main function ever even run because isnt the only time packcpp is used is when init deal one reset and shuffle are tested through packtests
student,so i declared next in packinit but am having trouble with it in my other functions what do i do so that it is available in my other functions
student,i have heard conflicting answers as i know others have as well and i am just looking for a concrete answer for the checkpoint do we need to have our own test cases written and submitted i know we need them for the final submission but i am only concerned with the checkpoint for now i have submitted to the autograder for the checkpoint and i pass all the tests this means i am good for the checkpoint correct
student,if a player can follow suit he plays the highest card that follows suit otherwise he plays the lowest card in his hand according to project specs if this is the case 1 when do we play the trump card 2 when the led suit is the trump suit do we play the highest card from trump suit only or trump suit including left bower thanks
student,when im trying to send my checkpoint file to the autograder im getting the following message error submission archive is missing the file cardcpp you have not been charged a submission i do have cardcpp in the archive so im just a little bit confused what might be causing this thanks
student,anyone know how i can fix this problem this is what happens when i do make packtests on linux i am in the directory that contains my files for the checkpoint my code compiles and runs perfectly in xcode bash41 make packtests g packtestscpp o packtests packtestscpp718 error packh no such file or directory packtestscpp818 error cardh no such file or directory packtestscpp in function u2018int mainu2019 packtestscpp17 error u2018packu2019 was not declared in this scope packtestscpp17 error expected u2018u2019 before u2018packu2019 packtestscpp18 error u2018packu2019 was not declared in this scope
student,will our test cases for the checkpoint be graded or will only card pack and player be graded ive seen multiple seemingly conflicting answers on this and im trying to get a clarification
student,i get the pack to read from packin and initialise all the cards in the pack properly on windows but when i compile in linux the entire pack gets initialised to two of spades im assuming this is a readfromfile quirk of linux that makes it treat packin differently than in windows does anyone have any suggestionsfixes to this either a readfromfile quirk or a string quirk with cardinit i have doublechecked and i am not comparing memory locations of the char strings being passed to cardinit
student,i am having a very odd problem with shuffle the function pretty much works all the cards are in the right order the first card is correct however the only incorrect card is the last card it should be jack of spades but it is an out of order nine of spades i am printing out the cards so i can error check and somehow my function has created another nine of spades in place of the jack of spades any possible explanations for this
student,we passed the test cases provided by mr deorio just fine but when we submit to the autograder it says compilation error for playercpp what does this mean
student,if we are passing the autograder for the checkpoint but we still want to add more test cases can we still add more test cases to our project after the checkpoint is passing the autograder all we need to do for the checkpoint
student,quick question on packinit i am using getline to get the suit and rank for each card and then have been splitting them into separate char with strtok i have also been using x as a counter so i can traverse the cards array within the pointer struct when i go to implement cardinitpackptrcardsx rank suit suit and rank are the split char i get this error error c2665 cardinit none of the 2 overloads could convert all the argument types i think im calling the packptr wrong but i dont know how to fix it any help would be appreciated
student,i am trying to take the value that packptrnext points to and return it in packdealone however the compiler keeps telling me it error cannot convert card to card in initialization any help would be appreciated thanks
student,im having difficulties passing the handsize 5 assertion in the published playertests file im overwriting the discarded card with whatever card is added so im not sure how it could be failing any help is appreciated
student,im running into a very strange consistent error when trying to test playerleadcard the function seems to in some way add a space and an endoftransmission characterascii value 0004 to the name of the player passed to the function this causes the strcmpalicename alice 0 assert at the beginning of playertestscpp to evaluate to false exiting the test program ive rewritten the function 3 times with completely different structures in an attempt to figure out whats accessing alicename that shouldnt be but ive had no luck so far nothing seems to be going off the end of its respective array or anything like that so im stumped has anyone else had a similar problem with this function thanks
student,hi i am having troubles passing a published test case in playercpp i dont understand the following the code below from the published test case bob will throw away the upcard if its lower than the cards in his hand playeraddanddiscardbob ninespades assertbobhandsize 5 for int i0 ibobhandsize i assertplayerhascardinhandawesomespadeshand i bob when i 4 awesomespadehand 4 passes a pointer pointed to the last element to the function playerhascardinhand in function playerhascardinhand the pointer will be accessed 5 times to access the five cards however the pointer only points to a card array that has 5 cards this visits an empty pointer when i is larger than 1 will this cause a problem
student,see summary
student,i keep getting lines and lines of errors when i try to run my packcpp with the unit tests provided by the professor…here are the first few lines of the error what could be going wrong thanks bash41 make packtest g packtestcpp o packtest tmpcckfurweo in function main packtestcpptext0x1b undefined reference to packinitpack char const
student,i ask this question in light of deorio posting the unit tests for all the functions for everyone to see today are these test cases all of the test cases we have to pass in order to get full credit on the checkpoint also are we still required to write our own test cases to turn in for the checkpoint i understand from previous piazza questions and answers that for the final turn in not the checkpoint we will have to pass more rigorous test cases and we will be expected to develop better test cases to account for this is this understanding correct i appreciate anyone who can answer any or all of my answers thanks
student,we actually implement this change to dealer in maketrump right not in the game the modifies in the rme doesnt say dealer
student,if we pass all the autograder tests for the checkpoint can we assume that our functions work completely and go ahead and start working on game and the other files or are we supposed to test our functions more thoroughly
student,i keep getting error message for having a wrong partner declaration i tried adding a new line after the unique names and i also tried just having a space between the names but it still gives me an error screenshot20141007at90939pmpng
student,in packinit im initializing each card using cardinitcard rank suit rank and suit are both const char but for some reason when i cardprintcard on the very next line its only prints two of spades which is what every card is initialized to no matter what it does print the right thing when i manually put in the values ie cardinitcard ten diamonds cardprintcard prints ten of diamonds i dont know whats going on im putting in a const char which is what it asks for but it doesnt work unless i put a specific string in
student,when compiling any of the main functions in visual studio im getting an undefined reference error for all the functions in cardcpp these errors have the same basic form error lnk2019 unresolved external symbol enum suit cdecl suitnextenum suit suitnextyaaw4suitw41z referenced in function main if anyone could help that would be awesome ive checked and all the files are included in the build so im not sure why it isnt linking properly
student,in the terminal for my mac can someone tell me the code to make a tar file with all the files we have to submit to the auto grader thank you
student,in our playercpp file we have the line include playerh but when we try to write functions we get an error in xcode unknown type name player anyone know whats going wrong thanks
student,in the second cardcompare do we still return 0 if a and b are the same cards but ledcard is different another scenario that i have in question is how about if ledcard is the same as a but b is different what should it return
student,is there a difference between using to check if a cards suit is trump or cardistrump if there isnt which one is preferred
student,for some reason when i run the card compare that is given to us its returning the wrong answer im trying to compare a jackclubs and a queenspades looking at how the function is built it finds the difference between the sum of each cards rank and suit if i use cardcomparejackclubs queenspades it should return 1 because spades is less than club but its not not sure if im the problem or the function is actually buggy at that case thanks
student,the posted test cases included assertcardcompareacediamonds acehearts ninediamonds hearts 0 this suggests to me that if card a ace diamonds card b ace of hearts led card 9 diamonds trump hearts then card b has a higher value than card a however if a heart is led shouldnt following suit be more important than a trump card thanks
student,so i have written all my code for the checkpoint and tried submitting it to the auto grader but i get a compile error on playertests i wrote the code in sublime text and was able to compile and run it on my mac terminal compiling it with g to see if my compiling was different from that of a caen linnux environment i sent the code to my caen desktop via an scp command line then i moved to my terminal in caen with a ssh command once there i re compiled and was able to but when i ran it i got the error cannot execute binary file i was wondering if this happened in the auto grader and thats why it didnt work keeping in mind that my other two cpp files passed the autograder
student,if you have something like char temp how come the compiler knows to print the c string if you cout temp at first i thought i had to iterate through and append all the values of the c string array to a c string to get the original string back why doesnt it cout the location that temp points to
student,my partner and i are consistently failing the test case for playercpp weve tested the code in all the ways that we think may break it but we still cant find the error are there any suggestions or common errors made by other groups that have led to a similar problem thanks
student,i keep getting these error messages and i went through my sections of code related to each one and i am unsure of what is wrong anyone know what the hell is causing this error to go throughout my code need help asap
student,in round 2 the player has jack of spades jack of hearts ten of diamonds king of diamonds king of hearts the upcard is queen of clubs since trump is clubs jack of spades is considered to be of the clubs suit since there is no suit that is spades the player will not order up correct
student,so we have to modify the orderupsuit here do we have to add and discard to the dealers hand if a suit is ordered up in round 1 or do we call add and discard in our playertestscpp also what is orderupsuit initialized to in the beginning thanks
student,if i can pass the test case in cpp file does that mean i can also pass the checkpoint autograder
student,my cardcpp playercpp and packcpp pass my tests and the published unit tests however when i submit to the autograder only cardcpp and playercpp pass while my packcpp gets a compilation error any suggestions on how to debug this problem
student,once i have looped through the hand of cards and identified the highestlowest card depending on the case how can i know which element of the array this card is so i can then move it to the end
student,whenever i try to implement the cardinit function using the string2enum i get an error message saying there is no matching function call i copied and pasted the template string2enum code from the lecture slide and then called it in the cardinit using the to differentiate between suit and rank is there something else that im missing
student,has anybody passed playercpp in the autograder if so what are the top 2 functions you reccommend to inspect for bugs
student,do we call the make trump function for each players move or do we actually call it once to get the trump also what is the upcard parameter
student,within the add and discard function we need to use card compare to figure out if one has a better value than the other but how do we know what the trump is when we are writingcalling the function or should we just use the version of card compare that only takes two arguments and not the trump
student,i get this problem when i try to compile my packcpp and packtestscpp files i have included cardh in each of them and i know that i dont go off the array i get the same error when i only operate on the first and second elements in the array any help would be greatly appreciated
student,in round one if playerptr dealer do we include the upcard as a possible card in the dealers hand when determining the number of trump face cards for example if the up card is the ace of hearts and the dealer has the jack of hearts in his hand would he order up because his resultant hand would have 2 trump face cards or would he pass because in his current hand he only has 1 trump face card
student,i have gone through almost every scenario and fixed several bugs in my code for cardcpp and its still not passing the autograder am i just understanding the specs wrong in the third cardcompare the one that also uses the lead card is a card with the same suit as the lead always supposed to be a higher value than the other one assuming the other card is of another suit for example if i have assertcardcompareninediamonds jackdiamonds queendiamonds hearts 0 as a unit test should this pass because the way i understand the specs currently it should the left bower is not a diamond so i return 1 because the nine of diamonds is
student,i want to clarify what is meant by lowest card in the specs if the card is ordered up it says the lowest card is discarded does this mean the card with the lowest value ie the 9 of diamonds would be the lowest if the player had this card or does it just mean the lowest number ie a player would discard the 9 of trump before discarding the ace of another suit
student,out of the total 9 of the projects class worth
student,when incrementing a pointer do both do the same thing or is only one of them right thingotherthing thingotherthing
student,please keep in mind that the autograder does not assign grades project grades also take style efficiency and other deliverables into account test cases used for grading may be completely different than those used to evaluate trial submissions your submittargz file failed to extract properly make sure that the following command successfully unpacks your archive tar xzvf submittargz you have not been charged a submission make sure that your archive included all the required files i am getting the following message when i try submitting to the autograder my checkpointsubmittargz has the following files in it cardtestscpp cardcpp cardh packtestscpp packcpp packh playertestscpp playercpp playerh grouptxt
student,so ive been trying to use the gdb debugger but have gotten several issues including that the program isnt running i am just trying to see where my shuffle function is going wrong so can someone please post a useful link on how to use the debugger all the other links i find online do not help thanks
student,we have been waiting for someones oh in bbb1695 for almost 40 minutes is this oh canceld
student,in our function for packinit are we supposed to initialize the next pointer to point to the first card in that pack
student,we keep getting wa in our playercpp implementation on the autograder is there anyway we can see which function is messing up since the test cases are supposed to be published
student,i just read this in the spec and i had heard differently from different people so i wanted to make sure but for the checkpoint on wednesday we only need to pass the three init test cases that are published in the test cpp files or do we need to have all of the card pack and player functions implemented
student,if its round 2 and the upcard is hearts does jack of diamonds count towards the number of diamond face cards also lets say trump is hearts if the lead suit is diamonds would playing a jack of diamonds count as following suit would it count if the lead suit was hearts
student,i am trying to compile my packtests file but whenever i use card functions for the sake of assertions it fails on account of undefined refences even though i did include cardh in packtests does anyone know what could be happening thanks
student,my packdealone returns the correct card and to increment the pointer i write packptr but when i call packdealone multiple times it keeps returning the first card meaning the pointer is not being incremented ive tried doing it many other ways but cant seem to get it is there a different way to do it or am i doing it incorrectly
student,with the new added rule of the suits being ordered if neither of the cards are trump a king of diamonds would have a higher value than a king of clubs
student,are we supposed to increase the handsize when we add a card through that function the h doesnt specifically say to do this but it makes implementation much simpler
student,my packinit keeps on failing at calling the file packin and i think the problem is that its not in the right directory how do you change so the file location is the desktop thanks
student,so my hand is jack of hearts queen of clubs king of spades the trump card the dealer receives is jack of diamonds does he discard queen of clubs
student,this is probably a really silly question but when we are told to call exitexitfailure does that mean something different than actually calling that in our code as we would call a function because my code wont compile as is and im not sure why
student,for the last two functions in playercpp the person leadsplays a card depending on predetermined strategy but im confused as to what constitutes actually removing the card from the array i adjust handsize and reorganize the hand array so the remaining cards all fit in the first handsize positions of the array however i dont understand how to remove the lingering element i tried setting it equal to null which didnt work and i currently am assigning to it an initialized card with undefined rank and suit is this acceptable or am i missing something
student,do we we have to write test cases for the functions in cardh that have already been implemented or do we only have to write test cases for the functions that we implement ourselves
student,so im trying to find the bug in my code that makes my playercpp fail the autograder the spec says each other hand must follow the led suit if able and otherwise may play any card does this mean if player 1 leads a card player 2 doesnt have to follow the led suit but player 3 does why would the spec say otherwise may play any card
student,what should we return if the pack has been completely dealt out and like what do we change next to we cant increment it anymore
student,so does packdealone return the nine of spades first like if the pack being passed in is the ordered one they gave us then it would output 10 jack queen etc
student,for the autograder checkpoint in the spec it says we only need to pass the published unit tests does this mean we need to pass only the unit tests given to us in the test cases files or some other unknown test cases that the autograder runs i guess what it boils down to is which functions within cardcpp packcpp and playercpp need to be finished and working properly or is it all of them or are we not supposed to explicitly know
student,2 or 3 sorry i forget
student,hi everyone when im not on a caen computer using linux i usually use the vnc client to use linux however it is quite laggy and sometimes it crashes too what do you guys use to code when youre on your laptop and not on a caen computer which do you recommend best of luck on the project 3 checkpoint
student,im a bit confused when is it appropriate to use the and when do you omit it what is the difference especially when initializing any clarification would be greatly appreciated
student,i wrote packcpp and ran it both using visual studio and the linux terminal with g in both cases the published test cases in packtestscpp run without error however when i run the autograder the packtests fails i have gone through the code several times and cannot wrap my head around what the problem is is there anything that i could potentially have overlooked any help would be appreciated
student,when i make my tar file to submit for the checkpoint it properly assembles all of the required files including cardcpp however upon submission to the autograder the autograder feedback returns that cardcpp is missing and a submission has not been charged i went back and opened up the tar file to make sure cardcpp was there and it was ive also ensured that the file name is correct with no extra characters etc ideas
student,from lecture we decided that we dont need to modify anything in flatlandcpp my question though is havent we changed the way to construct a triangle so when you make a triangle your third argument has to be an angle in radians and not a side i understand how we can convert the angle to a side c to use within trianglecpp using some trig but my question is why triangleabc still works if the constructor is triangleabangle when using the triangle constructor in flatlandcpp thanks
student,i am not very familiar with linux can anyone give me the instruction about how to make checkpoint tar in linux i tried make checkpoint tar but it doesnt work is there anything else i need to do
student,say diamonds is trump when comparing just the two cards does the card king of clubs lose to ace of hearts
student,are we being graded on our test cases for the checkpoint or is it just a matter of whether or not our functions pass the autograders test cases
student,i am trying to do packdealone and it says we have to increment next but i am not sure what is the syntax for that i tried doing this packptrnext packptrcardsi but i cannot initialize i 0 or it will always deal the first card
student,bluereview on oct 1 for section 002 is not uploaded
student,might be obvious but for this function playermaketrumpconst player playerptr const card upcard const player dealer int round suit orderupsuit what do we put in as suit orderupsuit a suit pointer what exactly is that
student,so ive been working through eclipse and linux on my laptop where everything compiles fine but when i submit to the autograder i always get a compiler error on packtests ive checked to make sure that i wrote a function for every header in packh as well
student,plain and simple will we be graded for our style on the checkpoint or just for the final project
student,i have written in my notes that we should use the fstream code from lecture 8 for packinit but in that function the filename is already a string whereas packinit is passed const char packfilename i tried using cstring to convert this to a string but i get an error message how do you use the passed packfilename pointer to open the file
student,did the p2 ag preliminary results been sent to our emails yet
student,title
student,i copied and pasted the code from lecture for string2enum and implemented it in cardinit but when i try to compile it i get the error that there is no matching function call for string2enum and the candidate template is ignored couldnt infer template argument t what am i missing to make this work
student,the dealer is passed into the playermaketrump function but it doesnt seem like he is ever used in the function do we have to consider the upcard as part of the dealers hand or is there another reason why he is passed into the function
student,will the handsize of a player always be 5 when making the trump
student,please help i keep getting next is not declared in this scope inside the packinit function i have no idea how to access next
student,i am implementing the packinit function and i get the following error no matching function for call to cardinit cardinitcardptrrk st cardh466 note candidate function not viable no known conversion from string aka basicstringchar chartraitschar allocatorchar to rank for 2nd argument void cardinitcard cardptr rank rank suit suit cardh536 note candidate function not viable no known conversion from string aka basicstringchar chartraitschar allocatorchar to const char for 2nd argument void cardinitcard cardptr const char rank const char suit i guess it is because i used cardinit on non const strings but how am i suppose not to change the data of the string if i am inputing it from a file
student,the feedback of autograder shows running test playertest00 compilation error the remaining two tests are passed dose anyone know what does this mean
student,the spec says that a person will order up if they have two or more face cards of the shown suit but that in round 2 if they have one face card of the same suit as the shown they will order up so if a player has one face card of the shown suit do they order up on round 2 the shown suit like if a 9 of hears o is up and a player has a king of hearts they wont order up round one for hearts but do they order hearts on round 2
student,so in round 1 if the dealer is playerptr then everything goes as if he is a player not in round 2
student,in the provided file at the end of the tests it says pack test pass should we change this to card test pass
student,i am implementing the packcpp and i wrote a test function and the first function in packcpp but i got the weird error after i typed in the make file command g pedantic wall werror o1 packtestscpp packcpp cardcpp o packtests undefined symbols for architecture x8664 packinitpack char const referenced from main in packtestsa1ff2ao ld symbols not found for architecture x8664 clang error linker command failed with exit code 1 use v to see invocation make packtests error 1 can anyone tell me what is wrong here
student,for the cardinit function as the first parameter i used packptrcardsi and packptrcardsi but i seem to get an error in visual saying this statement unhandled exception at 0x00fbbf43 in project3exe 0xc0000005 access violation reading location 0xcccccccc i feel like nothing is wrong with my logic but i am not sure where to go from here
student,so in the make trump function 134 suit suitptr suitnextupcardsuit 135 orderupsuit suitptr in function ‘bool playermaketrumpconst player const card const player int suit’ playercpp134 error lvalue required as unary ‘’ operand i tried doing it without the and it failed as well i dont get how to mess with a suit pointer
student,so im trying to work with the initial work of packinit following the steps done in io lecture from last week so i start by taking in the char packfilename i transfer it to another char called filename i then create an ifstream called filestream then i try to open the file through filestream with filestreamopenfilenamecstr as the slides suggest and all sources on the internet do but when i try to compile it says request for member ‘cstr’ in ‘filename’ which is of nonclass type ‘const char’ what do i do about this my interpretation is that the error is reading the csstr to be a call within filename but ive included all the given files tasked to us is this just another problem caused by using ubuntu open requires a cstring filename is just a char and cstr is supposed to give a string representation
student,in the project spec it says if a player can follow suit he plays the highest card that follows suit otherwise he plays the lowest card in his hand when a player considers following suit barring the trump suit does not match lead suit does he consider his trump cards as being suit cards since they are stronger than the suit cards or does he solely consider suit cards any help would be appreciated
student,how does assert work i get that it will crash a program is whatever is in the brackets returns false so if we put assert in our test cases the program will stop running at that point
student,is the next card equivalent to the card on top of the deck for example when dealing one should next refer to the card that is now left at the top of the pack thanks
student,how do you get the player to discard the specified card in these functions
student,im using the new version of xcode and fstream is not working i have packin in the right place and all my code is correct i had a gsi look over it all ifstream and ofstream cant open files someone told me the new xcode has a setting that you have to change to make it work but i cant find it anywhere anyone have any ideas of whats going on
student,im very sorry if this has been answered i couldnt find it in the feed but is the only thing being graded for the checkpoint our codes ability to pass the test cases given by the auto grader do we need our test cases and things done as well thanks
student,does the player always have to exchange one of his cards for the upcard is it possible that he doenst pick up the upcard if all the cards in his hand are stronger than the upcard ie upcard nine of hearts players hand jack of hearts jack of diamonds ace of hearts ten of hearts any help would be appreciated
student,so in the function make trump round 1 order up suit can only be the trump candidate round 2 order up suit can either be trump candidate or if the dealer is the same as the player the order up suit is the suit of the other color of the trump candidate
student,hi i am trying to store word1 and word2 in each element of the array of cards but the compiler says cards is undefined i know i have to put in a address for the first parameter of cardsinit but to me it looks like i am i am not sure what else to put in the first parameter for int i 0 i 24 i packptrcardsi cardinitcardsi word1cstr word3cstr
student,good evening when i call packshuffle should it shuffle 3 times or does it only shuffle it once and i should call packshuffle 3 times in packtestscpp thank you
student,i am implementing the void cardinitcard cardptr const char rank const char suit function and i am always getting the assert condition at last i dont know what is wrong part of my code looks like this forint i0 iranksizei ifstrcmpranknamesirank0 cardptrrank staticcastranki i wonder what is wrong with such implementation
student,i get a string value from the ifstream but i couldnt figure out how to transfer that value into the packptr the pack pointer do i have to initialize the struct and work with that
student,i dont understand this function how does the player parameter choose to orderup or not are we expected to make a randomize function for it to choose whether or not to orderup is the dealer parameter there just to make sure that heshe is the last person to choose to order up each round thanks
student,ive been trying many different things for this function but i keep getting the same error of lvalue required as increment operand i correctly assign the card to the first element of the array hand but next i need to increment the pointer for hand so im not just overriding the first card in the array every time obviously im not doing the whole pointerarray incrementation thing correctly
student,hi when we run the lead card function should we remove that card from the hand thanks
student,my partner receives a score for proj 2 but i donot can somebody explain
student,hi very inexperienced programmer here aside from engineering 101 where in the world do i even begin to actually write code the spec confuses me more and more every time i read it im just asking an honest question as i really dont know where to even start with this project if at all possible what are some good starting points and tips to get started thanks a ton
student,are there any rules against using this method for a for loop
student,from the project spec leading when a player leads a trick he plays the highest non­trump card in his hand if he has only trump he plays the highest trump card in his hand will the left bower be considered a trump card when leading any help will be appreciated
student,good afternoon for the fstream code that professor deorio told us to explicitly copy into our code and modify ourselves when necessary wherehow do we use this code ive only finished cardcpp so far and i have not run into the issue of using this tidbit yet string filename hellotxt ifstream filestream filestreamopen filenamecstr if filestreamisopen cout open failed endl exit1 string word while filestream word cout word word n filestreamclose thanks
student,is passing the published test files the only tests we need to pass in order to pass all 3 of the p3 autograder tests or are there additional tests i have passed all of the published tests in the testcpps but still am not passing the player portion of the autograder i have written additional test and passed also but still getting a fail for player thank you
student,because we have multiple main function in this project when i want to test a cardcpp how can the compiler know which function it should call
student,from the project spec requires playerptr points to an initialized player player has at least one card the only instance when adding and discarding are done is in making the trump in which the dealer will have 5 cards in his hand do we need to consider cases in which the dealer has less than 5 cards and more than 0 cards any help would be appreciated
student,what might it mean if my playercpp file compiles on my computer on a um caen computer but wont compile when i submit to the autograder
student,i have searched the related questions but i am still confused about the order for example trump is hearts led suit is spades a is acespades b is nineheartsalthough its a trump card it is the smallest card of the player which one is bigger in the case of playing a hand led by spades
student,in function packinit what should i use when i cant open the file should i use exit1 or return
student,if the upcard is a 10 of hearts but the dealer is being forced to add it to their hand due to the screw the dealer rule then the trump suit will have been set to diamonds however addanddiscard only takes the upcard so how do you know that the trump suit in this case is diamonds not the suit of the upcard when it comes to figuring out the lowest card to discard
student,does anyone know how the course will be graded overall ie 90100 a 8590 a etc checked the syllabus and that only had the percentage for each work done but no grading scale available any help would be appreciated
student,the spec describes the strategy for playing as follows if a player can follow suit he plays the highest card that follows suit otherwise he plays the lowest card in his hand does that mean the player only ever plays a trump card if the led suit was a trump card
student,in the addanddiscard function assuming we are able to identify which card to add and which card to discard is there an expectation as to where we add the card for example do we have to add it at the beginning or end only and leave the rest of the cards minus the discarded card in the same order as before or can we simply replace the discarded card with the added card ie overwriting that element of the playerhand array to my knowledge the spec doesnt seem to specify this or whether it matters one way or the other
student,am i allowed to do this or is there a way around it
student,can i get some info as to what each of the test cases actually tests just seeing failed for one of them doesnt give me much to go off when all the cases i wrote pass
student,am i allowed to copy and paste the enums for card and suit from cardcpp into packcpp so i can still use them
student,i got a compilation error on this from the autograder even though it compiles correctly in the linux environment any ideas as to why
student,are we allowed to make a header file with some cards andor players to use in testing and just include it in the testcpp files and the submission
student,i know the rmes for playeraddanddiscard say to see the spec for determining which card to add and remove but i cant find where this is discussed can anyone help
student,for the playerplay card function i am getting a segmentation fault i am first checking to see if the card has the same suit as the suit of the led card then i am using cardcomparecardcheckplayerptrhanditrump if the suit is not the same i just dont understand the spec if a player can follow suit he can play the highest card that follows suit otherwise he plays the lowest card in his hand we did 3 compare functions which all determine different orderings so which one should we use
student,whenever i try to run cardtests it gives me a segmentation fault i know that usually this means i am trying to access an array out of bounds but even when i just have the skeleton of all of the functions it still says there is a segmentation fault any ideas
student,in the spec it says if the trump suit is order up during round one the dealer receives it what is it the upcard the spec also says he then discards the lowest card among his hand and the turn up what is the turn up
student,in the playermaketrump function the spec says during round two the player will order up the suit with the same color as the up card if he has one or more face cards of that suit in his hand does the left bower count as a face card of that suit for example the player has these cards in their hand jack of hearts and all other cards are spades if the upcard is a heart then in round 2 the player will consider ordering up diamonds do we count the jack of hearts as a face card of diamonds since its the left bower so basically would the player order up diamonds as trump or not
student,how should we terminate the program or cout error information when such cases happen thank you
student,in project 3 in playercpp bool playermaketrumpconst player playerptr const card upcard const player dealer int round suit orderupsuit i think theres a problem with const player dealer because if its round 1 and someone orders it up the dealer must receive the upcard and discard the lowest among his hand but declaring dealer as const cant make the change
student,how do we know if the player designated by playerptr chooses to order up or pass was considering using cin but it doesnt seem correct are we supposed to utilize another function
student,i submitted my project to the autograder and playertest00 had a compilation error i then tried compiling it in a caen environment and got this error message i made a helper function that removes a card by moving all of the cards after the unwanted card down one index to cover the unwanted card and then setting the last index to i then update the size of the hand does anyone know what this error could mean and how i could fix it thanks
student,im trying to run the make card command so i can compile and test it but i get the error make no rule to make target cardtests stop any suggestions on what is happening
student,nuff said
student,is there a logistics reason for only the submitting partner getting the email with the autograder scores or are both of us supposed to get the email
student,can someone please clarify how to use next to access cards within pack
student,for some reason im not passing the autograder test case for card ive every test combination i can think of does anyone have any suggestions for tests i could be missing thank you in advance
student,i am trying to use the open function to open packin which is passed in to packin as const so how am i supposed to convert it to a string using cstr when it is const i keep getting an error message that says i cant use cstr
student,im still unable to get anything to compile properly in the autograder and i get the following error message running test cases running test playertest00 compilation error running test packtest00 compilation error running test cardtest00 compilation error you passed 0 out of 3 test cases measuring 03 everything compiles properly when i run unit tests in caen is there something im missing about submitting things to the checkpoint im submitting the header files for player card and pack the cpp files for those 3 and the individual tests for all 3 any help would be appreciated
student,do we still have to make more test cases for packinit when there are already unit tests provided
student,hello i know this is kind of early to be asking this but i was wondering how the final grading is usually done in this class from the curve it seems it is graded on a curve what percentage of total class points usually puts you in the a range
student,effects player adds one card to hand and removes one card from hand see spec for determining which so if this function is called it is implied that one card should be discarded and the upcard should be added
student,i cant figure out how to access the suit of the same color as up card one of my ideas is to use the enum suit indices and do suit of upcard 2 to get the ordered up suit but this is problematic if the upcard has suit clubs or diamonds enum indices 2 and 3 since if you add 2 to those youd go outside the bounds of the enum is there another way to go about this
student,good evening i am confused about what we have to write for cardcpp i understand that cardh lists the procedural abstractions for a playing card are only files that we have to write for cardcpp the blank functions at the bottom of the cardcpp files as in void cardini tcard cardptr const char rank const char suit int cardcompare const card a const card b suit trump int cardcompare const card a const card b const card ledcard suit trump thank you very much
student,if spades is the trump suit r bower jack of spades l bower jack of clubs so after the r and l bowers akq10 and 9 of the trump suit comes the jack of diamonds and jack of hearts is the diamonds or the heart bigger
student,if you only have one card left in the deck and packdealone is called are you supposed to shuffle the deck and reset the pointer thanks
student,so im having trouble figuring out the pointer traversal with this one in order to use the next pointer dont you have to initialize it to the beginning of the cards array the problem is when i do this when i call the function it deals out the first card in the pack every time and never traverses to the next one is this the right approach if so what kind of strategy should i use to get around this
student,im failing my tests for playeraddcard and im not sure why i used a for loop to check each card in the hand for whether or not it is null the first time i come across a null card i assigned that position a new card and returned this clearly isnt the right way of thinking about it if im failing my tests is there a different way to do it where you dont have if the card null is that even legal
student,when will grades be posted for project 1
student,what will the order of cards be after playing a hand and before shuffling
student,can the pack file contain cards below 9 eg two of spades if so what should we do in this case since the card wouldnt be able to be used in the game and the pack would have less than 24 cards if it wasnt included the game wouldnt be able to be played with the pack
student,what is meant by an empty hand for playerinit would it be just an array of size 5 with unassigned elements or would having a hand with cards ranging from 2 to 8 also count as an empty hand since euchre only uses cards 9 to ace
student,how would you go about initializing the players name when the function is passed const char name and the struct player has an array of characters name do you need to iterate through the name passed to the function with a pointer assigning each character to the name array
student,i think that im conceptualizing the shuffle algorithm incorrectly is this what the spec meant the first line is the starting point and the last line is the shuffled deck i did this but i think i might be conceptualizing the algorithm incorrectly are these shuffling steps correct 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 1 2
student,what does this error mean
student,i cant seem to get the pack and player tests working for the autograder ive made many test cases for both files to the point where i cant figure out any more cases without falling out of the requirements listed in the rmes of the procedures i was able to pass all of the test cases i made but the autograder tests just wont pass has anyone managed to pass all of the autograder cases
student,what does this error mean error no operator matches these operands operand types are stdifstream stdstring i did the exactly same thing from the lecture note which is something similar to string word while filestream word
student,when initializing pack is next the first card in the deck
student,i thought i readheard somewhere that we are not supposed to pass arguments by reference in project 3 but i cant seem to find wherewhen this was specified can someone confirm whether or not this is the case thanks
student,in the spec it says the dealer will discard the lowest card of those already in his hand and the upcard does lowest refer only to rank and the suit order specified for the project or does it also take trump and led into account if so how do we consider trump suit if that is not passed into the function
student,we got an error when we submitted for the checkpoint but when we hit grade all all test cases are green indicating we passed so what could be the problem
student,is it okay to implement the shuffle function in a way such that it achieves the same effect but without actually swapping the two parts three times because i think i found a pattern
student,should our test cases be void functions
student,will i lose points if i do not use the included functionsie isrightbower in cardcpp and just do it myself
student,what do i need to includecopy into my packcpp file is it just packh or do i need to also include cardh or copy the enumerations or arrays
student,when the spec says the suit with the same color as the up card it means the suit with the same color but not the same suit correct on a related note consider the following example it is round 2 the up card was a heart and a players hand consists of the king of diamonds the king of hearts and three clubs the player didnt order up in round 1 because their hand only had one trump face card the king of hearts at this point does the player order up hearts or diamonds
student,ive been working on packinit for a really long time and im stuck i understand how to use fstreams but my problem is that im trying to set packptrcardsi cardinitcardptr rank suit but i dont know what cardptr to use can anyone help me figure out a better way of thinking about this
student,cardcpp in function ‘void cardinitcard const char const char’ cardcpp97 error expected initializer before ‘’ token cardcpp102 error expected initializer before ‘’ token make cardtests error 1 anyone have any thoughts
student,suppose player has 5 cards and we want to call playerinit to empty his hand how do we make a card equal to nothing playerptrhand
student,im working on packinit and im having a hard time conceptualizing how to set packptrcards what youre reading in i think part of my problem might be i dont really understand whats in the file what are we reading in card names whats the format
student,not exactly sure what to do here
student,is there a function that returns the length of a c string or is there a way to convert a c string to a string so that i can use the strsize function
student,so i was wondering what happens if we do not pass the published test cases for our code by wednesday when the checkpoint is due also do we need to have created test cases for our functions by wednesday as well thanks
student,so my partner and i are working on the project on ubuntu and we ran into the issue with the code with int cardcompare const card a const card b const card ledcard suit trump as when we try to run a test with it it somehow changes the inputs and outputs from all of our previous tests making them wrong ie tests that normally output a are outputting b however when we do not include tests for this cardcompare the tests all work as the should be when we tested it on the caen computers the code worked as it should including the issues with the cardcompare does anyone know what the issue might lay in
student,i have finished the shuffle function but i do not know how to test it a point in the right direction would be great
student,are we allowed to use cardinit in packinit
student,im a bit confused as to where to start project3 i downloaded all of the files and copied cardcppstarter into my own file cardcpp i read through cardcpp to see what has been written and when i get to the bottom three functions says implement me but it appears that these three functions are already written in the file above for this am i just writing test cases for these functions if not what does it mean implement me
student,will there still be office hours during fall break also will the answer keys to the practice exams be released
student,i seem to have a problem getting the pack test case and the player test case to pass the autograder even though all pass the test cases i made after i submitted to the autograder and failed i searched through piazza to find anything i might have done wrong i fixed a couple things and uploaded again i still failed then i thought to just start programming the game portion which i stayed up last night doing when i find something that goes wonky i know its that function that is the problem there was a huge flaw in this approach i successfully coded the game simulator without changing any of the player or pack code diff returned nothing for 00correct and 01correct instead of programming i could have stood in line for smash bros midnight release but i regret nothing especially considering i dont have a 3ds so my question is are there functions you found hard to implement or had some special test case that took time to figure out how to make it pass perhaps that could give me a start as to where i should start looking im just not sure exactly what more to test
student,perhaps im misunderstanding packinit but ive made it so that cards is an array that holds each card in it with each card having a rank and a suit when using the original code of card firstcard packnext assertcardcomparefirstcard ninespades 0 it gives me a segmentation fault core dumped however when comparing card ninespades to packcards0 in other words the first card and asserting that theyre equal it passes fine thus im not really understanding whats going on here somehow next isnt working for me and it might be because i misunderstanding the function can someone explain to me how next is supposed to work behind the scenes or why im getting a segmentation fault when using next thanks
student,what is the difference between const char rank and const char rank
student,so to be clear packreset only resets the next pointer to the first card in the pack in its current order yes so if i call packreset on an unshuffled pack the next pointer will be set to the nine of spades while calling it on a shuffled version of packin would assign next to the first card in the shuffled deck queen of spades if im not mistaken is that correct
student,card card2 packptr next i want packptr to point to the card pointed to by next and set this equal to a card ive tried about 10 different ways and i still cant get it packcpp107 error expected unqualifiedid before u2018u2019 token packcpp107 error u2018nextu2019 was not declared in this scope
student,do we need to have our own test cases written for the 109 checkpoint or do the cpp files just need to pass the prewritten tests
student,how do we convert an enum to string
student,should playermaketrump deal with the dealer picking up the card that is ordered up and discarding his other card when the player decides to order up
student,can we use a goto statement in project 3
student,i think im confusing myself a bit if i have a pointer bar and right now it points to variable foo if i wanted to change the variable that it pointed to would i just say bar newvariable
student,hello im having trouble understanding the purpose of screw the dealer where the dealer has to assign the orderupsuit in the same color suit of the suit of the upcard wouldnt the alternative be that a player other than the dealer does the same thing provided they have at least one face card in the opposite color of the suit of the upcard isnt the outcome the same in both cases
student,hello i am confused on how we are supposed to determine card value i know how to play euchre so obviously trump suit will have higher value than other suits but say for example spades is trump then would the queen of hearts and the queen of diamonds have the same value or do non trump suits have a specific order for this project
student,hi im trying to use strcmp to compare the rank we are given to a string but it keeps saying strcmp isnt a function we did include cstring so i am not sure why it isnt working
student,does anyone know what this means linker command failed with exit code 1 i dont even know where to look
student,i submitted my file to the autograder containing the 4 listed files and had an error happen saying error submission archive is missing the file cardtestscpp you have not been charged a submission are we supposed to be submitting this file also
student,i was wondering do we have to have in account of ledcard winning when all 3 of the cards are played or is it just between carda and cardb winning
student,so me and my partner wrote the cardinit function but were confused on how const affects the variables because we used a similar reference as the original cardinit function did so were not sure if we approached the problem correctly
student,im having trouble accessing a specific card in the deck in the packcpp functions im trying to use the syntax packptrcardsi since cards is an array contained in packptr but i get a compiler error can anyone correct me
student,can i use a function i wrote in cardcpp in packcpp
student,at the bottom of the given test cases it says cardinit unit tests these tests will pass once you code void cardinitcard cardptr rank rank suit suit cardinittwospades two spades asserttwospadesrank two twospadessuit spades the lines that confuse me are these tests will pass once you code void cardinitcard cardptr rank rank suit suit but isnt void cardinitcard cardptr rank rank suit suit a function they coded for us already shouldnt it say void cardinitcard cardptr const char rank const char suit which is the function they then list right below the comments thanks
student,in the spec it says in addition to being ordered by rank cards are also ordered by suit diamonds first then clubs hearts and spades under the heading the play in the spec it states a trick is won by the highest trump or if it contains no trump by the highest card of the suit led so if each turn has a lead card that determines the win im a bit confused why card order matter
student,hello i was wondering whether passing all labs during the semester is necessary to earn the 5 of the points that is earned from labs for our final grade will failing one or two still allow us to earn all these points thanks
student,what do we really need to have done for the checkpoint the answers at 697 and 731 seem to contradict each other
student,in the spec it says during round one a player will order up if he has two or more trump face cards in his hand i was wondering if the dealer is making the decision whether to pick up the face up card or not does he consider it as a card in his hand for example if the dealer has one trump face card in his hand and the up card is also a trump face card will he order up trump
student,im trying to complie packtestscpp but i get the error error cstlib no such file or directory it seemed odd to me that the complier would be unable to find cstlib so i wrote a simple hello world program and tried it out and again same issue is anyone else having this problem or know what to do about it
student,im not sure what to change other than initializing the hand size to 0 i know that cards each have a rank and type and if none of the cards in a hand exist then im not sure how to initialize that accordingly
student,when i submitted my checkpoint file to the autograder the results said there was a compiler error for packtest00 and playertest00 but cardtest00 passed they all compile fine when i compile them with the test files given to us and they pass all of the unit test cases given them i really dont see what could be breaking the code with just the init functions in pack and player did anyone else run into this problem also are all the pack files formatted the same way as the packin file ie each line is rank of suit
student,hello how can i convert an enum value to its underlying integer thanks
student,does the card being added to the players hand need to become the last card in the hand or is it okay for it to be added at any place in the hand
student,im confused as to the suit order for cardcompareconst card a const card b const card ledcard suit trump is it trump suit then led card suit then remaining suits in given order or is it led card suit trump suit remaining suits in given order ie if i passed in a ten of hearts and jack of spades and the led card was a queen of hearts and trump was spades which should win
student,hi there i was just curious about the enforcement of 80 characters for one line of code many of the comments code in cardcppstarter is 80 characters and a function call such as int cardcompareconst card a const card b const card ledcard suit trump is over 80 characters as well is this a problem or should we just ignore it thanks
student,how do we convert a string to an array of characters
student,what is the type of the content in packin is it string or char thank you
student,im a bit confused about what is meant by upcard vs what is meant by orderupsuit thats passed in this function my understanding is that the player looks at the suit of the up card and returns true or false depending on the cards in their hand and the current round does that mean that the suit of the up card is also passed separately as orderupsuit if thats the case i dont understand why we need to be changing orderupsuit depending on whether its true or false
student,im testing my cardcompare and its messing up somewhere where i think it should not lets say clubs are trump im comparing the ace of spades and the king of diamonds niether card is trump so the ranking should go off of suit and that means the king of diamonds should be ranked higher shouldnt it
student,does anyone know how to fix xcode having errors with duplicate int main any time i have more than one file with int main in my folder i get an error if i comment out all but one file with int main it runs okay anyone else have similar issues
student,in this function do we have to design it so that unrealistic events may take place like even though impossible in the actual game should my code consider for example that both a and b are right bowers so in this case 0 should be returned hope that makes sense
student,hi im looking for a partner for project 3 email me at kajudgeumichedu if you are looking for a partner too kiley judge
student,has the postlab survey been released yet i dont think ive gotten an email about it
student,hi i noticed while browsing ctools that there was an announcement on september 29 two days ago that reads there has been a minor change to cardcppstarter please download a fresh copy of the file is this update critical i dont know if i have the old version or the new version but i already finished writing all of the code in cardcpp and formatting its style to be consistent with my own style id rather not redownload if the change isnt important
student,will we be able to use notes and material from lectureour projects for reference on the first exam
student,player 1 has 4 cards jack of clubs jack of spades queen of spades ace of spades the led card has spades as the suit and the trump is clubs would player 1 then play the jack of spades instead of the ace of spades in other words does the trump suits order extend into the led suit
student,i do not understand how to get a const char pointer into an enum ive referred to the other piazza posts and am still confusedive converted the string that the pointer points to two or three into an integer because i thought you could set enums equal to integers but that is giving me a compiler error and i am very confused i could go through and change all the strings to capital letters using if statements but it seems like there has to be a more concise way to accomplish this
student,i have copied the code from lecture with file io and im getting this error packcpp19 error aggregate ‘stdifstream filestream’ has incomplete type and cannot be defined after some googling i found some answers saying i need to include fstream is this correct in the skeleton of the file provided there is only include iostream
student,in the project spec it says that the dealer is to pick up the lowest card among the 5 cards heshe already has and the upcard however the function description for playeraddand discard seems to suggest that one card is always discarded from the hand regardless of whether the upcard is higher or lower is this logic taken care of elsewhere or are we to assume that the upcard is always picked up
student,do we leave that in the given functions in cardcpp that we have to implement
student,im a bit confused as to how i would call and therefore test the cardcompareconst card a const card b suit trump function specifically the last parameter would trump be passed in as a c string or as a c string so would it be something like cardcomparea b spades thanks
student,i received the lab 4 pre lab survey but have not received the lab 4 post lab survey has the post lab survey come out yet
student,if neither a nor b are trump and the trump of ledcard is used does the jack of ledcards suit act like a right bower and does the same suit of that color produce a left bower jack for instance if im comparing a jack of hearts and a queen of clubs and the ledcard is a 9 of diamonds which card would win
student,int cardcompareconst card a const card b suit trump int cardcompareconst card a const card b const card ledcard suit trump so is the 2nd function used to compare two cards after the leader leads a card the 1st function is used to compare two cards while the leader decides upon a lead card
student,are the blue review videos always from professor deorios lecture i was looking back at the lecture for the 29th and it was a different professor the lecture slides and video didnt exactly match up so i couldnt follow the lecture comprehensively
student,i have read the specification but i am still confused about packshuffle in this function do i need to do cutting and swapping one time or three times thanks
student,cardcpp in function u2018int cardcompareconst card const card suitu2019 cardcpp118 error no match for u2018operatoru2019 in u2018 a2 trumpu2019 cardcpp124 error no match for u2018operatoru2019 in u2018 a2 trumpu2019 cardcpp124 error expected u2018u2019 before u2018u2019 token how do we compare a suit and a trump suit my program was able to compare two suits but i got the aforementioned error when i tried comparing a suit and trump suit
student,is there a specific link that were supposed to use to download the files from google drive or do we download the files one by one
student,hello sorry to be a pain but is it possible that we can get the correct order of cards after invoking packshuffle once on the pack that we initialized from packin if not i totally understand and i will just write it out myself i only ask because it could take a while for me to figure out the correct order on paper thanks
student,in the spec on page 3 it says if the trump suit is ordered up during round one the dealer receives it he then discards the lowest card among his hand and the turnup for a final total of five cards this sentence makes it sound like the dealer discards two cards the lowest one and the up card but if someone orders up a suit doesnt everyone have 5 cards in their hands at this point then the dealer would be left with 4 cards after discarding 2 cards is this merely a typo
student,in function u2018void cardinitcard rank suitu2019 cardcpp44 error redefinition of u2018void cardinitcard rank suitu2019 cardh48 error u2018void cardinitcard rank suitu2019 previously defined here i got these error messages without even touching any of the files this was downloaded from the submittargz
student,rank two cardrank two i am trying to do the first function still but it it quite difficult because structs havent been covered yet why wont this compile in my program
student,do we need to have made test cases for when we turn the files due at the checkpoint submission
student,in the cardinit function when i try to assign the rank and suit i get an error saying that it cant convert const char to rank and suit im not entirely clear on this but it seems like cardptrrank expects a type of rank and the same for suit but i dont know how to turn the const char rank and suit into rank and suit type is there some sort of conversion function or am i doing this completely wrong
student,for this function are we to compare a and b against each other then the highest of those two against ledcard or compare all 3 together i am a little confused about how to approach this one and how to compare them for the proper return thanks
student,in the project spec it reads for the midproject checkpoint submit the following files to the autograder in a tar archive called checkpointsubmittargz cardcpp packcpp playercpp grouptxt the card pack and player components should pass the published unit tests i have a few questions about this 1 do the card pack and player components only need to pass the published unit tests the unit tests given in the test files are very basic and dont even test all of the functions which is intended of course since i am supposed to write the rest of the tests is it a correct statement that as long as my implementation passes these given unit tests it will receive full credit for the checkpoint 2 when do we turn in the completed cardtestscpp packtestscpp and playertestscpp files these dont appear in the file lists for either the checkpoint or the final submission in the project spec 3 are we being graded for style in the checkpoint or only in the final submission
student,just trying to wrap my head around what each of the cpp files we write will do correct me if i am wrong gamecpp this will contain code for the rules of the game and therefore will decide the next move in the simulation euchrecpp this runs the simulation and output the results based on the interactions between the other cpp files cardcpp contains code for the initialization of cards and their rankings packcpp contains code for operations like shuffling the cards playercpp contains code for operations dealing with the status of the players and their hands like winning a trick etc
student,i just want to make sure my code is wrong not my testing to test cardinitcard cardptr const char rank const char suit should we be calling something like cardinittwospades two spades the same thing was given to us for the other cardinit point being im confused as to what a potential input would be for const char ranksuit if not a string thanks
student,in the cardinit function were supposed to initialize the place that cardptr points to to a specific rank and suit but i dont understand how the pointer can point to a rank and a suit how can it point to more than one thing at a time
student,should we be creating test cases for cardcomparesuit i tried to test it but since it is not in the header file cardtests did not recognize it as defined in its scope however defining it in cardtests leads to a compiler error of being defined in two spaced and it cannot be deleted from cardcpp because i need it defined since i use it in cardcompare later on
student,in the provided file at the end of the tests it says pack test pass should we change this to card test pass
student,if were comparing just the suit then if the trump is hearts and the two cards passed in were ace of diamonds and jack of diamonds it should return 0 even if the jack of diamonds is left bower
student,would we have to use strcmp to compare strings instead of the operator
student,for example if we needed the suit of a cardptr should we use cardpty suit or cardgetsuit do we ever use
student,cardptrrank rank cardptrsuit suit what is the operator
student,in the cardcompare function already given with an input of two cards why do they multiply the rank by suitsize which is always 4 what does this accomplish
student,can someone explain how to go about this function i am confused how to access the first element in our pack with the argument packptr
student,in the spec it says if a player can follow suit he plays the highest card that follows suit otherwise he plays the lowest card in his hand just to make sure im not missing something the player would not play a trump card if he cannot follow suit
student,in the specs it says that cards are ordered by suit first then rank so for example if we are comparing 2 cards and they are of the same suit then we should compare them by rank but in the specs for cardcompare it says that we should return 0 if the cards are equal i cant think of a situation where any 2 cards would be equal thanks
student,in the playerinit function it asks us to initialize the player with an empty hand would this consist of making dumby cards and populating the array or is there a different method to initialize an array of cards to be empty
student,not to rush into things but i usually do my labs before my discussion because i still dont have a computer and since my labs are late in the week i donät worry as much about having to write and type up code and test it at the last minute so far i think the labs have been posted on sunday i was wondering when this weeks lab would be posted so i can get started before the end of the week
student,is there an alternative to coding and compiling in linux for a pc user i dont want to have to log in to a remote site everytime
student,hi is there any gathering where the card game will be played so i can learn please if there is any let me knw thanks
student,is there a terminal command like the first two projects that allows us to download all the files from the project folder from ctools into our directory instead of one at a time or did i miss it in the spec
student,for downloading this file my computer is struggling to download it and put it into my cardcpp file through my ide i am using visual studio is anyone else having this problem if not what can i do to fix it
student,if hearts is trump would 6 of spades 6 of diamonds 6 of clubs
student,in this file at the bottom it says add your test cases here but it looks like there are unit tests above it for the functions that we have to write obviously they are incomplete but i was confused about why we must put our test cases at the bottom rather than with the other tests above am i missing something
student,hello im having trouble initializing a card ive experiemented with trying to assign the suit and rank to that card object with no luck because its a const char im unsure how to assign it maybe im having java stuck in my head and thats why its not working thanks
student,i just realized that i might have made my makefilegrouptxt incorrectly instead of doing tar p2cpp p2testscpp grouptxt tar czf submittargz p2cpp p2testscpp grouptxt i think i might have forgotten to write grouptxt in the first line but i did include my name and my partners name in the cpp files what do i do is there anyway to fix it
student,was this function intentionally left out of cardh if so what are the specsrmes for it o thanks
student,there are some skeleton functions inside of cardcpp that simple have implement me assert0 what is the assert0 for can we remove it when we actually start to define the functions or is it meant to be there thanks
student,so with the exception of the trump suit and the left bower all other cards follow the published suit order is any special consideration given to cards of the suit of the same color as trump aside from the left bower
student,for addingdiscarding it says that the player will discard the lowest card i assume that if the player has 9 j a in trump and 10 q out of trump the player will discard the 10 not trump and not the 9 trump am i correct in assuming this
student,im an avid euchre player and know all of the rules as i was reading through i noticed that you added an addition rule in addition to being ordered by rank cards are also ordered by suit diamonds first then clubs hearts and spades in what situation does this even take place im assuming that trump is still the number one suit no matter what is this just incase different offtrump cards are played for example if a spades is lead and the first 3 people play spades but the 4th player doesnt have a spade and coincidentally plays a heart assuming neither are trump the player who plays the heart wins even though they technically wouldnt in the real euchre game
student,i am just wondering what is the difference between pass by reference and pointers to me it seems pointers do exactly what passing by reference does if they do have a big difference can you explain please
student,effects returns zero if cards are equal a value greater than zero indicates that a has a higher value than b a value less than zero indicates that b has a higher value than a does it matter how much bigger or smaller the int returned is or will later functions only consider if its zero greater than zero or less than zero im not completely sure what value i should be returning if one of the cards is for example the right bower a very large number or just 1 or 1
student,how do we interact with pack in the test file there is packcards packsize 1 or packnext when i am compliling i get request for member ‘cards’ in ‘packptr’ which is of nonclass type ‘pack’ is this something we must add or am i confused
student,i am not sure where to begin in project 3 do you guys give us a function somewhere that randomly assigns cards to the 4 players
student,in the spec it mentions the file playercpp but the file is not in the tar or the google drive i know that this can just be implemented by making a file called playercpp but i want to make sure that there isnt a missing file
student,i cant seem to find the function prototype in cardh for the cardcomparesuit function to be implemented in cardcpp am i missing something
student,so fellow anons who like myself failed to achieve and had my project fail on me in a desperate last minute struggle what have we learned from this for the only option when met with failure is to think upon ones actions and learn how to improve upon it 1 start earlier not 5 days before due date and even with that allowing distractions and time off 2 more tests extensive really means extensive i must break the code 3 seek help throwing my brain against my monitor does little the fix the code that worked on paper but not on the compiler anyone else willing to discard their pride and admit their shame anonymously of course so that they can like the phoenix rise stronger and better
student,so in the spec it states that you must test each function at least once if we only put one test case would we get docked points
student,the inserttree function requires a sorted binary tree however im curious to know if we need to create a function to check if the entered binary tree is sorted do we need to do so would appreciate some quick help thank you to whoever helps
student,before submitting the final version i commented the project however i did not add comments to p2cpp but i added comments to p2testscpp because p2cpp functions are already commented in p2h file i did not think we would be required to write comments is this acceptable
student,im just going through my code before i finally submit it and i realized that i never followed the protip 2 about not putting all the test cases in int main i didnt understand how to put them into separate functions so i followed the example given and listed every test case after that first given one is this okay
student,if so i have a few questions 1neither my computer nor the computers in the fishbowl can open the makefile file what kind of file is it does it need to be opened in linux 2should i replace the files already in the targz folder with the edited p2testscpp and p2cpp thanks
student,no match for opperator in stdoperator im getting a huge list of errors but they all go away if i comment out include iostream incorrectly i dont know what is causing it
student,does anyone know what the test cases 7a and 6a are its kinda hard to fix whats wrong when i dont know whats wrong
student,do the both of us my partner and me have to submit the project or do they just grade either of ours that submitted last
student,after i created the file to submit after typing in the make tar command i submitted my project to the autograder i recieved the following message your submittargz file failed to extract properly make sure that the following command successfully unpacks your archive tar xzvf submittargz you have not been charged a submission make sure that your archive included p2cpp p2testscpp and grouptxt i cant figure out what is wrong but after i input make tar i get the message tar czf submittargz p2cpp p2testscpp is there some difference between czf and xzvf like the autograder said i should have
student,the effects clause of the containedby function says to return true if a is covered by b shouldnt we be writing a function to see whether its contained by b why are contained by and covered by being used interchangeably
student,just want to make sure i have this right an empty tree is covered by anyall other trees but an empty tree does not cover any other tree unless the other is empty as well
student,i have some really long lists and a ton of test cases i check all of these by hand because it is much faster than having to make an actual list or tree of what i actually have the project spec specifies we should have at least 1 test case and it should use assert is is acceptable to have 1 test case using assert and multiple not using assert
student,im working in xcode and trying to add asserts for all my test cases for my inserttree test cases though i am failing the asserts even though my expected and actual outputs look like they match exactly does anyone know why the asserts would fail when they shouldnt be this is a screenshot of what i get in xcode
student,do the tree functions need rmes if they have already been given to us
student,every time i submit do i have to run the make tar command to update my files or do i only run that command when making the submit file for the first time
student,since traversal is not a tail recursive function am i allowed to create a helper function for it with another variable being passed not by refference
student,when compiling my code i get the error righthand operand of comma has no effect 3 times for line1 say this is my function functionlistt list1 listt list2 listt list3 treet tree1 treet tree2 bool one line 1 is return list1 list2 list3 tree1 tree1 true what does this error mean
student,when i submitted my projected with the grouptxt file only containing my uniqname and with the update to tar it still ends up taking 4 points off how do i fix it so that i can get full credit
student,is it legit to call my traversal function on my tree and use the sum function on that to add all the elements in my tree
student,i just finished up the lab however im still a bit fuzzy on one thing the typedef what was the purpose of using that and how exactly did it clean things up basically what i want to know is what the advantage was from using it
student,is there any way other than looping through listmake to create an expected list when comparing that and the functions result listt expectedlist 0 1 2 doesnt work
student,i wrote my program using visual express and when i opened it in vim m appeared on every line will i get penalized for this
student,for my traversal function in each recursive step i create a new left and right subtree then call the traversal function for the left subtree add the element of the tree to my list and then call the traversal function for the right subtree my base case is when the list passed to traversal is empty where it returns 0 and presumably goes back up to the previous stack frame and continues with adding the element and calling traversal to the right subtree when inputting the tree given in the project spec where the traversal should be 2 3 4 5 i get only 4 ive tried stepping through my traversal code and i cant figure out whats wrong i dont know if its something to do with my list being overwritten each step i have a helper function with the list being passed each time as an argument so i dont see why it would be overwritten each time
student,so im working on testing my project right now and ive tried and successfully compiled my project i receive bash41 back but i cant run it after i type in p2tests nothing happens whats going on
student,for inserttree and for traversaltree im looking to build my tree back up from the bottom in another piazza question for inserttree they said this was the best way im confused on how im supposed to build it back up when there is no recollection of what else is in the tree i am recursively changing what the value of tree is so when i try to build my tree back up there is no other tree that i can work back up i hope this makes sense
student,for the inserttree function do we need to account for cases in which the user passes in an element which cannot be added in to any place in the tree or can we assume that only elements that have a logical place to be inserted into the tree will be passed in thanks
student,when calling helper function the in the original functions ex sum calling sumhelper would it be preferred that i describe the additional argument variables in the the original functions call or above the helper function definition is there a convention
student,if i have a helper function i want to be tail recursive and in the recursive call for it i use listmakeelt list as one of the arguments in the call does that mean that the function is no longer tail recursive since im calling another function after the recursive call
student,just wondering is it okay to write the test functions with both cout display results and assert will it upset the autograder
student,do both people in a group have to submit the project to receive credit
student,how will p2testscpp be graded will we be expected to test for every possible case as in stress tests boundary tests etc or will we simply be graded on completion and or style
student,is it okay to use a while loop in a function as a counter to measure the numbers of elements in a list
student,every time i try to compile my code with my fib and fibtail functions i get this p2cpp in function ‘int fibtailint’ p2cpp256 error control reaches end of nonvoid function p2cpp in function ‘int fibint’ p2cpp227 error control reaches end of nonvoid function does anyone know what this means andor how to fix it
student,sorry if this has been answered before do partners get 6 submits in total or is 3 in total for us as well thanks
student,what does 14 refer to function 14
student,for our helper functions is it acceptable if our rme is essentially the same as the one given for the main function in p2h also is it acceptable to use the rme given for each function in p2h
student,i am getting an error when running my filter test case that says terminate called after throwing an instance of listexception error empty list i know this means that im putting an empty list into listrest which is not allowed however in my filter function during each recursive step i take out the first element using listfirst and set aside the rest using listrest how can i tell my function to stop once it has tested the last element without calling listrest and seeing if its empty
student,why isnt the tree with just the 5 as the elt covered by the parent tree
student,just wondering if im calling a list function inside my tailrecursive function is it still considered tailrecursive function for example int funcalistt l int a int results ifa 0 return results else return funcalistrestl a1 results listfirstl
student,how can i run my main function and display my test case in linux
student,when we write test cases for the two functions taking function pointers are we to write sample functions ie sum multiplication evenodd filters etc within p2tests so that we can direct our pointer variable to those functions otherwise if i just write functionptr fn then the program wont compile since fn is not a recognized function within p2testscpp
student,is this normal if our tree output for the insert function appears this way it seems that the left child for the number 3 does not appear however is that just because the formatting of the numbers are close to one another 4 2 5 1 3
student,we dont have to write rmes for the helper functions we use correct thanks
student,if you were to call insertlistfirst second 0 im assuming the correct output is second first or basically appendsecond first assuming this is correct can we address this case in our insertlist function by calling append i checked the specs and it seems that its valid for n to equal 0
student,im having an issue where when i test the traversal function the program gets aborted because one of the left or right subtrees is empty so the function cant be called again but i have two base cases one checks if the left substree is empty and the other checks the right subtree if either are empty an empty list gets returned should i just check if the tree is empty by itself and maybe in the return statement refer to the left and right subtrees
student,i ran through the autograder and i failed tests 5a and 1a i know there is no way of knowing which function is which but is there any way i can go about figuring out what is going wrong in any other way then i have for all of the list functions sum through chop i have used a list of 5 elements used a list of one element and used a list of the empty list and all my functions passed all of those for the fibonacci tests i ran through 3 different values including the 2 initial values of 0 and 1 and one value further out in the series for all of the tree functions i did at least 3 tests for eachin most cases more including the empty tree for every scenario in each of them i dont know what else to try in tests
student,i have been adding my tests to p2testscpp one by one and so far sum and product have worked but when i added my reverse test i get a compiler error that is a massive bunch of nonsense i have narrowed it down to two lines in my test that cout the expected and actual lists cout expected list listcorrect endl cout actual list actualreverse endl when i cut out these lines no error add them back in and error i have no idea whats going wrong
student,how does the autograder checks the test functions i have some extra functionsto create new trees etc will they cause any problems
student,ive got what i think is the recursive part of traversal but i cant figure out what my base case should be i had a base case that should have worked but when i ran my code i got treeexception what error empty tree
student,when compiling my code g returns many many errors along the lines of p2testscpp360 error no match for ‘operator’ in ‘stdoperator with traits stdchartraitscharstdbasicostreamchar stdchartraitschar stdcout const charcorrect list listprintconst listtconst listt b’ im pretty sure these errors are coming from the listprint and treeprint functions as each of these errors has some mention of them ive done include p2h and at this point ive no idea how to fix it any help would be appreciated
student,when i compile my code with the werror flag all my helper functions return an error that says error control reaches end of nonvoid function p2cpp in function u2018listt filterhelperlistt bool int listtu2019 im not exactly sure what the problem is because these are only warnings
student,i cant compile my function and im not sure why the files are definitely in my folder and ive created my make tar but the autograder wont grade it and compiling with g wont work what am i doing wrong
student,i wrote my code in xcode and were trying to compile it in terminal now because the autograder couldnt compile our code but when i try and run it it gives me literally thousands of errors saying error stray 1 or the like in the files that were written for us anyone know whats going on
student,is it required to write an rme for each of our required functions
student,hello so does it matter if we are using our specific test cases in the test case functions will the cases you guys put in be affected by our test case functions because i dont want my specific test cases to interfere with the test cases used to grade our functions im literally asserting my test cases expected output and actual output in the function
student,my submittargz file failed to compile when i submitted it to the autograder however it compiles runs and tests against my own test cases in p2tests fine on caen linux currently i have moved the coveredby function from p2cpp to p2testscpp for testing purposes since coveredby is a function that i wrote myself its not included in p2h meaning if i include coveredby only in p2cpp and not in p2testscpp my test code cannot recognize coveredby could the fact that my coveredby function is commented out in p2cpp and placed in p2testscpp be the reason that my files dont compile in the autograder i know i can try uncommenting coveredby in p2cpp and taking it out of p2tests and resubmitting but i want to avoid that if possible since if unsuccessful it wastes one of my three autograder submissions
student,when submitting to the autograder i pass all of the tests besides the 6a and 7a which say agerr which i assume means it is an autograder error does anybody know what that might mean or how to fix it
student,do we have to declare the functions we make in p2testscpp static
student,is there any clue or hint that you guys could give me about fold i have no idea how to do it ive tried forever
student,in project 2 do we have to use assert in every test the coding part of instruction say we dont have to use assert the testing part say we should use assert i am a little confused
student,when i compile my p2cpp i get pages of undefined reference to recursivelistrecursivelist i included p2h and recursiveh at the top of my file so i dont know where the error might be coming from
student,can someone clearly explain how to submit if i made my files in xcode
student,will we lose points if we do not use functions for our test cases
student,i dont know if im being remarkably stupid but i have no idea how to run my tests i have some test cases made in p2testscpp but how do i actually run them typing make p2tests into the command line compiles everything correctly but there is no cout output from p2testscpp like there should be
student,even when i compile p2testcpp without all my test code the compiler says undefined reference to all the functions i am using what should i do
student,how do we submit our final project not to the autograder the one we want to be graded
student,i submitted my project 2 to the autograder but when i check the details of my submission tests 6a and 7a return agerr but there is no indicator of what type of error it is on the bottom what is agerr
student,i am unable to log in to caen computers when i tried to log into a linux one it said authentication failed how can i have my uniqname authenticated
student,when some of the functions rmes specify that n must be less than the number of elements in a certain list etc do we need to check for that in our code or does that mean it is assumed that the requirement will be filled when our code is tested against the autograder thanks
student,i never got an email for a prepostlab survey for lab 3 are we supposed to get one or is it not required for lab 3
student,if i use a helper function to implement tail recursion is the regular function restricted to only calling the helper function or can the regular function do other things as well in other words am i allowed to use a helper function to do most of the work tailrecursively of course and then modify the helper functions result in the regular function before returning it
student,the audio for the video is not working is it possible to fix it
student,ok i made the submittargz with all three files in it but when i go to auto grader and click browse to search for this file i cant find it im guessing because its in my caen environment only how do i transport the file to be on my mac so i can submit to auto grader thanks
student,when i try to run lab03 using lab03cpp it says permission denied how do you test the map function in main
student,are we required to implement the function recursively or we can choose to do it iteratively
student,since most of my test functions are actually procedures do i still have to write rmes for those in my p2testscpp file
student,did they get cancelled
student,when will the lecture from 0924 be uploaded section 002
student,im confused as to how i can traverse the tree in a list until i find the spot for the number and then build it again without using a helper function i feel like i would need an extra argument just to help me go through the list
student,i am having trouble printing my trees for test cases i get the error p2tests binarytreecpp287 void binarytreeprint const assertion false failed when i go into the binarytreecpp and comment out the assertfalse statement the tree will print like normal any help would be appreciated
student,so i caught myself using functions from both recursive and recursivelist for example i used listisemptylist and listisempty they both do the same thing but from a style standpoint should i be using listisemptylist or listisempty
student,hi i had a question about chop and the unsigned int n as an input can someone explain the reasoning behind why int n is unsigned what should happen in our code if a negative number is entered i understand that a negative will wrap around but im not sure how our code should accommodate for that thank you
student,whenever i try to compile my code the terminal spits out this error no rule to make target p2cpp needed by p2tests stop this is wierd since i made sure that p2h is included in p2tests whats going on
student,when i call traversal on the following tree i get this list which is correct aside from the zeros any help on how i can prevent my function from adding the zeros into the list 5 3 4 2 1 0 2 0 3 0 1 0 5 0 4 0
student,i made my both the files we have to submit in xcode i can submit them each individually to the auto grader but i dont think that will work how to i combine them and submit the one file that this auto grader seeks thanks
student,for the tree functions specifically when calling our helper functions are we allowed to use pass by reference
student,hi i have finished my work and are trying to make tar but it says that no rule to make target grouptxt needed by tar stop im sure im in the correct directory i have used ls to check that how can i fix it thank you
student,i was under the impression that if our files dont compile submits wont be used however i submitted and although it failed to compile my submits are being used also why is my file not compiling below is the ag output running test cases running test 7a test case 7a failed to compile running test 6a test case 6a failed to compile running test 5a test case 5a failed to compile running test 4a test case 4a failed to compile running test 3a test case 3a failed to compile running test 2a test case 2a failed to compile running test 1a test case 1a failed to compile running test 14a test case 14a failed to compile you passed 0 out of 8 test cases measuring 08
student,how are the test cases being graded
student,i have the containedbya b checking to make sure a is covered by all of b or any subtree of b i have the coveredbya b checking to make sure a is covered by b im having trouble figuring out how to check if part of a is empty and if so how to implement this in the function if i have it return true when b is empty it may incorrectly say b covers it when it does not
student,is there a way for us to tell which autograder test case tests which function for instance my partner i failed test cases 7a and 5a but dont know which functions those test cases apply to
student,as soon as it gets to my code in my function that tests the sum function i get this error terminate called after throwing an instance of listexception what error empty list im not really sure what to do about this
student,if two lists first and second and the integer 0 are passed to insertlist in that order should the function return the list second first
student,i have tried so many different steps on paper in order to do an inorder traversal of the elements left to right in a tree but no matter what i try i cant figure it out the first element needed in the list is obvious to me go all the way left and return that elt into the list from there i have no clue what to do any help would be great thanks
student,hi there i cant download project 2 files from google drive it says sorry you cant view or download this file at this time too many users have viewed or downloaded this file recently please try accessing the file again later if the file you are trying to access is particularly large or is shared with many people it may take up to 24 hours to be able to view or download the file if you still cant access a file after 24 hours contact your domain administrator can this be fixed soon thank you
student,im writing tests for our functions and i keep getting errors for this line assertlistb reverselista the error is saying no match for operator in listb reverselistt any ideas on how to fix this
student,why is it named containedby when it could be named coverby coverby is more specific requiring that the root topmost element is the same for a and b and then moving downwards from there however containedby isnt as specific it cant be any tree in b for tree a thus why is it named containedby if the specs says that it returns true for if its coverby thanks
student,in classwe talked about const char p and we cant pass p to functions that expect to change the data that p points to however i am confused by the following example char b const char c which of the following statements will generate compiler warnings or errors a b c b c b if i understand correctly const char c means we cant change the character that c points to but that doesnt mean we cant change the address namely i think cb is legal so what is the problem are we facing here
student,i open up terminal on my mac and login then i go to my eecs280 folder and type in the code to get the files for the project which is wget googldn42oo o tar xzk and then this pops up my question is why and how to fix this thanks bash41 wget googldn42oo o tar xzk 20140924 152854 httpgoogldn42oo resolving googl 7412523066 7412523067 7412523069 connecting to googl741252306680 connected http request sent awaiting response 301 moved permanently location httpsdrivegooglecomucexportdownloadid0b49xemrterateezekdzylvdedg following 20140924 152855 httpsdrivegooglecomucexportdownloadid0b49xemrterateezekdzylvdedg resolving drivegooglecom 7412523066 7412523069 7412523064 connecting to drivegooglecom7412523066443 connected http request sent awaiting response 200 ok length unspecified texthtml saving to “stdout” 2923 ks in 0s 20140924 152855 283 mbs written to stdout 2923 gzip stdin not in gzip format tar child returned status 1 tar error is not recoverable exiting now and dont worry im not just starting the project im done with it actually but i just really want to get the hang of linux
student,in the lecture we are given a function like following int strlenchar s char p s while p p return p s dont we add a in front of ps like ps since ps is like an address
student,my partner and i write p2cpp independently but work on test together so can my partner and i submit different p2cpp but same testcpp
student,for the test file p2testcpp that we will be turning in should we be writing multiple individual test cases for each function that we wrote or should we instead be writing one test function for every function which we would then pass different cases into
student,will project 3 be released today
student,currently my grouptxt looks like this myuniqname partneruniqname and that is it both names are all lower case and on the same line just seperated by a space and neither are spelled wrong do they have to be uppercase on seperate lines perhaps we have the project done we just want to be able to feel comfortable having a solid submission down for both of us thanks for the help in advance
student,i know this has been answered before but do partners submit just once with two names on it or twice with two names
student,so just to clarify were only required to turn in map right or are we supposed to do both map and fold
student,i keep getting this error when i submit my project to the autograder but all that my grouptxt file includes is one uniquename mine warning there was an error in your grouptxt file you appear to have listed more than 2 uniqnames in grouptxt
student,what functions should we use stress tests for i feel like doing a stress test for every function would be unnecessary and make p2testscpp have a really long run time
student,in the accumulate function where do you put the arguments so the function knows what to addmultiply i get an error when i try to put them in the helper function
student,do we need rmes for our regular functions in p2cpp do we need rmes for our helper functions in p2cpp do we need rmes for our test case functions in p2testscpp
student,i tried to declare a function of type listt but the complier does not recognize listt as a valid type and the program does not compile i have included iostream p2h recursiveh and recursivelisth why am i getting the error p2cpp17 error expected initializer before ‘listt’ line 17 is just the declaration of the reverse function
student,ive tried searching and cant seem to find if were expected to write rmes for the functions that we are supposed to implement ie do we copy and paste the rmes from the p2 pdf into our code or are they not needed because its already known what the rme clauses for that given function will be
student,so for filter id like to write a helper function however when compiling i received the message error fn cannot be used as a function this is what i have under the filter function return filterhelper fn in the helper function id like to be able to work with the original list and obviously as required use fn on all the values of list any help is appreciated thanks
student,i past all the cases i donot know what my final grades will be can somebody explain the final grades of proj2 please keep in mind that the autograder does not assign grades project grades also take style efficiency and other deliverables into account test cases used for grading may be completely different than those used to evaluate trial submissions checking for style errors include p2h include recursiveh include iostream using namespace std ok running test cases running test 7a pass running test 6a pass running test 5a pass running test 4a pass running test 3a pass running test 2a pass running test 1a pass running test 14a pass you passed 8 out of 8 test cases measuring 88 notifying partner renyiyu of submission
student,google docs wont let me download the project 2 files again the message reads sorry you cant view or download this file at this time too many users have viewed or downloaded this file recently please try accessing the file again later if the file you are trying to access is particularly large or is shared with many people it may take up to 24 hours to be able to view or download the file if you still cant access a file after 24 hours contact your domain administrator i tried 24 hours ago and i tried again now
student,when i try to call the fn argument in the recursive line of the helper function it gives me the errors invalid conversion from int to intint int and initializing argument 3 of int accumhelpint listt intint int int can anyone tell me what this means am i not calling it correctly
student,i know we arent allowed to use loops in p2cpp but are we allowed to use loops in p2testscpp
student,i implemented the containedby function in a tail recursive way but i called traversal in the function so is it still considered just recursive
student,is it still considered regular recursive if we use helper functions i always thought that only tail recursive functions are only allowed to have helper functions i am trying to make another helper functions for bool containedby i already made the function coveredby but it seems to me i need to make another helper function to actually make the function containedby work
student,hey can we assume tree a will be smaller than tree b i feel like that should have be included in the requires clause
student,i am unable to access the autograder because i am not in the classlist how can i be added to the classlist
student,bool 1 bool 1 bool 1 bool 1 bool 0 bool 1
student,what if the element a we are trying to insert already exists in the tree then is it to be inserted to the left of a in the tree or to its right do we need to check if the element already exists thanks
student,just switched over from using xcode when i compile my test caseseven when i am just using the given test cases i am receiving no output can someone give me a suggestion
student,so far i have gotten my traversal function to return a list with the correct order of elements in the outermostlargest left subtree includes the topmost element and all the ones to the left of it however i cant figure out how to traverse the right subtree after ive traversed the left side can someone give me a hint as to how you would first traverse the left side then move on to the right subtree
student,can we get rid of the free test case you gave us i would rather have the whole thing be functions rather than have a ton of code inside the main
student,cant think of how to actually insert the element into the original tree once i get to the right place if i made a new tree the rest of the information would be lost from the old tree any help would be great
student,so for inserttree i have figured out how to find the location of where the element belongs but i am stuck on how to place that element there if someone could just explain it theoretically i would appreciate it
student,when writing my p2testscpp file i have finished testing the sum function using the given code but now when i try to do the same for product it says there is no matching function call to product to fix this i tried to include p2cpp but it then says that that file cannot be found
student,have grades for project 1 been posted
student,i keep getting this error when i submit to autograder your submittargz file failed to extract properly make sure that the following command successfully unpacks your archive tar xzvf submittargz you have not been charged a submission make sure that your archive included p2cpp p2testscpp and grouptxt
student,i made a covered by function before starting contained by but i get an error when compiling this if i define it in p2tests then it functions fine but if i define it in p2cpp it shoots out an error my guess is this is due to covered by not being in any of the header functions should i be adding it to any of the given files such as p2h otherwise i dont know how to use it in containedby since that will be in p2cpp
student,im using xcode for this project and i ran into a problem with testing my rotate and insertlist functions when i run the code it doesnt produce any errors but instead of giving me any output it stops where i call the function in main and shows this what does this mean and how do i fix it
student,so i failed all the tests according to the autograder even though im confident most of my code is correct can i get some more information on what exactly the autograder tests are doing so that i know what to work on for example are they trying different test values in my p2testscpp file or directly in my p2cpp file thanks
student,i havent used assert statements in the testing i know it is highly recommended but will i lose points for not using them thanks
student,probably a stupid question but im in 1695 bbb for office hours and i dont see a 280 sign have no idea what to look for
student,we are compiling our project in terminal but our call to make file keeps giving us the output no rule to make target p2testscpp needed by tar stop our makefile has the updated grouptxt we cant figure out why make tar wont run
student,when i submitted my project to the autograder it passed the first seven test cases and then stopped on the last test case is this an indication that there is something wrong with the function it was testing running test cases running test 7a pass running test 6a pass running test 5a pass running test 4a pass running test 3a pass running test 2a pass running test 1a pass running test 14a
student,in the terminal i entered my directory that has all of the projects files on it all the cpps and hs and typed make p2tests like the spec says to do i was met with pages of error saying that there are undefined references to recursivelist i didnt include any cpp files in p2cpp or p2testscpp anyone know whats going on
student,can we copy pasta the tree equal function into our p2cpp and use it for the treecontainedby function
student,for example1 and 1 and etc
student,im getting this window when i try to download the tar and makefile is this normalwill it be resolved soon
student,do we need to write rmes for helper functions
student,the same as the summary in addition in the tests do i need to use print or assert to test whether the two lists or trees are the same
student,for the fibtail function it recommends that we start at 0 and 1 then proceed to work up but is that necessary if i already found a tail recursive way to start at n and work down
student,what would be the base case for this function
student,the command line given doesnt work presumably for the same reason that follows and downloading off of ctools doesnt work either the files say that they have been vieweddownloaded too many times recently will there be a way to get these files again
student,we can get our traversal to work when we define our list outside of the function what does this mean any ideas about how to fix it or can we just keep our list outside of the function
student,should coveredby be static or not
student,i deleted the email with my autograder report for project 1 and my grade is not showing up on the gradebook tab i would really like to know what i got so wherehow can i
student,so far i have my traversal function check if the tree to the left is empty and until it isnt it checks again when it gets to the left most tree it returns that element i am having trouble understanding how to make my function now move back to the right and return each element in the same return statement please help thanks
student,when making helper function for functions like rotate or insert would the declared integer in the helper function argument need to be unsigned int n too or can it just be int n
student,hi my partner and i submitted our project and the autograder scored us an 88 but we havent even written the last tree function could someone please explain why this is the case thanks
student,when i try to compile p2testscpp the complier says listt was not declared in this scope and there is a primayexpression before int the lines that is says theses errors are in are the lines they gave to us and i have not touched them or the code before them
student,if i insert 1 into the following tree 4 2 5 3 does my result have to be the following 4 2 5 1 3 or could it have 3 as the top element as long as its sorted for example 3 1 4 2 5
student,p2cpp in function u2018treet inserthelperint treetu2019 p2cpp632 error control reaches end of nonvoid function p2cpp in function u2018treet inserttreeint treetu2019 p2cpp574 error control reaches end of nonvoid function i get this error message from the compile when i use the wall werror pedantic o2 flags however when i omit those flags i get the correct output for my insert tree function what is causing the error messege
student,in the requires clause it says l has to have at least n elements do we need to account for this in our implementation of the function or is this just meant for the person inputting the data
student,will we be penalized if we dont write functions to use to test the functions in p2h thanks
student,4 2 5 1 3 4 is the bolded 4 a valid insert for a binary tree
student,tmpccm6cyfro in function choptestrecursivelist unsigned int p2testscpptext0x705 undefined reference to choprecursivelist unsigned int collect2 ld returned 1 exit status i tried to make a test case function in my p2testscpp for the chop function i did test case functions for all the functions but for some reason i get this weird error message for my chop test function
student,for the sum product and filter odd and even functions are they considered tail recursive if we utilize the accumulate or filter functions and do not make recursive calls to sum or to product also in general can the helper function be tail recursive while the function from the specs calls that function but is not necessarily tail recursive itself
student,i was checking the midterm and noticed that it was on the 15th of october at the same time as the linear algebra math 217 midterm is there a time for an alternate exam
student,should our test cases in p2testcpp be made static
student,i am trying to run the p2tests and it compiles then when i try and run it just says segmentation fault any advice
student,i am just starting on my tree sum function and for some reason the logic doesnt make sense to me i get how trees work and such but i dont understand how i can account for both sides of the tree as i work down it and add the elements at the top of each that i come to how can i account for the left and right side of the tree individually though
student,what do we do when the n in listinsert is bigger than first in listrotate it keeps going but if nsize first then how would that work what are we supposed to do when n size listinsert
student,will style points be deducted if we use helper functions in situations where the function could have been written without one
student,is it acceptable to use append for some edge cases of insertlist for example when n is 0 i can just use append second first instead of doing the recursive call to complete this would it be acceptable if i add a check if n is 0 or n is the no of elements in first and then just use append with appropriate parameters
student,is there a way to check the number of elements present in a list
student,i made tests including lists with negative numbers the strange thing is my filtereven works with negative numbers but my filterodd does not i even double checked that 1 mod 2 1 on a calculator and it is but for some reason in my code does 1 2 0 doesnt 1 2 1
student,when making a test case for my tree functions i notices that the branches run out of room and are cutoff how do we add an extra dash before another subtree so that all the branches have room to extend will we be marked down if we dont do this
student,do we get email confirmation once we finish the post lab just wanted to make sure that it was recorded thanks
student,i want to use treeequal in p2cpp for the containedby function can i copy the function from p2testscpp and add it to p2cpp under a different name
student,i like to write a few test cases for all my functions in project 2 but i like to be able to actually see my results on the terminal the project spec states that test cases must crash if they do not meet expected output and that at least 1 test case must be written can i continue writing test cases with visual results or do i have to write atleast 1all using assert assert is very good on accumulate and sum but not as much for reverse
student,do we have to submit a txt file with the output that should be generated by p2testcpp if all of the functions are correct
student,do we have to test accumulate and filter i know that we have to test all functions but by testing filterodd and filtereven we test filter and by testing sum and product we test accumulate
student,i just wrote my own list size function in my p2cpp and am trying to test it in my p2testscpp when i try to compile the p2tests its telling me that function name wasnt declared in this scope do i have to declare the function name somewhere
student,hi im trying to understand how to use treemake and was trying to see if someone could help me build the tree on the example page
student,can anyone tell me exactly what this error means i have no idea how to fix this p2testscpptext0x258 undefined reference to sumrecursivelist
student,make p2tests make no rule to make target recursivelistcpp needed by p2tests stop can someone explain this
student,having a hard time with this one i can get it so that i have the second list with the rest of the first list but i cant figure out have to get n numbers from the first list on the front eg list1 1 2 3 4 5 list2 6 7 8 9 n 2 i can get to 6 7 8 9 3 4 5 should i be going about this a different way
student,this is probably very basic for everyone else but even after completing lab 1 im still confused on the steps needed to run code through caenlinux im working through terminal on a mac after logging into the umich system with ssh uniqnameloginenginumichedu im a little lost i know how to make directories and change directories but am not sure in what order i should do everything can someone please outline the steps for me i still need to transfer my local files to caen via sftp its okay if you break down the steps as if im stupid meaning literally step by stepi wont be offended
student,when i stress test my fib function the nontailrecursive one in xcode the program never ends but doesnt give any error i understand why this form of the fib function takes up so much memorytime but this probably shouldnt be happening my code seems correct though any idea whats going on
student,im just posting here to clarify if my understanding of the append function is correct if the two lists were 123 and 8910 would the append function create a new list that is 1238910 thanks just making sure if i am understanding this correctly
student,i would like to write add and multiplication functions so that i can use them to test accumulate function would it be okay to add function declarations in p2h so that i wont have to redefine them on both testp2 and p2cpp files thanks
student,we are trying to test containedby and covered by functions but we got an error what does this error meanhow do u fix it terminate called after throwing an instance of tree exception what error tree empty aborted
student,before i noticed that we had to write a filter function i wrote my own filter function to help with filterodd and filtereven that looks like this im confused how to write filter without having two lists one to hold the original data and one the filtered data can anyone point me in the right direction
student,if we write our own selfdefined functions where or which files do we put the prototypes and implementations of these extra functions
student,do we need to do testing with so much detail for all of the functions ie cout the actual sum and expected sum create variables etc ive just be implementing liststrees i made function by function and then making them into comments so the only thing outputting is the function im working on any advise is wonderful
student,in the specs the rme states requires fn must be associative effects return identity if list is empty return fnlistfirstlist accumulatelistrestlist fn identity otherwise be sure to make above code tail­recursive 1 im not sure what fnlistfirstlist the second return in the effects means in lecture i think it was stated that we would use product and sum functions as inputs to the function pointer in accumulate
student,wouldnt it make more sense to use helper procedures in tree functions because you have to go recursively though the left and right trees two recursive calls instead of going recursively once for lists
student,can anyone give me guidance as to what these test cases 4 5 6 and 7 specifically evaluate
student,are there still office hours in 1695 bbb today
student,how do we determine whether or not an instance of tail recursion requires a helper function i know it often does but there have also been cases where we dont whats the logic in determining its necessity
student,hi i wrote a few of the functions for the lists in p2cpp and wanted to test with the one test case provided i typed make p2test and i receive a bunch of errors like this in function sumhelperrecursivelist int p2cpptext0x99 undefined reference to recursivelistrecursivelist not sure why this error comes up
student,my partner and i ran our program through the autograder we passed half our tests and then lost 4 points to the following we correctly declared our uniquenames with a space in between however our names were not in alphebetical order and were in all capsdid this effect the declaration also is there any guidance you can suggest regarding test cases 4 5 6 and 7 what functions do they pertain to at the very least deducting 4 points for incorrect partner declaration
student,what do we do if n is larger than the size of the list in the rotate function what should we have the code do in that scenario
student,if we make the base case n 0 then it does not count 0s properly if i based it on the length of the number then i would have to use the string library is that even considered to be within the scope of this lab i feel like there must be something else to be considered but i have absolutely no idea i even tried google please help tt
student,if the specified requires is that n the number of elements in first does this mean that in our function we dont need to check that this is true before proceeding also does our function need to end if the entered n doesnt satisfy requirements or do we assume that when grading only valid n values will be used
student,do we have to do any user input checking for example do we have to check that n is the number of elements in the first list for the insertlist function
student,5 3 7 2 2 5 5 9 this is my tree and i know the order should at least start with 5 2 5 3 5 but i dont know how the right side of the trees leftness should be determined would it be 9 2 7

student,i know we cant use global variables in p2cpp but are we allowed to use them in p2testscpp so we dont have to recreate our testing lists over and over
student,for countdigitstest00 should we be returning 1 or 0
student,to reference other functions we wrote in the functions we write ie i reference my reverse function in some of the other functions i wrote such as append and rotate
student,i am doing lab work at home and was wondering which files i was supposed to submit on ctools assignment folder just countdigitscpp and hailstonecpp or should i also include factcpp thanks

student,should we return an empty list if an empty list is passed into these functions
student,or is a legitimate attempt accepted
student,in the rmes on labster its says n 0 is this a typo or are we really including 0
student,i copy and pasted my code for the lab into a text file that opens in the program called notepad on my computer will whoever is grading my lab be able to open that text file if i attach it on ctools
student,what does this error mean i got it when i tried compiling my project p2cpp274 error conversion from ‘treet const treet’ to nonscalar type ‘treet’ requested thanks
student,how many leaves can be on a subtree could it be an infinite amound
student,i am completely lost on how to even go about writing a test can someone explain the basic syntax of how it works
student,i know that casting a negative int to an unsigned int will alter its value but if i have a positive int value and i cast it to an unsigned int will i get a different value or will the casted int retain its original int value
student,im a little bit confused about the hint for inserttree are we to use the traversal function to determine the location for the input
student,i just wrote a function and a helper function both tail recursive to calculate and return the length of a list when i place these two functions inside p2cpp and call the length function in p2testscpp it says that my length function hasnt been declared does this mean that functions that i write myself which are not helper functions to the alreadydeclared sum product reverse etc functions should be written and declared in p2testscpp and not p2cpp
student,i am wondering how we will be graded for our testing part will we have to provide correct answers to our own test cases and check if they match if yes do we exit quit the program once a mismatch is detected
student,ive finished the survey and im on the page with the code submission and the captcha ive tried to submit several dozen times and every time it says sorry your response was incorrect please try again is the problem that i need to fix something in my code or is it telling me that im failing the captchas ive doublechecked the former several times and i cant believe that ive accidentally misread the captcha every single time
student,for some reason im unable to save p2testscpp is there any obvious reason why this is occurring thank you
student,hi i was wondering if there is a way to test if a function is tail recursive i currently have almost all of them done but some of them i am unsure of if they are tail recursive when other within them for example if within functiona i return functionbfunctiona is this still tail recursive if b isnt tail recursive and what if it is
student,what should we return if a list contains one element for example if a list 7 what should the product of the list return sum thanks
student,hi i finished my tail recursion for countdigits both in the caen environment and the the labster and it runs perfectly the only problem is that in the labster even if the function is tailrecursive the memory display on the left still changes like the regular recursion while the iteration reuse the storage of the stack frame then i doubt if i was not writing a correct tail recursion then i tried to put the factorial tail recursion example in the lecture notes into labster and then it also runs like regular recursion without reusing the storage of the stack frame thus i believe that there is some issues with the labster whose memory display shows incorrectly
student,what does this error mean terminate called after throwing an instance of listexception what error empty list i am just trying to get p2testscpp to output something i am just starting the project
student,my code runs and exits at this point does anyone know why it does this or what its trying to tell me because its not clear to me at all
student,im trying to compile my project in xcode but it keeps coming up with this error in the recursivelistcopynodes function the error occurs on the line of code copyto new nodecopyfromelt and it says thread 1 excbadaccess code 2 how can i fix this so i can test my functions thanks
student,i tried to input a 2 to rotate function the project still compile but just print some weird number like 429496793 does that mean i need to do something to convert negative number to positive number or i can assume autograder test rotate function by inputting negative number
student,i am having trouble resetting my variable inside the recursion function to 0 without it resetting every time through my function is below thank you int countdigitsrecursiveint n int digit int count if n 10 return count n digit int curdigit n 10 n n10 if curdigit digit count count 1 countdigitsrecursiven digit return count
student,im using eecs 280 labster for lab 2 for the tail recursive version of the countdigits function i am using a helper function with an extra parameter to count the number of digits however eecs280 labster responds saying that i used countdigitstailhelper without declaring it however when i do declare it it states that countdigitstailhelper cannot be declared more than once in this scope when i put the same code into a c file then compile on my own computer and run it works perfectly
student,do we have to write rmes for test cases can we write test cases that require arguments to be passed to it
student,includeiostream includecmath include recursiveh using namespace std int sumlistt int sumh ok running test cases running test 7a pass running test 6a pass running test 5a pass running test 4a pass running test 3a pass running test 2a fail running test 1a pass running test 14a pass you passed 7 out of 8 test cases measuring 78 is this 78 for all my functions or just sum note the last 2 binary tree functions and the filter pointer function were not included in my p2cpp
student,on the specs for p2 it says fib0 0 and fib1 1 does this mean 0 is the 0th fibonacci number 1 is the first 1 is the second 2 is the third 3 is the fourth and so on or is 0 the first element in the fibonacci and so on i know the sequence is 0 1 1 2 3 and so on but in writing fib when n 3 i dont know whether the third fibonacci number should be 1 or 2
student,what is the identity i am having trouble understanding what it is
student,i think someone may have asked this but do we just put the rmes for any helper functions above their definitions
student,say i have tree a 2 3 5 1 6 3 8 9 7 and i have tree b 3 1 6 is tree b covered by a or does it have to be 3 1 6 9 7
student,i put all of the files in xcode and am getting the following build error can someone help me understand what this means
student,will p2testscpp be graded for style as well
student,if the input tree is an empty tree would the result of inserttree just be a tree with the input integer as the root
student,since a tailrecursive helper function accomplishes the same thing as its nonhelper caller how is its rme supposed to differ from that of the nonhelper function also if certain inputs are needed for the helper function to work properly such as the 1 in the factorial helper function call facthelpernum 1 from the lecture slides should that be mentioned as a requirement
student,my accumulate function works but when testing it i realized that the base case returns identity if identity is 0 the function will work if the function pointer is pointing to add because eventually it will add 0 and end however when testing the accumulate function with the pointer pointing to multiply the answer is always 0 because the base case will eventually multiply by 0 if i change identity to 1 the multiply case works but when the pointer points to the add function the output will be the correct answer plus 1 not sure how to find a way around this without specifying in my accumulate function whether add or multiply is being passed through
student,if we used the accumulate function in our sum and product function would it be sufficient to say that any test cases to the sum and product functions would also be testing the accumulate function for me the two obvious tests to accumulate in main would just basically be rewriting the sum and product functions i wasnt sure if writing an explicit test case for accumulate would be necessary
student,i successfully implemented my filterodd and filtereven functions and am trying to do filter i am using a helper function for this and one of the parametersarguments passed to the helper fxn is the function fn when i try to call the helper function by doing helperfunctionparameter1 parameter2 fnint value where int value is replaced by an updated value ive made sure that the value passed to fn is actually a valid int but i still get an error message saying there is no matching function for call to helper function am i missing something important on how to pass the bool function to the helper function i believe it is that parameter thats causing an issue here
student,would the code below from the postlab survey even compile the func function requires to integer inputs as parameters so the bold part below would make things act a little funky right int funcint x int y if x 0 return y else if x 0 return funcx funcy 1 else return funcx1 y1
student,when one of the lists but not both is empty are we supposed to just return the list that isnt empty or are we supposed to return a list that has an empty space if so how can i make a list that has an empty space
student,why is thursday 1 pm discussion at ross building it is extremely inconvenient since most of our classes are on north
student,is rotate allowed to use a number larger than the list
student,the given example does not make sense as i am reading it 4 2 5 3 the function is supposed to add elt to a leaf st the new tree is still sorted however the example solution places 1 as the left subtree of the 23 tree 2 is by definition not a leaf since it has 3 as a subtree and 3 is not empty is this the correct interpretation
student,i got feedback saying that all of the test cases failed to compile i havent finished the project yet but is this a product of all of the functions testing being buggy or is there another reason why none of them are compiling thanks
student,when you append two empty lists should you be getting or where is an empty space in other words does appending two empty lists just give you a single empty list or do you get two empty lists added together two blank spaces instead of one
student,thank you
student,how would i assert lists like i used assert in tests for sum and product if i just check assertlista listb i get an error and my program ends is there another way that im supposed to use assert for lists
student,if you call the listrestlist on a single element list does it return a empty list
student,p2cpp in function u2018int accumulatelistt int listt intu2019 p2cpp95 error control reaches end of nonvoid function p2testscpp in function u2018int mainu2019 p2testscpp83 error a functiondefinition is not allowed here before u2018u2019 token p2testscpp163 error expected u2018u2019 at end of input i tried to compile the accumulate function and i got a bunch of errors that dont make sense
student,hello i am working on redeveloping my test cases in light of todays lecture and the assert function seemed very promising however to properly use it for list functions i would have to create new lists from scratch using only the listmake functions given how i have a few stress tests this would probably be a tedious and inefficient process is there another way to do something similar and still get full credit
student,if you call a nontail recursive function functiona inside of a another function functionb and there are no calculations after that call in functionb does that make it tail recursive
student,i got the following error message when i ran the command make tar makefile1 warning nul character seen rest of line ignored makefile1 missing separator stop
student,can we call functions that we finished in other functions were supposed to make
student,where can i find the prelab and postlab surveys
student,im having trouble figuring out how to go about writing this function how should i be thinking about this any hints thanks
student,hello i got my feedback from the autograder saying i got a 68 it says test case 3a and 14a failed to compile is there anyway for me to know what 3a and 14a stands for like which functions it is referring to
student,i tried making the tar using the command make tar as specified but the autograder doesnt seem to take it i also tried unpacking the tar using the command tar xzvf submittargz and this did work whats going wrong and how do i fix it
student,if we call rotatelistmake n where n 0 does this function call return an empty list im just making sure because just from the specification i dont understand if thats a situation we should check for thanks
student,how do u call the function pointer in your code you can just write sum or product because it has to work for either
student,will doubles be put as values in a list
student,is it necessary to use function pointers to shorten functions in project2 if i already wrote my functions for sum and product and so on and they are tail recursive and pass my tests do i need to rewrite them using function pointers or is it ok if i just use function pointers in the accumulate and the filter functions where they already exist as inputs
student,when we submit the files for lab 2 is there a way to do it directly through labster if not am i supposed to create an xcode file and put in my source code there or can i just submit my code in txt file
student,first what is the exact definition of procedural abstraction second when we should use a help function in order to achieve tail recursionwhen can we achieve tail recursion without help function
student,hi i am trying to create the first function is there a way to remove the first number in the list
student,i am completely confused by listt filter function can i get an example of what it would do if i have a list 4 1 3 0
student,in the spec sheet it says as an example that if we are given the list 4 1 3 0 then the expected output should be 4 0 so are we to include 0 in the expected output since technically we dont know what zero is
student,i just started working on project 2 and when i type in int sumlistt list into xcode i keep on getting the error unknown type name listt does anyone know why
student,is there somewhere we can view our grades ie our grade for project 1 after the additional test cases not produced by the autograder were added to it thank you
student,two quick questions 1 for test functions do we need to write rmes for them such as listsumtest instead of putting all our tests in main 2 do we need to declare functions static for test functions as well so its static void listsumtest thanks
student,i think ive got the recursive function for sum how would i test just that function can i just run the make p2tests command to test for my recursive sum function or does the make command only test the entire project meaning i would need to have all the other functions complete to run it thanks for the help
student,i cant seem to get the recursive version of countdigits to work with both 00 and x0 where x is any positive int other than 0 because i cant get 00 to return one without also being off by one on x0 any guidance would be appreciated thanks
student,for project 2 i just defined my static helper functions above the function in which they are used this allows the project to work fine i was wondering whether it is necessary for us to separately declare these static helper functions as well and not just define them thanks
student,say we have a list of 4 elements 1 2 3 4 and we are asked to rotate it 5 elements is that an acceptable test case so that it would be like rotating it 1 once and yield 2 3 4 1
student,when i try testing my treesum function my program ends execution with the thread 1 signal sigabrt it only does it in some cases depending on what the tree i test is like
student,will our test cases be put through the auto grader as well or is it just p2cpp that will be if the test cases print things to cout it might cause a problem
student,im a bit confused as to how the chop function chops for example if i call it like chop1 2 3 4 5 2 will i get back 1 2 3 or 3 4 5 thanks im pretty sure its the first but not entirely
student,is it alright to write helper functions for the functions involving trees i know that these functions do not need to be tail recursive but i still believe helper functions will assist the implementation thanks
student,in the project specs one of the arguments passed to the chop function is entitled 1 when trying to compile im receiving an error that we believe has to do with the name but were not completely sure is there any reason that this should pose a problem
student,what is the best way to test filter do we need to write our own bool functions for the function pointer argument if so do we put them in p2testscpp
student,im using xcode to write project 2 and i created all the files and copied the given code into it and it is producing 2 errors i looked in main in p2tests and there is no sumrecursivelist can anyone shed some light on this
student,are we allowed to write more than one helper function for each given function will the presence of more than one be counted against us during grading
student,i just downloaded all of the files we need for the project and went to compile my program using make p2tests i commented out a couple of lines that contained unused functions in p2testscpp so that i wouldnt get a compile error i am still getting a different error however bash41 make p2tests g wall werror pedantic o2 p2cpp recursivelistcpp binarytreecpp recursivecpp p2testscpp o p2tests tmpccl3739qo in function main p2testscpptext0x330 multiple definition of main tmpccxrwoesop2cpptext0x0 first defined here collect2 ld returned 1 exit status make p2tests error 1 bash41 in my p2cpp file i have only include iostream includecstdlib include p2h using namespace std int main return0 what is the source of this compile error thanks
student,should the function work when you try to append an empty list to a nonempty list and vice versa thanks
student,do we need to have the exact same copy of code as our partner or can ours have differ slightly from theirs
student,i know this is a dumb question but my p2cpp file compiles fine and theres already a test case for the first function but when i write p2 or p2cpp it always says access denied i just want to test my first function so im not sure whats going wrong
student,quick question about using labster for lab 2 when working on the countdigits tail recursive function the lab says to feel free to add a helper function to keep track of the result when i add the helper function labster throws the error countdigitstailhelper was not declared in this scope if i place static in front of the function as with helper functions in project 2 i get a big long syntax error and in either way the code will not compile what can i do to make labster happy with adding a helper function thanks
student,is it true that for any sorted binary tree and for any integer it is possible to find a place to insert that integer in the sorted binary tree my intuition tells me yes but i wanted to clarify one example is this given the wellsorted binary tree 4 2 6 1 3 5 7 if i gave inserttree an integer argument of 4 would the correct insertion be 4 2 6 1 3 5 7 4 i ask because in the spec it says the right subtree is a sorted binary tree and all elements in the right subtree are greater than or equal to the top element of the tree in this case the right subtree has top element 6 but inserting 4 would mean its less than 6 or did you guys mean the right subtree is a sorted binary tree and all elements in its right subtree are greater than or equal to the top element of the tree
student,i dont really get how to make this function tail recursive at all the only way to iterate over a list is to use listrest and get the first value but once youve called listrest on a list you remove an element youll need later to put inside of the new reversed list so im a little confused ive thought about using a helper im not sure what to make it do since i cant really store numbers with it because for every step into the recursion you lose information that was stored in the previous call of the recursive function confused
student,in one of the functions being implemented im calling a separate tailrecursive function in the return statement once it reaches the base case basically i pass two changing lists tailrecursively and when the base case comes up the function returns appendfirst second to get the correct output it never has to recoil the stack frames once it finishes appending the two lists so would that still make the function tailrecursive or would i have to adjust it
student,do you just create a new list and assign the append of two other functions to that new list
student,i just start my project im wondering that what is node how should i use it do i need to understand it by the way should i change anything in binarytreecpp recursivecpp recursivelistcpp
student,i didnt realize there was actually codewriting on the lab surveys just wondering how they were scored thanks
student,i dont remember if the helper functions or just the functions are supposed to be tail recursive is the function just supposed to call the helper function and the helper function is tail recursive or is it the other way around thanks
student,if i understand it correctly were in charge of making the add and mult fcn for accumulate fcns multi functionality however while accumulate should be tail recursive can fcns add and mult simply be two integers being addedmultiplied together or do they have to be tail recursive as well more specifically are they supposed to be the helper functions to accumulate
student,im working on accumulate i wrote an add function and tried calling accumulate in the test file as accumulatelista add 0 but am getting the error that add is undefined even though i defined the function add in p2cpp before the accumulate function thoughts
student,we can use iteration in test cases correct
student,does n have the same meaning as n 0
student,when i type make p2tests into the terminal it takes a second or two to complete is that alright or should it be nearly instantaneous i ask because everything that i did in engr 101 was pretty instantaneous and project 1 in this class was too i want to make sure im not doing something wrong
student,i was checking the course calendar and saw that there is another staff meeting this friday from 1011 is it true that there will be no discussion during that time i am scheduled to attend the 1011 discussion in denn and would need to know ahead of time if i need to be attending a different one
student,is there a requirement for a minimum number of tests that we need to perform on a certain function
student,where are we supposed to declare our helper functions in p2cpp
student,is the list like an array suppose i have a list named a consisting of 3 4 2 1 would list0 list1 3 4 7
student,is it acceptable to use the c ternary operator it was not taught in engr 101 however ive come across it in the past and found it pretty useful that being said if it isnt considered stylistically proper id rather not use it for example if i had the following code if test true return 1 else return 0 could i simplify it using the ternary operator as follows return test 1 0 thanks
student,hello i am getting a bunch of errors when i call this function what is the correct way to call this function assume i have a list named lista…would i just do listprintlista or would i have to declare lista as a const before calling listprint thanks
student,could someone elaborate on the accumulate function im confused by its inputs what is fn and how does it relate to identity
student,in the definition for the rotate function for lists no requires are added does that mean we should make it work for all kinds of input for example should we assume that a user can input 2 to the unsigned int passed to the function
student,i dont see the option to submit project 2 to the auto grader when will be have the ability to
student,i would like to use the chop function in my insertlist function but since chop is implemented after insertlist it is causing problems is it okay to move chop and its associated helper function after insertlist in the source code or will this cause problems thanks
student,i dont understand the accumulate functions parameter identity what is suppose to go in there i see a 0 in the rme but im not sure what that means is it suppose to be the starter of the fn that we use like in addition we start at 0 and in multiplication we would use 1 i read here that the identity number is a number that when used as an argument to a specific function that takes two arguments a binary function causes that function to return the other argument but i still dont get it any more clarification sorry
student,how are we supposed to check each individual function that we write for this project typing this into the terminal gives me errors for other functions that i havent written yet in my p2cpp g wall werror o1 pedantic g recursivecpp recursivelistcpp p2cpp o p2
student,im a bit confused as to what the test listequal does exactly and how we can use it to test our reverse function thanks
student,is there a way to determine the size of a list or are we allowed to use the list library
student,p2cpp24 error ‘listt rotatehelperfuncint’ declared ‘static’ but never defined p2cpp326 error ‘listt chophelperfuncint listt int’ defined but not used can someone help me understand these errors i get them for almost all of my helper functions
student,please and thank you
student,do we need to write rmes for any helper functions we might create in the the making of the functions
student,p2testscpp comes with a free test case may we model a function for testing sum after this test case and copy some of the code of the test case into the function
student,the compiler is telling me that listt which is supposed to be a variable type is not declared and the functions given to us such as listfirst are not declared all these errors are from my p2cpp are we supposed to put include with stuff at the top or something so p2cpp can properly use these things
student,what will listrest function return if the list parameter it takes has only one element will it just return an empty list or it will repeatedly return the only element in that list do we need to worry about that
student,in regards to writing our own functions for test cases should we be including their prototypes and rmes in the p2h file rather than p2cpp
student,i know it says no global or static variables but does that mean we can have variables within the functions just as long as they dont go throughout the whole program
student,can you use listmakevariable list name without first making an empty list for example if i write listt newlist listmakefirst newlist will this make a list containing just the value contained in the variable first or is it necessary that i make a new empty list first also are we allowed to use one of the functions we write in another on of the functions ex can i use my reverse function in my append function
student,how do we make tree test cases for our tree functions
student,for the list functions like sum and product when it says return something if the list is empty should we be using cout or return im pretty sure the answer is return but just making sure
student,for calling the functions defined for type listt ie listisempty do we call them like listisemptylist or listlistisempty
student,my partner just dropped the class is anyone else looking for a partner to work with for project 2
student,can we define our own helper functions for this project or are we only allowed to use the ones that have been defined already
student,i could not find a precise definition of empty tree in the project2 pdf is it a a tree with no top element b a tree with no left subtree and no right subtree a would mean a tree with 5 as the top element but no left or right subtree would not be an empty tree b would mean a tree with 5 as the top element but no left or right subtree would be an empty tree
student,n fibtailn 45 1134903170 46 1836311903 47 1323752223 48 512559680 49 811192543 50 298632863 according to my tail recursive function something is going wrong at n47 is it the lack of memory of the computer or possibly my function will we be responsible for extremely large values of n such as n100
student,the function reverse in project 2 is a tail recursive function if i write a function to reverse a twice namely listt reversetwicelistt a listt b reverse a listt c reverse b return c is this still tail recursive thank you
student,when i tried to compile my file the terminal showed the following error p2cpp in function ‘listt filterhelperlistt bool int listt’ p2cpp153 error a functiondefinition is not allowed here before ‘’ token p2cpp157 error expected ‘’ at end of input what is wrong here
student,p2cpp in function ‘int fibhelperint’ p2cpp326 error control reaches end of nonvoid function p2cpp in function ‘int fibint’ p2cpp305 error control reaches end of nonvoid function p2testscpp in function ‘int main’ i am getting errors that dont make sense even if i put n0 in i still get the aforementioned error messages
student,i understand that making the variable unsigned means n is positive but do we need to worry about the wraparound if the user enters a negative number
student,how is our code supposed to get the lists before executing the function i understand that the sum function should sum the items in the list but where does the list come from are we supposed to write code for cin to get the list from user input i didnt see anything in the project spec about how to actually get the list data also what does an appropriate function call look like is an appropriate function call sum1 2 3
student,for some reason when i run the program it stops execution when it gets to testing the reverse function and i get the following message in the recursivelistcpp file thread 1 excbadaccess code 1 address0x35fbff688
student,how should the rotate function handle a negative number being put in for n i know that the int typecasts into an unsigned int which is usually going to be a huge number but im not sure how to handle that
student,i forgot to put my name at the top of my lab01cpp file is this fine since you guys can see the file was submitted under my uniqnamei didnt work with a partner
student,what should happen if the inputs to the rotate function are something like rotate 123 5 should our code give an error message of some sort or just reverse the entire list
student,can the lists have elements which are negative numbers
student,in the implementation of the reverse function are we modifying and returning the original list it seems that we cannot start anew with an empty list since declaring a new listt in the function call would cause problems during recursive calls thanks
student,the example test case notes that i am allowed to use it as a guide for writing future test cases but am i required to follow it ive found that the given structure can be quite cumbersome for testing multiple cases of a single function i know that were only required to test one case in this project but i prefer to test more to make sure my code is correct if i use a different formatting style that still has assert calls for each of its cases is that okay
student,when i tried to compile my testcpp file using make p2tests the compiler returned with such errors p2cpp in function u2018int sumlisttu2019 p2cpp12 error u2018sumhelperu2019 was not declared in this scope p2cpp in function u2018int productlisttu2019 p2cpp28 error u2018producthelperu2019 was not declared in this scope p2cpp in function u2018int accumulatelistt int int int intu2019 p2cpp40 error u2018accumulatehelperu2019 was not declared in this scope make p2tests error 1 i had used static as suggested and declared the helper functions like the examples at the end of the spec why it is wrong

student,when i try to compile project 2 in a linux environment i get the following error i tried to run the program given on visual studio and i get this error i have no clue whats going on im using the files as is i havent modified them at all
student,in the rem for the rotate function there is no limitation to the value that n may be assigned that being said the spec does not specify how the rotate function should deal with values of n that are greater than the number of elements in the list for example say we input rotate1 2 3 4 5 would the returned list be 2 3 4 1 which is equal to rotate1 2 3 4 1 this seems like it would not fit the specification regarding moving the first n elements as there are not 5 elements to move thanks
student,i accidentally submitted my lab01cpp files without comments at the top unfortunately it doesnt seem to be possible to submit a newer version is this correct or am i missing something
student,i began working on the project and managed to write what i hope is a correct implementation of the sum function however when i went to test it with the single test case given it threw an error i wanted to see what was going on so i put a cout result result is an int keeping track of the sum as well as a call to listprint in the helper function to see exactly what was going on when i called sum however when i call sum from main nothing prints i made sure to put sumhelper above sum included everything etc i put a simple cout hello in both sum and its helper function so two hellos should print but only one does it turns out that its the one in sum thats printing what is going on additionally i have another small question if i made a call to a nonrecursive function as an argument for a recursive function example in sumhelper i call listrest for the listt parameter does it count as tailrecursion
student,can i call an implemented function in another implemented function could i call for example reverse inside of append
student,if for the last step of a function call of one of the functions we were supposed to implement i recusively call the function but do so inside another function such as return makelistele recrusecalllist am i correct in assumming this does not count as tail end recurison
student,i didnt see it in the spec but i thought i had read it somewhere can we have partners for project 2
student,are we supposed to used helper functions for most of the functions
student,can anyone explain to me clearly what the accumulate function is supposed to do better than the rme
student,can we use other functions such as the sum function
student,i know how to write it with recursion but i dont know how to write it with tailrecursion can i get some hints for this function
student,when i click view button it displays this project does not exist or you are not allowed to view it
student,theres so many files where do we begin writing code
student,where do i go to submit lab 1 i thought i was supposed to go to the same place as project 1 but when i do it does not give me the option to choose a projectany help would be appreciated thanks in advance
student,is anyone still looking for a partner for project 2
student,im having trouble understanding how the listh type works when writing recursive functions like product or sum im unsure if the list type works like an array ie listi or if there is another way of accessing its elements
student,for functions like reverse is it sufficient for the test case to print out the original list and then print out the reverse list and then we can expect the user to be able to check if it did it properly example original lista 4 3 2 1 0 reverse lista 0 1 2 3 4 i could see how it would be possible to write functions to automatically check this but it would require a fair amount of extra code to write one for all the functions additionally can we expect any input as to what the standards will be for grading test cases
student,1 about the accumulate function in the spec it use add as an example so do we need to actually implement whatever associative fn we want to test in the p2testscpp i didnt see related function declared anyplace in the files provided so i have to write one to test the function then i have to modify the format of p2testscpp i add the function implementation in p2testscpp is that ok 2 i use a lot of helper function in solving the tailrecursion thing but in the spec it says it is not a necessity so i am wondering for every problem in project2 is there always a solution not using helper function or it is the reverse only small part of the functions can be finished without using a helper function thanks
student,i want to rewatch the lecture on september 10th when can i expect the recording to be uploaded
student,we only have to submit the cpp file that we altered to receive credit for our lab correct thanks
student,hey guys i took the survey and submitted it but when i follow the link to the survey it doesnt remember that i took it i dont want to complete the survey again but i do want to make sure that i get the extra points is there any way for us to confirm that we have submitted it properly thanks
student,i want to know if there is a way to directly upload files to ctool by terminal because i use ssh to log into caens linux and its inconvenient to download lab file to my own computer and upload it
student,in p2testscpp the instructions specify that test cases should be placed in their own functions is it sufficient to write one abstract test case function for each implemented function and then call said test function multiple times for example would it be alright to create a function called testsum which is implemented multiple times in main to test that the sum function is working correctly there would then be another similar function for product accumulate etc or would it be better that each specific test case be placed in their own function ie testsumempty would test for an empty list and testsumlong would test a long list thanks
student,according to sheet effects returns the sum of each element in list zero if the list is empty was this meant to say nonempty if not what is list zero supposed to be defined as
student,requires fn must be associative does this mean fn a function i presume mean it must have addition and multiplication or something because those functionalities are associative and then the identity for addition is 0 and the identity for multiplication is 1 is this enveloped in the function accumulate or do we have to check that the indentity matches for the type of fn
student,we are told in the project specification that we can call our own list functions when implementing other list functions but are we also allowed to call our own list functions when implementing the binary tree functions in the third part of the project
student,im having trouble understanding the intended path for an inorder traversal as mentioned in the project specification for the traversal function for example suppose i have the tree below in which two elements both appear to be leftmost but one is higher up on the tree than the other 4 2 8 9 which is considered more to the left the 2 or the 9 on a related note suppose a path starts out to the right of an element but then has several left branches that lead it to the left of that element as shown below 4 5 3 6 7 in this case which is the leftmost element the 4 or the 7
student,i was wondering but for the test case that is already written lista was created for us however when i print the list it shows up as 4 3 2 1 0 rather than 0 1 2 3 4 is this how its supposed to be or is something wrong with my code
student,hello i dont mean to be rude but i was just seeing if anyone had any real ideas on how to improve the labs particularly in discussions held in places like the dental building where the internet is terrible and there are no provided computers the problem particularly is that the lab seems to focus on using caen redhat linux which is reasonable in itself however that requires us to bring our own laptops and use the vnc applications which relies on the internet mwireless frankly didnt work in the dental building although many of us could work with the vnc over mguest however there many of us could not and i heard from a few people that it was slow and i know someones vnc client disconnectedcrashed which means restarting the client and reopening everything i apologize if this note is cumbersome but can anyone suggest any ideal solutions i saw the tables had ethernet ports next to the power outlets but the tables werent really connected to anything there is the possibility of asking a department to refit the entire room with ethernet cables but thats say 42 cables throughout the room personally however i had little trouble i dualbooted ubuntu linux downloaded everything then disconnected from the internet dualbooting has its own benefits ranging from customizability to not relying on caen unless software is necessary however it also comes with its own disadvantages when put to a largescale having to ask students to randomly install some random os and then make sure they have all the right packages installed fortunately many are at least included in the normal ubuntu installation to put it simply problem we are expected to use caen linux internet is quite solutions wait until more and more people stop coming or switch to discussions with better conditions refit the rooms with ethernet cables ask some students to dualboot with a linux distribution this will probably be quite redundant if the next labs actually dont expect linux but im curious will we be focusing on using linux and if so how can we solve that also i guess this isnt that serious of an issue as many of us will probably just use visual studios or such and then later test it on caen however would that really help us students in the end thanks for considering this even if im over thinking this far far far too much
student,what comments are required at the top of the lab01cpp file the requirements section just says to include your names in the comments at the top of the file is there any specific format to follow at the moment ive just written that the lab01cpp file is edited by with umid
student,do we need to include rmes for functions we implement in our main project file that were declared with rmes in a separate header
student,i was wondering when and where we should expect to see both the autograder and style portion of our project 1 grade
student,is it possible to download the project 2 files using an input on the command line similar to lab01
student,im really enjoyed professor deorios lectures on recursion and found the references to the stack and heap intriguing im interested in learning more about how exactly programs interact with a computers hardware are there any good resources that would be recommended for further reading on such subjects
student,the caen vnc cilent works for my win 7 system but when i switch to my win 81 system it will display the following message i have tried several methods like changing the directory file name disk name but nothing works is it because 81 is lack of functions compared win7
student,so the first time i submitted to the autograder the only feedback i got were topics already covered ie source code size iocpp style and line characterlength the weird thing is i dont see anything about passedfailed test cases should i assume no news is good news also the line numbers given in the autograder report were incorrect should i disregard this
student,just curious on when project 2 will be released
student,i saw a post on this before however in that the student had to rename the file that had the and then it worked for them i have a file without the yet it still doesnt work…what am i doing wrong when i did ls i see that the lab01cpp file does exist yet i am still getting these errors bash41 ls lab01 lab01cpp lab01cpp lab01out lab01outcorrect bash41 g ­wall ­werror ­o1 ­pedantic ­g lab01cpp ­o lab01 g ­wall no such file or directory g ­werror no such file or directory g ­o1 no such file or directory g ­pedantic no such file or directory g ­g no such file or directory g ­o no such file or directory bash41
student,i chose to use a cmathmathh function which rounds down positive numbers to the nearest smaller integer but rounds up the negative numbers so 23 becomes 20 as in literally the 3 gets dropped so i didnt use the more popular floor function it is indicated that such is a popular option on here while i test my programs myself typing in years with decimals that do not end in 0 works just fine but my program doesnt pass the autograder is there any insight that can be provided on this thank you and the feedback look like this test case fracyears failed runtime sec 0002 memory usage kb 1276 line 4 correct output 12 student output 18
student,i am getting an error message for this step which reads now let’s automatically test the output stored in lab01out weve provided a file called lab01outcorrectcontaining the correct output when a population of 250000is used copy it to your folder using cp afsumicheduclasseecs280lablab01lab01outcorrect this is the error message i got although i typed up exactly what it said to in the directions cp missing destination file operand after afsumicheduclasseecs280lablab01lab01outcorrect try cp help for more information how can i fix this thanks
student,on the quick reference caen linux it says this means youll need to do your final testing and submit from a caen machine to ensure we are able to run your code properly …what do they mean by we must submit from a caen machine i submitted from my laptop and i passed the auto graders test cases so should i be fine in this regard thanks
student,does it matter if we use long float or double they all pretty much accomplish the same thing

student,so i already submitted two times with the autograder today the first time i got fracyears and long test cases failed so i went back and look some more change a few things that i think needed to be fixed and submitted it again but i still failed some tests now i cant submit no more in case my submission isnt the right answer so im wondering what the heck should i do now when i tested the test1 file using diff no error showed up also when i input 45 23 etc for years my terminal correctly prompts me for reinput hence my question about what fracyears looks for so far i know that if i input actual fractions as years the program fails as in if i input 33 that program doesnt take that as 1 but from what i read up here im supposed to not worry about that case but i have no idea why i failed the test if my code was able to show no error with inputs such as 45 or 23 please help thanks
student,i am wondering how to differ one variable type from another thanks so much
student,i passed the other 5 but i am not sure what the long test case is doing and i am not sure why it is giving me this weird mismatch thanks
student,i finished the lab in class but i couldnt figure out how i can actually download a copy of the finished version of lab01cpp im using ssh by the way
student,i know a lot of people have posted similar questions but i havent been able to figure out what im doing wrong from reading other posts
student,my program continues to run if my input for years is 19999999999999999999 when there are only 5 9s it reprompts the user how precise does this checking have to be how can i solve this problem if it is a problem
student,i was wondering what the method might be for finding another person to work with on the remaining projects i recall in class you mentioned there was somewhere online to look but i do not remember if it was on piazza or another place i dont necessarily want to start spamming piazza with partner requests thanks
student,whenever i compile my code then try and run it i am told that permission denied does anyone have any clue how to fix this thanks in advance
student,when i submitted my project to the autograder i received the following feedback test case rate failed runtime sec 38882 memory usage kb 1264 the program was stopped with signal sigxcpu your program exceeded the time limit i assume this means that my program hit an infinite loop but ive run my program repeatedly with different test cases and none of them have hit an infinite loop can someone tell me what the error message means
student,regarding procedural abstractionrmes if we impose restrictions in the requires clause we still have to account for this in our code ie if we require the caller to supply arguments 0 then wed also have to have a few lines that alert you about it or errors correct
student,hi id just like a formal confirmation since i dont recall seeing this written anywhere we are allowed to attend any section of lecture we are allowed to attend any section of lab or not attend lab as long as we turn in the lab assignment by 1155 pm on friday thank you
student,from iocpp line 12 cin result that line of code should pause and wait for user input regardless of any other circumstances no like the code shouldnt be going off in an endless loop if it gets to that line it should stop and wait for the user to press enter before continuing to the next line right or is there something in my p1cpp file that would cause this line to be skipped in iocpp the issue im having is that when i enter a number as a fraction getparam runs it displays the prompt then continues to display the same prompt until i ctrlc out i slapped in two other cout test statements above and below the line of code displayed above in iocpp and it prints both of those out fine also in an infinite loop when testing fractions is there some reason in my iocpp or the way im compiling im using all the proper flags laid out in the spec decimals min and max all work as intended oh and this might also just be a linux thing but if i enter 732 it treats the input as 7 but if i enter 732 it starts having this issue is that just how linux works or should i be concerned about it not reading the 32 if i dont have parentheses
student,i am in basement ugli right now and i cant find any gsiia hosting office hours for eecs 280 on the calendar it shows there is office hours from 1230230 pm today can somebody please help me on this
student,is there anything else we needed to do to earn a good grade on the project besides have our code work as indicated by the auto grader and follow the styling sheet
student,significantly larger than the avg for all students as described by the auto grader

student,program author uniqe name partner gsi description in eecs 183 we were required to have the above lines in our codes for some reasons are we required or advised to do the same in this class
student,so i was in 183 and havent used caen besides what we did in discussion so im very unfamiliar with all of this i have my p1cpp on my caen desktop and im trying to run it in the terminal but it keeps telling me that the file isnt in the directory how do i fix this i did the cd command of my p1 folder where p1cpp is but that didnt work what am i doing wrong once its in my directory how do i start compiling with g ive been sifting through the 3 or so pdfs on c tools about this but cant seem to find the correct answer
student,for the compiling in g i run into a syntax error whenever i try to compile even though i copy the prompt exactly as it says in the 280 webpage specifically it shows this octave2 g wall werror o1 pedantic g p1cpp iocpp o io parse error syntax error g wall werror o1 pedantic g p1cpp iocpp o io the error directs to the 1 in p1cpp if someone could help me i would greatly appreciate it
student,is there a way to check how many characters are in a line for style
student,hi i made sure my ioh and iocpp and p1cpp were all in the same directory included ioh in my p1cpp but i get these errors when i try to compile tmpcc1zhbaho in function main afsumicheduusermemekwondocumentsprojectsp1cpp6 undefined reference to getparamstdbasicstringchar stdchartraitschar stdallocatorchar double double afsumicheduusermemekwondocumentsprojectsp1cpp7 undefined reference to getparamstdbasicstringchar stdchartraitschar stdallocatorchar double double afsumicheduusermemekwondocumentsprojectsp1cpp8 undefined reference to getparamstdbasicstringchar stdchartraitschar stdallocatorchar double double afsumicheduusermemekwondocumentsprojectsp1cpp11 undefined reference to getparamstdbasicstringchar stdchartraitschar stdallocatorchar double double afsumicheduusermemekwondocumentsprojectsp1cpp14 undefined reference to printheader afsumicheduusermemekwondocumentsprojectsp1cpp31 undefined reference to printmonthlydataint double double double collect2 ld returned 1 exit status at least i think the error is that the functions arent being recognized or am i misinterpreting the error
student,are we allowed to submit the lab more than once if we found mistakes that were made i know all submissions have to be made before the deadline but is it okay to do more than once thanks
student,sorry if this has been asked before im confused about how extensive our test cases need to be i passed all of the autograder tests should i just error check each of the inputed parameters and make sure my program responds appropriately
student,for some reason after i run getparam all three times the program just terminates it doesnt complete the rest of the lines i even tried testing with having it print a number after and it doesnt recognize it
student,does the years input need to account for integers with lets say 20 zeroes after the decimal places
student,when writing comments would it be better to separate pieces of my program with spaces for readability purposes just grouping them with comments does it matter for example the following functions does function things void func below the loop checks the value of i for int i 0 i 5 i vs the following functions does function things void func below the loop checks the value of i for int i 0 i 5 i
student,when i submitted my project to the autograder it passed all test cases but under the style suggestions it mentioned inconsisten brace style in iocpp and ascii program text ok in ioh do we need to go into those files and adjust that or just leave it also will lines that the autograder says are too long be counted against us
student,i was wondering what kind of input the first test case gives i keep failing this single test case does it simply encompass integer years such as 2 or 20000 thank you
student,is piazza an appropriate place to do this i dont know anyone within the class so an online tool would help me do it
student,i was wondering will i lose points if i do not follow this feedback from the autograder p1cpp ascii c program text consider replacing defines with a const variable or typedefline 4 doing so will preserve type information for the identifier
student,is the last submission into the autograder the one that is graded officially or is there another location where we need to submit our cpp files
student,do we have to write rems for functions we create
student,im working in one of the caen computer labs and when i logged in it went to a windows desktop the quick references page on ctools just says to reboot to linux how do i go about doing this
student,whenever i try to compile my code i get the error g –o1 no such file or directory i am using a caen computer and typing in the command line exactly as it appears in the project description g pedantic wall werror –o1 p1cpp iocpp o p1
student,ive read all the posts about this but none seem to help me i was wondering do numbers that end in a 0 ie 10 50 etc count as valid
student,just submitted to the autograder and i have a couple questions about the feedback 1 at the top of the feedback email the autograder lists found x tokens in source im assuming x is the number of characters the autograder then warns that if x exceeds the student average by a significant amount to consider cutting down your source code where can we see the student average 2 for each of the test cases there is a memory usage kb and a memory budget kb if im reading those numbers right my memory usage is way over the memory budget is this something we need to be concerned with thanks
student,i cant find a similar thread on piazza i submitted twice yesterday but both times autograder said i had submitted 03 times
student,do we get extra credit for submitting early like in 183

student,a user could enter a monthly payment amount with more than two decimals for example they could say the monthly payment is 10023532 this is not a valid dollar amount because it has more than two decimals however the code would still handle it like it is a valid amount since the input is a double do we have to round user input so it is appropriate or is the difference so small that we can ignore this and not have to consider it in our code thanks

student,i was trying to figure out how to use the mac terminal to run gedit i downloaded xquartz but when i try to ask the terminal to run gedit it brings up an error any ideas of why this is
student,neither my computer nor the caen computers in the fishbowl recognize them because of this i cant test my program more thoroughly or know for example what line the autograder is referring to when it mentions line 6 and 10 thanks
student,i submitted essentially the same code to the autograder twice the only change was that i split one of my code lines into two code lines so the line was less than 80 characters i noticed that when i made this change the fracyears case went from taking 0001 seconds to 0003 seconds and the long case went from taking 0037 seconds to 0028 seconds does anyone know why the time to complete the test cases would change when it is the same test case and the code stayed the same just curiousthanks

student,sorry but im just confused the equations stated in the instructions doc says that we can find either the balance of the current month or next month using b b p b r12 b b 1 r12 p but my question is where do i get b b from to my understanding p is the monthly payment that was submitted by the user r interest rate submitted by the user only knowing these i cant really use the formulas given i know i missing something though
student,can anybody explain what this means build warningserrors build output g wall werror pedantic o1 iocpp p1cpp o p1 be sure to use o3 on each compile line

student,im not exactly sure how to check for an integer value for years if i cannot use the mathh library because i cannot use modulo on a double any ideas
student,are we allowed to include mathh i was hoping to use fmod
student,i was looking at the final slide in todays lecture regarding resource costs of iteration and recursion and i wasnt able to draw any specific conclusion what i did find was that both cases involve x multiplications the recursive case involves x1 stack frames and x1 integers the iterative case involves x1 comparisons x decrements one stack frame and 2 integers did anyone find anything different and is there any way to verify from this information that one algorithm is superior in regard to resource management if i had to guess it seems like iteration would be more efficient when x is sufficiently large because of the number of variables and stack frames that would have to be utilized in the recursive case any other thoughts
student,why is the outstanding balance in month 12 in the table in the spec not 0
student,how long after a lecture should it be posted online i missed lecture 2 this morning and wanted to watch it thanks for any help
student,hey everyone i cant find anyone else with this issue but for some reason i keep getting this error syntax error near unexpected token no matter what program i run be it project 1 or a simple hello world i can compile just fine but the error pops up when it tries to run i dont have any characters in the code nor do i have single quotation marks it also only shows up for the first instance of parentheses typically the first function im not sure why it cant recognize a parentheses i have a feeling theres something obvious im missing this is all in red hat through the vnc program im working in gedit and using the command line given in the spec i have the three include statements im working in the bash shell do i need to use a different editor or change the shell or make sure everything is encoded the same way

student,are the office hours taking place in 1833 east hall still on for 1000
student,my error checking for the loan duration weeds out decimals just fine but whenever i put a fraction in it passes the test only using the numerator for the duration i was thinking about converting duration to a string and using find to look for a character is there an easier way of going about this
student,what should we do about the fraction years round it up down or ask for reinput
student,so i am having some issues compiling this is what i type in and what the terminal spits back at me i dont understand what its getting at because in each instance that i call getparam it only has three arguments as it should each with the correct type string double double could it be a result of a long string value being put in for the string argument this is really my only thought as to what it could be any help would be appreciated thanks in advance
student,is there a difference between the submit280 script mentioned in the project outline and the autograder that was pinned here on piazza if so where could i find it i may have just missed it on ctools if it is already there

student,so i wrote my code in xcode and it works fine and passed the autograder however when i try to use the g compiler it says that there is no such file or directory for iocpp and p1cpp does this mean my code is incorrect for linux or am i just missing something obvious
student,i have passed the auto grader test cases and i have checked border conditions could someone please give me suggestions as to what other test cases i should test out thanks
student,good evening when i try to run p1cpp in the linux terminal with the given examplestest cases and some extreme cases i make myself the results come out exactly as they should however it keeps getting 06 test cases correct from the autograder i was wondering if someone could give me some insight on what these errors mean i get this exact same message 6 times test case example failed runtime sec 0003 memory usage kb 1268 line 1 correct output r th truncated at position 45 student output r in truncated at position 45 much appreciated
student,i was looking through piazza and saw that some of the instructors showed an output that included the last month where the balance is zero ex principle interest bal 13 0 but in the project description it did not include this month is our code supposed to include that month
student,where should i go to get a list of the readings that we are suggested to complete before our lectures couldnt find it on the syllabus or the calendar thanks
student,finished with the project wondering if theres any way to start on the lab early or if there was any work i could do in preparation
student,upon uploading my file to the autograder i get this error test case payment failed runtime sec 0003 memory usage kb 1272 line 1 correct output e mo truncated at position 49 student output e in truncated at position 49 however diff between the output1 file and the output of my command is clean caenproject1 mterwil g pedantic wall werror o1 p1cpp iocpp o p1 caenproject1 mterwil p1 test1 testout caenproject1 mterwil diff testout output1 caenproject1 mterwil any ideas
student,i have found that when testing my code with some extreme inputs such as 1 monthly payment 1 annual interest and 1 year of loan or 9999999 monthly payment 100 interest rate and 1 year of loan because my code calculates the table information to several places past the decimal point some of the numbers in the table since they are rounded to the hundredths place are off by 1 cent this is not a problem with more reasonable test cases the code outputs the test example given in the prompt correctly and has passed all of the public tests in the autograder it also does not occur in every extreme test case eg all output seems to be correct when input is 100000 monthly payment 100 annual interest and 1 year of loan is this a calculationrounding problem that i should be concerned about if so is there a way to remedy it
student,i passed all the test cases but the autograder tells me my brace style is inconsistent on lines 6 and 10 but there is nothing on line 6 and no braces on line 10 also where a i supposed to type the command line in the command prompt im using vs
student,i understand how the last equation given in the project file can find you any months balance based on the balance of the month after it what i dont understand is how you start the loop then because i dont know what the initial values would be to start the equation with i know balance would be zero because at the end everything is paid off and monthly payment and interest rate are constant but how do we initialize principal it seems it converges to the monthly payment amount so i tried starting it off with that and got the slightly different results problem
student,hi all this may be a basic question but i am still unclear on whether years has to be the rigorous definition of an integer such as 1 2 3 4 5 or whether values such as 1000 200 are valid as well thanks
student,for some reason whenever i try to compile my iocpp file i get a decent amount of compiling errors even in my ioh which is literally copy pasted from the project1pdf i get the errors ioh5 error expected unqualifiedid before ‘double’ ioh5 error expected constructor destructor or type conversion before ‘double’ line 5 in the ioh file is where getparam is declared
student,hey i manually ran my code with the example integers given in the spec and got a table identical to the output in the spec i used however i still have truncated at position feedback from the autograder for every case can anyone explain thanks
student,for the prompts that ask the user to type in information i tried putting double sets of quotations around the strings but my program only works when i use a single set of quotations however i thought we need both sets because one set is used for the string declaration and the other is used in the string itself
student,few questions 1 would a student need to have some sort of documentationname class project etc at the top of the cpp file being submissi n 2 is there a need to add comments to the code to describe what each part is doing 3 just for clarification because i think i read it elsewhere but cant find the source now is the final submission to the autograder the one that is graded by the graders answers to the aforementioned questions will be greatly appreciated premature thanks to anyone with helpful answers
student,the way i figured out how to do this was to calculate the principalinterest and balance of each month separately so that means 3 calculations per month which would lead to quite a bit of code would it be a good idea to make these three calculations into a function and just call that every time or is there an even more efficient way to approach this problem please help
student,i submitted my code in the autograder and it works for all the test cases but under the style errors section it said i checked the line and the number of characters was 67 or so even with the spaces it was 77 i tried using a different text editor emacs but it still gave me the same comment when sumbitted my file does the autograder also consider the tabs in a line in the number of characters
student,for good style should we be commenting in brief descriptions of how we got to any formulas used that werent given to us
student,i am having trouble running my code in the caenlinux environment but i decided to try submitting to autograder anyway i passed all the test cases so im wondering if that means my code is compatible with the caenlinux environment in other words if your program passes the ag can you expect it to run smoothly in linux as well
student,my project runs very well under linux enviroment but when i submited it to autograder i got feedback like the following but im very confued about what it means build warningserrors p1cpp1 error stray ‘177’ in program p1cpp1 error stray ‘2’ in program p1cpp1 error stray ‘1’ in program p1cpp1 error stray ‘1’ in program p1cpp18 error null characters ignored p1cpp1 error stray ‘2’ in program p1cpp118 error null characters ignored p1cpp120 error null characters ignored p1cpp1 error stray ‘1’ in program p1cpp122 error null characters ignored p1cpp1 error stray ‘360’ in program p1cpp1 error stray ‘’ in program p1cpp128 error null characters ignored p1cpp1 error stray ‘’ in program p1cpp134 error null characters ignored p1cpp1 error stray ‘270’ in program p1cpp1 error stray ‘33’ in program p1cpp143 error null characters ignored p1cpp1 error stray ‘’ in program p1cpp154 error null characters ignored p1cpp156 error null characters ignored p1cpp1 error stray ‘10’ in program p1cpp158 error null characters ignored p truncated output make exited with nonzero exit status be sure to include a makefile and not to put your files in any subdirectorysubfolder in your submittgz if make works locally check to be sure that you are not relying on builtin variablesrules by running make r r total points earned 00 for code 00 points
student,i failed one test on the autograder and it seems to be truncating incorrectly but the code that was given to us does the formatting so i am not sure if i am interpreting this incorrectly what is my mistake here
student,im trying to work on the project at caen lab i rebooted the computer and chose the linux system im now editing the file with gedit which i can actually select and click with gui however im wondering how can i compile my code under the linux system is there a program i should use or how can i get access to the terminal within the gui thanks
student,test case years failed runtime sec 0003 memory usage kb 1208 line 1 correct output s p truncated at position 112 student output s truncated at position 112 is the only test case i fail 56 looking at that i thought that it was because of the trailing space but its not as i checked and i have a trailing space i checked for other posts with similar questions and the answer they have received is to check for the trailing space im confused
student,my auto grader gives me this for all test cases i really dont understand what this means thanks test case years failed runtime sec 0003 memory usage kb 1268 line 4 correct output 12 student output 1
student,i have been able to pass 56 of the available test cases but can not figure out what the issue is with the long test case doing test runs with long time periods 100 years it seems as though the payments made start off at month 1 very small and grow towards the entered monthly payment however this behavior is also shown in the provided test case on the project1pdf the payments decrease down the month listing the fact that im passing the other 5 test cases leads me to believe that there isnt an issue with my understanding of the problem but instead theres something very small that im overlooking has anyone else had an issue with passing the long test case initially
student,i am using xcode on my macbook to do project 1 and i am confused about how i hand in the project i submitted the project to the autograder without ever logging into linux or accessing a terminal is it enough to just turn in the project using the autograder link
student,does 66 mean my project is 100 in terms of correctness
student,in the style guide it states all functions you write must have an rme clause see lecture 2 slides writing your rme clauses above the function prototype can improve readability do we put the rme for the function in the p1cpp file or in the iocpp file
student,i seem to be having the same issue i have seen in other comments on here with truncation and rounding i cant figure out why setprecision in printmonthlydata is rounding my numbers when i cout the interest on its own i get the right answer but when i use the given printmonthlydata it is rounding my numbers incorrectly i am only off by one decimal but no matter what i try i cant get this decimal to change i know we are not supposed to change printmonthlydata so whats the best way to go about fixing this
student,i have a working program that i am trying to compile in caen linux environment though remote access when i try to compile i get this warning p1cpp46 error getparam was not declared in this scope and same error for the other two functions as well so correct me if i am wrong but i thought the command g pedantic wall werror –o1 p1cpp iocpp o p1 was supposed to combine p1cpp and iocpp into a single execitable named p1 despite this am i supposed to declare functions that are defined in iocpp in p1cpp as well thanks
student,i am writing my code in the same directory as iocpp but how do i get the information from iocpp to work together with the code i write do i include it at the top of my code
student,i virtually connected to a caen computer to try to test my code in a linux environment but once i was on the desktop i couldnt figure out what to do i wasnt sure where i was supposed to go to try to test out my project i tried reading the quick reference guides but i couldnt figure out how to get my file on the virtual desktop or where to run it how can i test my project
student,in the project spec it says that if you are willing to pay 500 a month for 5 years at an interest rate of 6 you could take a loan of 2586278 could someone who has already passed the autograder tests verify this my project is giving me a different answer although the test case with 100 6 and 1 year it gives the exact same answer thank you

student,where are the office hours on monday being held
student,i see that we are only allowed to use the c standard libraries in our program is iomanip a c standard library
student,are there any specific guidelines for submitting projects for example do we need to have our name section date etc listed at the top
student,when i try to compile my code i get the following error g –o1 no such file or directory i think it means that it cant find the ioh of iocpp file but theyre both in the right directory
student,i just ran my project through the autograder and it said i passed whatever base test cases you it gave me however it also detailed a memory budget of 1 kb which is pretty small and i went significantly over it it still says i passed the tests but is memory something we should worry about for this project thanks
student,i finished my code in vs and i am under the linux system but i have no idea where i should type the command or where i should compile my project in linux
student,i used vs and xcode before i have not used linux but i know the commandssry for this dumb question but i donot know what to do after i access to the linux terminals i type in g and nothing happens
student,please keep in mind that the autograder does not assign grades project grades also take style efficiency and other deliverables into account test cases used for grading may be completely different than those used to evaluate trial submissions checking for unexpected file patterns note any file with two leading underscores or the extensions o stderr stdout will be deleted case will be ignored checking for style errors found 303 tokens in source if this number significantly exceeds the average reported for all students your source code is too bloated and needs to be reduced in size iocpp ascii c program text inconsistent brace style lines 610 choose between the following two styles and be consistent if or if p1cpp ascii c program text with crlf line terminators ok ioh ascii c program text ok all expected files found build warningserrors build output g wall werror pedantic o1 iocpp p1cpp o p1 be sure to use o3 on each compile line scoring student executable test case years passed runtime sec 0002 runtime budget sec 1000 memory usage kb 1268 memory budget kb 1 you measured 1010 for this test case test case rate passed runtime sec 0003 runtime budget sec 1000 memory usage kb 1272 memory budget kb 1 you measured 1010 for this test case test case payment passed runtime sec 0003 runtime budget sec 1000 memory usage kb 1268 memory budget kb 1 you measured 1010 for this test case test case long failed runtime sec 0029 memory usage kb 1268 line 4 correct output 925 truncated at position 30 student output 999 truncated at position 30 test case fracyears passed runtime sec 0003 runtime budget sec 1000 memory usage kb 1264 memory budget kb 1 you measured 1010 for this test case test case example passed runtime sec 0003 runtime budget sec 1000 memory usage kb 1268 memory budget kb 1 you measured 1010 for this test case you passed 5 out of 6 test cases measuring 5060 total points earned 50 for code 50 points
student,the specifications say that the years input must be an integer does this mean that we must declare the years input as an int or is this direction only referring to the fact that we must call getparam again if the user tries to enter a double in and there is no restriction on the type for the years variable i had been under the assumption that we were able to declare it as a double at least but i wanted to make sure im not misunderstanding anything thanks
student,if the user enters a double are we supposed to just roundfloorcast to an int or do we need a loop to call getparam again until they get it right and if so how do we check for it with a loop if we cant edit the getparam function itself ive heard people went about this a lot of different ways but im still unsure
student,i am wondering the number of white spaces of table for example how many white spaces between each number in a row
student,should int main be in p1cpp
student,hi i have done the project1 and it works well if compiled using only g p1cpp or g pedantic wall werror o1 p1cpp however if i type the whole line g pedantic wall werror o1 p1cpp iocpp o p1 it gives strange errors does anybody know whats going on error uplicate symbol z8getparamssdd in varfolders8vvvzzghx233bllpvrn161jw0000gntp167d7cfo varfolders8vvvzzghx233bllpvrn161jw0000gntio76da35o duplicate symbol z11printheaderv in varfolders8vvvzzghx233bllpvrn161jw0000gntp167d7cfo varfolders8vvvzzghx233bllpvrn161jw0000gntio76da35o duplicate symbol z16printmonthlydataiddd in varfolders8vvvzzghx233bllpvrn161jw0000gntp167d7cfo varfolders8vvvzzghx233bllpvrn161jw0000gntio76da35o ld 3 duplicate symbols for architecture x8664 clang error linker command failed with exit code 1 use v to see invocation
student,sorry if this is a dumb question but on the spec the example shows month principal interest 12 9959 041 11 9917 083 10 9876 124 9 9835 165 8 9794 206 7 9754 246 6 9713 287 5 9673 327 4 9633 367 3 9593 407 2 9553 447 1 9513 487 balance 9959 19876 29752 39587 49381 59135 68848 78521 88153 97746 107299 116812 so how come the balance starts at 9959 and not 100 also i dont understand what it means when it says that the monthly payment is first used to pay off the interest and then the remainder is applied to the principal
student,im really confused about how i should start the project i understand how to get the values for all months but the first one for some reason im clueless even though i feel like its not too difficult any hint or help would really be appreciated thanks
student,when using the code to test for differences in my code versus the output p1 test1 testout diff testout output1 i receive the following output of 15a16 which after some research ive found that the output1 file has an extra line of whitespace in the end of the file the output1 should be 15 lines but there is actually a 16th line of nothing just space is this crucial or is this minor difference very unsubstantial im asking especially because the project specs note that you should therefore definitely pass this test case and im not passing it right now due to that final white space thanks
student,i cant find it in the project directory
student,i may just be understanding the project specs wrong but here is my issue i wrote the beginning of my p1cpp acquiring the input from the user from what i understand iocpp and ioh have already declared this procedure what should i do to declare getparam in my p1cpp
student,should we be following a specific format for writing our names uniqname project date and other information of that sort on the first few lines of the project like what was done for engineering 101 i couldnt find any information about this in the project spec or style guidelines
student,im a little rusty with my programming and im trying to remember how i run my code once i compile it this is what i have in my terminal bash41 g pedantic wall werror o1 p1cpp iocpp o p1 bash41 thanks
student,is there a sign up sheet for office hours at ugli i know its held in the area by the computers
student,how do i go about accessing the caen account on university computers also should the entire project be done on a university computer or should i code it in xcode first and then copy it onto a linux terminal on a caen account thanks
student,i know how to submit it using the autograder but is this where we submit our final project or is there another place we are supposed to submit the final code thanks
student,i declared and defined functions of my own in header and class files respectively i used the include p1 in my main function when i try to call a function from the p1 class in main though xcode is saying that im using an undeclared identifier not sure how to rectify this problem thanks
student,is anyone else having issues with caen im trying to log into linux and i receive a bunch of errors could not update iceauthority file there is a problem with the configuration server nautilus could not create the following required folders before running nautilus please create these folders or set permissions such that nautilus can create them your ifs home directory does not appear to exist on my desktop there are no folders it was working fine yesterday im wondering if this has to do with the email professor ringenberg sent to his w14 101 classperhaps someone knows what im talking abouti followed the steps he sent out
student,hello is there any way to know what is the average number of tokens reported for all students thank you
student,when i compile my code i get this error tmpccllhrbxo in function main p1cpptext0xdc undefined reference to getparamstdbasicstringchar stdchartraitschar stdallocatorchar double double collect2 ld returned 1 exit status im not sure what this means or how i should fix it anyone have any ideas
student,correct output e mo truncated at position 49 student output e in truncated at position 49 i am not sure what this error is referring to i passed every test except this one
student,it is supposed to be an instructor on dicussion section to talk about some caen account and its usage of remote desktop control however no one appears for this week discussion so for those students who use microsoft visual studio or xcode they may have questions about linux termnals can somebody give the introduction of some basic commands
student,i submitted my project to the autograder and passed 56 test cases for the test case years the autograder feedback was test case years failed runtime sec 0003 memory usage kb 1204 line 1 correct output s p truncated at position 112 student output s truncated at position 112 im not sure what this means so i was hoping someone could help explain what this is saying is wrong thanks
student,i submitted my code to autograder and i passed 5 out of 6 tests for test case fracyears i got feedback like this test case fracyears failed runtime sec 0003 memory usage kb 1264 line 1 correct output s p truncated at position 112 student output s truncated at position 112 im having trouble understanding what this means what kind of error is this thanks
student,when i go to the google drive page project1 i am unable to openview the files for test1 and output1 could that be because i just set up my caen account so it isnt activated yet if not how do i view them
student,ok so it appears that i have figured out how to get the initial month statistics right but i guess i am a little confused about how to update the outstanding balance i guess i dont understand exactly how the loan works anyone have any advice
student,should we consider the condition that years or principal or interest is negative
student,when i attempt to compile my code i get the following compiler error name lookup of variblename’ changed for iso ‘for’ scoping in my code i initialize a variable in the header of my for loop i then pass that variable into a function inside the body of the for loop is there something fundamentally wrong with this approach any thoughts would be appreciated thanks in advance
student,will we get marked off for style if we use magic numbers in this project
student,in the auto grader i keep getting build warningserrors build output g wall werror pedantic o1 iocpp p1cpp o p1 be sure to use o3 on each compile line and then scoring student executable at least one test case passed at least one test case passed can anyone tell me what this means and what the problem could be
student,as i test i realize that the user can enter a monthly loan with values past the hundredths place 100324 for example should i be considering this possibilty if so im trying to determine whether it would be best to round up or down in such a case if only one will considered correct when grading
student,i am confused by the directions in the project spec do we need to write functions like getparam and printheader or just include the library the functions are in and write the code where we will call the prewritten functions thanks
student,im sorry if it is a silly question but if we input some characters rather than numbers the getparam function would never stop so do we need to consider the character problem
student,in the case of getparam on duration of the loans in years should the program ask for a redo if the input has a decimal for instance if someone inputs 10 should the program ask for the parameter again or should it accept the answer since technically 10 is a whole number and could be considered an integer
student,i am wondering how we turn our projects in once we submit it into the auto grader will you be sent the most recent version or is there another place we need to submit it
student,hello the question i have regards an uncertainty i perceive in the project specification on page 2 it says note that you must do a small amount of additional error checking on the years input if the user enters something other than an integer number of years call getparam again with the same promptlimits then it says you do not need to handle any erroneous inputfor example a user who types foo instead of 005 you may assume that we will always supply numbers when they are expected but that the numbers might be outside the allowable range according to the iocpp source file that range error checking is already done for us so really the only error checking we need to do is the term of the loan being a whole number is that correct
student,where in the ugli basement are office hours generally hosted
student,im trying to decipher what the auto grader is telling me test case long failed runtime sec 0028 memory usage kb 1272 line 4 correct output 19 truncated at position 6 student output 9 truncated at position 6 is line 4 referring to line 4 in my cpp file or my output or also what is position 6 referring to
student,hello i am wondering is there an specific functions in the c library that can check if a number is an integer
student,sorry if this is a dumb question how do i calculate the initial balance or the total loan amount given the parameters thanks
student,does it matter what distribution of linux we write our projects and if it is different from the one caen uses thanks
student,the autograder is telling me that i have inconsistent brace style referencing two lines that are in my comment section but im not sure why my brace style is consistent any ideas for why im getting this notice thanks in advance
student,my program failed the long test case with this error but i dont completely understand the error message so im not sure how im supposed to go about fixing it any help or pointers if available would be much appreciated test case long failed runtime sec 1811 memory usage kb 1180 the program was stopped with signal sigxfsz your program exceeded the output limit
student,on 03sep14 500 pm charles kowalec wrote hi i was just wondering if we are allowed to use ides like xcode or visual studio to write these projects instead of using the linux vnc moreover would the cpp files written in a c ide compile without error in the autograder thank your for your time sincerely charlie on sep 3 2014 530 pm vidalumichedu vidalumichedu wrote hi charlie you are free to use whatever ide you want while developing your code however your code must compile and run correctly on a caen linux machine if not it will not pass the autograder it will be your responsibility to make sure that that is the case vidal
student,hi just want to know whether the discussion tomorrow at 1 pm is cancelled or not thanks
student,found 400 tokens in source if this number significantly exceeds the average reported for all students your source code is too bloated and needs to be reduced in size i got this message in the autograder and im not sure what exactly tokens means nor how this corresponds to the average reported for all students if someone could explain this for me i would greatly appreciate it
student,could someone please explain this to me from the project 1 direction sheet when you compile your program you should use the following command line g pedantic wall werror –o1 p1cpp iocpp o p1 i just submitted my p1cpp file from xcode and it didnt work and gave me a bunch of errors i feel like i am not submitting it in the correct way thank you
student,maybe this doesnt apply to this first project but for later projects if we get all pass does that mean we are completely correct or will even more test cases be tested beyond what the autograder does
student,i completed my project 1 in visual studio on a caen computer and have been trying to run it on caen environment i opened the command and typed in g pedantic wall werror o1 p1cpp iocpp o p1 and got a message saying g is not recognizable as internal or external command operable program or batch file i am totally new to linux and never used commands before can someone please tell me whats going on if you can give a detailed set of instructions on how to run my code written in an ide under the caen linux environment i will very much appreciate it thanks in advance
student,i have noticed that a few of my numbers always differ in the hundredths place when compared to the test case when i do calculations for the first months interest 100 005 12 i get a number that is 041666666 but the output for the interest is 041 so the trailing 6s need to be truncated however for other numbers i have noticed that rounding gave me the correct hundredths place which one should i stick to is the correct output possible by using only one
student,hi i received this message under build warningserrors from autograder build output g wall werror pedantic o1 iocpp p1cpp o p1 be sure to use o3 on each compile line any idea on how to solve this
student,i submitted p1cpp to the autograder and failed the fracyears test case i am confused as to what the fracyears error is is it when the user inputs something other than an integer or something else
student,on the sample output give can someone please explain how the first number in the interest column is foundcalculated thanks
student,i have a pc can i use microsoft vs for this class if not what programs can i use
student,is is okay to use the cmath library for the first project i cant seem to figure out how to check if the year is in fact an integer value for the third call to the getparam function without using the cmath library
student,just to clarify if the number of years is greater than one should the month number just start from number of years12 or do we have to use a different format for example if the number of years is 2 do we just start from 24 and go all the way down to 1 or do we specify the year number and start from 12 twice
student,the bonus question about generalising the ball algorithm for n balls should be submitted how

student,do we need an iclicker for our first day or at all thanks
student,where is the project1 directory located
student,can someone give some detailed instructions on how to download the programming software were going to need for this class… especially for a macbook in 183 we just used xcode thanks
student,sorry if this is a silly question but are we to only modify the iocpp file and leave the h file alone
student,will all lecture sections receive the same projects to do in other words can we partner with someone who is in another lecture section than ours to do the projects
student,are we able to attend any lecture section even if it is the not the one we are signed up for how about for discussion sections
student,for the projects in this class i am trying to find my way around the linux environments we will need to use i am able to get into the vnc client for connecting to caen but i am not exactly sure which of the programming tools in the client we are supposed to use for this class thanks
student,if we are just learning the language do we need to buy the book i mean we can find information and technology details all around in the internet and library besides we also have the lecture slides
student,hi im just wondering whether it is okay to use the book from the fall 2013 semester for this course or is it better to purchase the new book for the upcoming semester thanks
student,am i correct in assuming that month 12 the first month printed is where we begin accumulating the loan amt with the balance at month 1 at the bottom being the solution and regarding the formula in computing the first months balance principal and interest exactly how do we work in the given equation of b b 1r12 p seeing how we dont have any prior knowledge of the previous months balance i initially thought on your first month of paying itd begin as 100 and then youd start multiplying by r12 every month to calculate interest
student,piazza is a qa platform designed to get you great answers from classmates and instructors fast weve put together this list of tips you might find handy as you get started 1 ask questions the best way to get answers is to ask questions ask questions on piazza rather than emailing your teaching staff so everyone can benefit from the response and so you can get answers from classmates who are up as late as you are 2 edit questions and answers wikistyle think of piazza as a qa wiki for your class every question has just a single students answer that students can edit collectively and a single instructors’ answer for instructors 3 add a followup to comment or ask further questions to comment on or ask further questions about a post start a followup discussion mark it resolved when the issue has been addressed and add any relevant information back into the qa above 4 go anonymous shy no problem you can always opt to post or edit anonymously 5 tag your posts its far more convenient to find all posts about your homework 3 or midterm 1 when the posts are tagged type a “” before a key word to tag click a blue tag in a post or the question feed to filter for all posts that share that tag 6 format code and equations adding a code snippet click the pre or tt button in the question editor to add preformatted or inline teletype text mathematical equation click the fx button to access the latex editor to build a nicely formatted equation 7 view and download class details and resources click the course page button in your top bar to access the class syllabus staff contact information office hours details and course resources—all in one place contact the piazza team anytime with questions or comments at teampiazzacom we love feedback

student,can i retake this course in spring if i passed and didnt get a thanks
student,before grades after grades shoutout to the entire 280 staff for all your hard work and help real talk tho the lack of gifs on this piazza page was appalling
student,anyone have any details about how the class will be curved
student,will we have a chance to see what we did wrong on our exams
student,i never received a grade for my lab 1 i assume this is an error what should i do
student,stomps feet and holds breath in childlike manner
student,i will assume that we arent allowed to host our course code on online repositories such as github
student,i was just wondering when project 6 will be released looking forward to getting a headstart
student,we are told that the exams are to be graded within 24 hours but when will our final exam scores be released
student,is it possible to check with a gsi to clarify the comments in my handgrading report before i submit a regrade request i noticed that there are no more office hours on the gcalendar
student,can your chickens lay eggs recursively httpwwwiflsciencecomplantsandanimalshenlaideggwithineggfindouthow
student,are there typically an opportunity for regrade requests for the final exam like will we be able to see our graded final before or final grade is posted
student,hip hip hip hip array
student,or do we go to our room according to our uniqname and stay longer
student,in lecture 16 on memory models prof deorio went over a couple potential pitfalls with using delete these were 1 trying to delete a dynamic variable twice int p new int delete p delete p error 2 trying to delete a local variable int i 0 local variable int p i pointer to local variable delete p error would these cause an error at compile time or runtime
student,what happens if the catch type doesnt match the throw type is this automatically a run time error or will it return to the stackframe above it if there is a catch in the stackframe above it will it then have the opportunity to catch the thrown type
student,could you do something like isosceles is triangle t is or triangle tis what about triangle t isosceles is t is would this just be a matter of upcasting implicitly
student,is a destructor supposed to clean up any code that elements inside it might point to so for example a list wouldnt worry about if it is holding pointers to dynamic variables would it
student,lets say you have main listint k kpopback2 listint j jpopback2 when the main function ends the list destructor runs which list technically gets deleted first and which gets deleted second
student,if you have a listint li and you iterate through the nodes to get to the datum you would only have to deference it once to get to the datum
student,the cheat sheet for the final is one piece of paper front and back correct
student,where is the stamps
student,list operator const list rhs why do we not need listt the second time
student,im doing lab 11 to study right now late i know and im just really confused as to where to start how can we determine what kind of animal an animal object is so that we can count the number of given animals i dont remember any functions or anything in class that return the subtype of a variable help
student,im a bit confused in terms of manually deleting vs having a destructor called at the end of main for 4a what do no destructors get called at the end what is an example that it would be called automatically instead
student,in this lecture slide we are told that not using an initializer list creates a temporary variable i know this is bad practice but does it actually change how the code works i tested myself and didnt notice a difference
student,if data is a pointer to an array of ints what is the correct way to access an element at index i in that array my initial instinct was datai to dereference data to get to the array and then use to get to the element but is that incorrect would datai still give you element i also since just the variable name of an array is a ptr to the first element would datai be equivalent to the element at index i or datai
student,so ive been playing around with this and i am confused to have the program choose the right function at runtime based off dynamic type you need a virtual function however does the virtual function have to be declared virtual in the static type view these two examples 1 class parent code void print cout parent print endl not virtual class child public parent code virtual void print cout child print endl yes virtual class grandchild public child code virtual void print cout grandchild print endl yes virtual example 1 int main parent p new child static type is parent dynamic type is child pprint virtual for child class dynamic type not for parent class static output parent print example 2 int main child c new grandchild static type is child dynamic type is grandchild pprint virtual for both classes output grandchild print so in summary does it have to be virtual in the static types class or rather in both static dynamic types classes in option 2 why did it not matter that the base class did not declare print virtual yes i have tried running this on my own
student,i came across a question that asked about this which one is it
student,say the destructors were not declared virtual and we have three classes parent child and grandchild i am wondering how only partially deleting an object might happen please consider this code and see the main function class parent int x parent nonvirtual class child public parent bool true child class grandchild pubic child double z grandchild int main child c new grandchild dynamic type is grandchild delete c child dtor runs parent dtor runs question what exactly is leaked the question what part of the grandchild object was leaked on the heap my understanding is that the grandchild object would have had three variables on the stack an int a bool and a double would the child dtor and parent dtor have deallocated the space of their member variables just the int and the bool and left the double leaked am i thinking about this wrong thanks
student,what is the symbol called
student,if class a has a protected member variable named int blah and there is a class b which is a derived class of a then b can access int blah can b access int blah from outside the class implementation in main eg classbgetblah
student,i know constructors arent inherited but are destructors also what does it really mean if they are or not
student,i had a quick question about the following slide i thought private member variables of a parent class is not inherited but the slide is showing that it is am i reading this slide wrong or is there something i am missing
student,hello i understand that types and functions are not first classobjects but are templates and function pointers considered first class prof deorio only mentioned that they come close so it is it correct to assume that they are not thanks
student,lets say you have a functor that will call a function on whatever the overloaded operator is passed how would you store a function pointer syntax wise would it look like one of these private int funbool b or int fun bool b public
student,when do we need to have parentheses after using new when dont in our lecture new gorilla doesnt have parentheses but new string has parentheses so what is the rule of using parentheses thank you
student,i just want to make sure but the only thing we have to do after copying and swapping is delete other right
student,in lecture 19 slide 19 pushfrontcolo is okay where colo is a gorilla because this is a listgorilla but then it says pushfrontnew gorilla is better but isnt new gorilla just a gorilla and not a gorilla so why is this able to work
student,can we say that the biggest difference between functors and function pointers is that functors are first class will function pointers are not if you think it is hard to define biggest just tell me if functors are first class and function pointers are not thank you very much
student,is it right for us to say templates are an example of compiletime polymorphism is it right to say that iterators for templated data containers must also be templated i think both of them are right but not for sure can anyone tell me the certainly right answer thank you very much if you can explain what is compile time polymorphism that will be better
student,can anyone explain the spring 2a question in more detail like how you come to starting this problem ive looked at all the current piazza questions on it and im still a little lost
student,when declaring an iterator do we always use listtypeiterator or is it nameofclassiterator for the second option are we using the name of the class that the iterator is within
student,on slides 26 and 27 of the exceptions lecture the catch block appears to take an argument im a little fuzzy on why catch needs access to any sort of data and why in this particular example its an integer can anyone help me out
student,hello i understand that you cannot create an instance of an abstract class however is a class considered abstract even if it has one pure virtual function along with other normal functions i thought that a class had to have all pure virtual functions in order to be considered abstract in context fall 2014 3a 2 thanks
student,for this question you have written a class that has a destructor thats a pretty good sign that it probably also needs which of the following circle all that apply a a pure virtual function b a copy constructor c an overloaded assignment operator d a get function e a set function can somebody please tell me the answer im pretty sure it isnt d or e but i am not sure for the others since it want all that apply thanks for the help
student,so lets say i have a pointer to memory on thhe heap and i delete it and set it to 0 can you execute delete on that ptr thats set to 0 is that valid because i thought it would depend on the compiler like if this were a true or false which would it be
student,the questions states that we cannot use lists member variable does that include not being able to use iterators made in list
student,for the generatereversedcopy function of 2a i was confused about how we create new copies of the pointedto monsters i start by creating a new monsterarmy and proceeding to insert monsters in the reverse order using addmonster for example not worrying about actually adding in reverse order in the code below does the addmonster function create a new copy of the pointedto monster in the iterator or will the two monster lists end up pointing to the same locations if the latter is true how do we create new copies of these monster pointers monsteriterator iter otherbegin monsterarmy reverse new monsterarmy reverseaddmonsteriter
student,lets say i have three classes parent child and grandchild is it ever okay to call the parent constructor in the grandchild constructor like so grandchild int a parenta i tried this and got parentparent is not a direct or virtual base of grandchild what does that meanwhy is it important if it is okay to do in certain circumstances like abc vs not abc or if maybe the child class did not have a custom constructor what if i call grandchild int a childa and child does not have a custom constructor defined but parent does will it automatically run the parent one
student,should we be expected to be able to write exceptions trycatch blocks even though we never practice writing them in projects or labs
student,why is it that the same destructors are called more than once i dont have examples of code for this hopefully this can be answered generally
student,is it possible to combine polymorphism with functors say for example you had a parent functor anyn which just had a pure virtual overloaded function call operator then you tried to derive lessn from anyn is something like this syntactically possible
student,1 do iterators must have typename t 2 if an uncaught exception propagates to main and main does not catch it what happens
student,so i know that local variable is automatically deleted when it goes out of scope if i have a function foo int foo int hi new int3 and i dont delete hi inside the foo does it get automatically deleted or will it cause memory leak
student,for the syntax of the iterator loop look through all of the monsters does it look like monsterarmy iterator i or listmonsterarmy iterator i i am confused if we should use the template list here because i know we dont see it in the class declaration but i am not sure if i have seen the other syntax before please and thank you
student,how do you apply the downcast can someone provide an thorough example other than that used in class
student,when should we return this when writing a function
student,ive been trying to find a difference between encapsulation and abstraction and ive read a bunch of different posts on it but i cant seem to find a consistent definition that i understand would someone be willing to explain this is what i understand so far encapsulation is just grouping dataimplementations together so a function is encapsulation your encapsulating the implementation of the function as is a class youre encapsulating all of the methods and all of the member variables abstraction is where you have code that works for multiple different types so if you write a program that works for any animal you could put in a dog cat hamster am i correct
student,will 7 in 3a has an output of fishs num fish consumed was called thanks
student,prof deorio briefly mentioned how c made iterators easier to use in the new version of c but we dont have to know how to do it this way correct
student,example code class games class boards public games class checkers public boards int main games g boards b checkers c using this formula derivedtype ptr dynamiccastderivedtype parenttype obj for a dynamiccast to be successful does the dynamic type of obj have to be the same as derivedtype after a dynamiccast successful or otherwise what is the ptr s dynamic type please consider the questions in the following scenarios this should work boards bptr c bptr dynamic type should now be checkers checkers cptr dynamiccastcheckers bptr should cast just fine question cptrs dynamic type should be what happens here games gptr g dynamic type of gptr is also games checkers cptr dynamiccastcheckersgptr question does this return null question if this does return null is cptrs dynamic type a null i found that when a dynamiccast fails i can still call nonvirtual functions just fine with the pointer but problems arise when i try to call virtual functions final question 3 could someone please explain to me what is happening under the hood when a dynamiccast is made like what object of memory is it actually changing the type of the pointer where the pointer points to
student,im having a bit of confusion understanding templates and factory functionsif templates resolve statically how can you have a factory function that actually works so for example int main animal asdf factoryfunc returns pointer to a dog cat or hamster both func1 and func2 are templated to accept any animal asdffunc1asdf asffunc2asdf how can this work if func1 and func2 must know at compile time what type of animal they are accepting when this is not found until runtime form factoryfunc thanks
student,1h except for address zero its safe to deallocate the same memory address twice i said it was false because as long as the pointer is pointing to something you can deallocate it whether the address is zero or not could someone confirm this and maybe even give an example it would much appreciated thanks
student,if you had a parent class and child class and you created a pointer as such parent obj new child if there was a function only defined in child called childfunction that was not virtual would this result in an error objchildfunction thanks
student,after going through many practice problems testing knowledge of polymorphism and derived classes such as the benderhk42 problem and the dory problem im pretty confused as to which function prototypes execute and when for example if the base class has a void getname function that produces output and a derived class also has a void getname function what happens when you call get name on the derived class object what if both the derived class and the base class have virtual void getname functions each with its own unique output what would happen when you call getname on the derived class object versus the bass class object what happens if a derived class has a pure virtual speak function ie virtual speak const 0 and you call speak on an object of that derived class im just looking for some overall clarification because these examples go more in depth than the ones in the lecture exercises thanks so much
student,in the following picture if i substitute pbackptr for backptrp do they do the same thing thank you
student,dynamic type has nothing to do with dynamic memory right like you could have parent ptr child c or you could have parent ptr new child and in either scenario the static type is parent and he dynamic type is child am i thinking about that right
student,how do you know when to use for example iterator and listt iterator
student,i am a little confused on how this piece of code runs i understand what is going on until benderptr selfdestruct but i am not sure what happens after that if someone could explain the steps that would be great
student,line 2 in the problem fish fish new fish1 this line tries to make a dynamic fish with distance 1 and a pointer to it also of type fish why is this not allowed line 6 bluefishdistance this line derefences the pointer to a bluetang and then tries to access the member variable distance since distance is protected in the fish superclass shouldnt this be allowed
student,dory is a dory that is pointed to by a bluetang pointer when we call this pointers member functions the pointer would see that the bluetang member functions have not been declared virtual wouldnt that mean that the pointer dory cannot access any of its member functions which means that it is impossible to make the code display the provided messages
student,if you are given a listint l and want to iterate through the list pointed to by l does this work for listintiterator ilbegin i lend i
student,what if the catch statement type does not match the throw type and there is no default handler what happens what if there is a try statement with no catch i know that a derived class will be caught by its parent class type like f2014 1h why is that though is there some sort of implicit upcast to check the compatibility of the throw type and the catch type does this only work for instances of the class or would it do this for pointers as well for example what would the output of this code be class cheese class swiss public cheese int main swiss s new swiss try throw s catch cheese c cout caught a pointer to a cheese catch swiss s cout caught a pointer to a swiss
student,what are private member variables initialized to if the default constructor is used is it 0 or undefined
student,would this line of code from 3a be valid or invalid i believe in the exam review it was said this is valid but i may be mistaken 7 bluefish­numfishesconsumedfishesaround 1 all of the arguments are valid and it calls a proper member function but numfishesconsumed returns an int can you call a nonvoid function in this manner and basically ignore the return value thanks
student,if a constructor requires that its input be nonzero how should you account for this in the code for the constructor
student,if you have g pointing to zoofront and then you pop front isnt g then pointing to nothing so when youre deleting g it shouldnt work im just having trouble picturing these happening as a pointer thanks
student,what is a polymorphic container and what is the difference between a polymorphic container and a templated container
student,why does it just do caught animal if we crossed out that first catch statement would it catch alpaca then does it just do the first one that works
student,i just wanted to verify what i understand about these kinds of list such as the gorilla from lecture when you need to deallocate the gorilla variables this must be done in main correct the listh is not responsible for this because it only deletes the nodes not what they represent
student,what would be the static and dynamic type for the ptr shape ptr triangle triangle ptr triangle thanks
student,i know this should be basic stuff but i am all confused about arrays first is my understanding of array declaration correct if not could someone please clarifygive me hard and fast rules for the different usages a int arraysome int value only used if the array is know at compile time and stored on the stack b int array besides initializing a pointer only used for dynamic arrays second what is an array under the hood i know that array points to the address of the first element in the array however i am wondering how this would look in memory a int array12 would this create a pointer on the stack that points to the first of the 12 values which would also be stored on the stack b new int3 similarly is this just three dynamic ints on the heap or does it also make some sort of default pointer on the heap that points to the first of the three ints third for a lot of the classes we did as examples in lecture we declared a private member variable that was a pointer to a dynamically allocated array however the private member variable was defined in the declared in the implementation as int ptr wouldnt this be indistinguishable from just a pointer to an int plz help
student,from question 3b i have a few questions of my own to clarify if we have fish dory new dory5 then i assume the base class is fish and the static type is fish if we have bluetang dory new dory5 then i know the static type is bluetang but is the base type still fish if we had fish dory new dory5 then when you do dorycolor would you get this message this fish is red
student,i have a question about iterating through for loops in the example below i get a compile error because of the following error listtiterator with t int cannot be defined in the current scope basically i dont understand why i cant initialize two iterators in this for loop is there something wrong with the syntax
student,can we destruct an instance of the child class with the destructor called from its parent class like when the destructor is not virtual if we can why does this work there maybe some new members in the child class
student,the catch statement is this catch animal b code here why does the statement catch a type animal instead of just an animal why isnt it catch animal b code here thanks
student,can somebody explain this step by step i keep getting the wrong output thank you
student,when doryname is called is this question the desired output is hello im a blue tang hello my name is dory if a function is virtual i know that the dynamic type is used dory in this case if not the static types bluetang function is used and if its a constructor they run from the base down whats confusing me here is how both bluetang and dorys name functions run for this one line of code why is this name is virtual so only dorys should run as it is the dynamic type or are we just supposed to cout hello im a blue tang in dorys own name function
student,could you pass a function pointer into a prototype that is set up to accept functors for example could you pass a function pointer into template typename predicate bool anyofpredicate pred
student,should we initialize the variables mult and count to 0 in their declaration in the private section of this class i thought that initializing variables upon declaration is best practice but earlier in this practice exam i have seen member variables not initialized so i just want to make sure i know what to do to avoid getting points taken off
student,a question about 3c in spring a new copy constructor with a twist it says we may call insertback and fn but we cant call any other functions however are we allowed to call sourcebegin and sourceend functions or have some iterator here otherwise it seems that we have no way to get the datum inside the nodes of source list
student,can a list function access the private variables of a separate list as the input for example in this specific problem can we access sourcefirst
student,ive read this thread httpspiazzacomclassi3t4azliemrxbcid3452 and im still not totally clear
student,just want to confirm there will be oh at the scheduled times tomorrow in 1695 bbb
student,im assuming that since delete is never called the destructors for bender and robot are never invoked is this correct
student,is it possible that we could have an estimate of the grading scale for this semester if not can you provide the scale from a past semester the information would be useful when calculating potential grades thanks
student,for a b c d lets assume a is the base class i understand that if a is virtual then b c d will be virtual too if a is not virtual and b is virtual will c and d be virtual i run this through xcode it seems like b c and d do not inherit virtual can someone explain why this happen
student,do you just loop through the mosterarmy using an iterator and call delete on the dereferenced value of the iterator thanks
student,must iterators always be templated im assuming not since you can make a container that only holds one data type and its iterator wouldnt need to be templated can someone confirm thanks
student,during the lecture on memory models some of the stack and heap problems asked how much memory is leaked will we need to know specifically how much memory is leaked given code or do we only need to be able to recognize which variables were leaked if we do need to know how much what does sizeofint mean
student,can you use a parent class private member function in a derived class public member function and if so is this code how you would do it example class parent private int secretfun int n class child public parent public bool newfun int x parent secretfun 12 return x
student,does anyone want to study together i am going through the practice exams and i think it would be helpful to get a few heads on it i am in the ugli respond if you are interested thanks
student,why is bluefishcolor lead to calling the fish definition of color it is of type fish but its a bluetang so shouldnt it implicitly cast as a bluetang and therefore call the bluetang definition of color also i couldnt compile the code on my computer
student,i have a question about derived classes and virtual functions and i will ask the question in regards to 2 situations 1 class fxx public fxx cout fxx default ctor endl void channel 0 virtual void phrase cout fearless endl class archer public fxx int shotstaken public archerint glengooleblue shotstakenglengooleblue virtual void phrase cout phrasing boom endl if i make an archer by archer sterling new archer10 and then attempt to call sterlingphrase which of the two phrases will output fearless or phrasing boom 2 given the above two classes adding on class lana public archer public lana cout lana default ctor endl virtual void phrase 0 class aj public lana int diapers public ajint diapersin diapersdiapersin virtual void phrase cout goo endl in a similar sense if i make an aj aj new aj5 and then call ajphrase what will print out if i have been asking these questions right and you see where im going im trying to find out how far you go up towards the base class through virtual functions until you reach a class where that function is a pure virtual like in lanas or until the class is pure virtual like in fxx i apologize if i have forgotten little things in my code and hope that you see past into the underlying question thank you
student,lesson 14 states that polymorphic objects need virtual destructors i assume this is what causes destructors to be called bottomup however in the definition of the fish and bluetang class neither of the destructors are labeled as virtual the sample output on page 14 also seems to imply that the destructors are called bottomup is there a virtual tag missing in fishs destructor or am i misunderstanding something here
student,a friend and i are disagreeing over what is leaked i thought it was 56 could someone explain their logic in this problem
student,when writing code for an inherited class as in both practice exams when do you write code using the scope resolution operator in virtual functions for example in spring 2014 4 virtual void killhumans cout hkquery endl killerrobot killhumans please help explain what this line does
student,how exactly is one supposed to use declare the agentcomp predicate to be used in the sortagents function closeragent closerplayer agentcomp ac sortagentszombiesac sortagentswerewolvesac listagent monsters mergeagentszombies werewolves closer is what i did correct
student,say i have the following code int factorialint n if n 0 throw n does factorial function int main int x cin x try cout factorialx endl catch cout error endl if the user entered in a positive acceptable number for x then error would not print correct the catch all is confusing me thanks
student,i know that when you create a subclass that only uses variables its parent class also you you use an initializer list for example since the isosceles class still has 3 side lengths like triangle its constructor looks like isoscelesdouble base double leg trianglebase leg leg however i was wondering what should be done if isosceles had new private variables not found in triangle along with the sides are you supposed to define these in the braces after the initializer list
student,is a derived class considered to be a subtype of its parent class if it does not add more operations but satisfies the first rwo rules thanks a lot
student,i wanted to test my understanding of polymorphism so i coded an example of two classes a b class a public a cout a constructor endl virtual a cout a destructor endl virtual void donothing cout a method ran endl class b public a omitted for brevity same thing as a with print statements for b now in my main a aptr new b when i ran it the destructors would not print out but i i did b b they would really confusedwhy does this happen also didnt understand this in 2014 spring 4a
student,the presumed strategy for this question is to create a pointer to a new empty monsterarmy then iterate through the monsterarray pointed to by other and add each element in the other monsterarray to the new empty monsterarray in reverse order but how are we supposed to iterate backwards through the other monsterarray if we do not have an overloaded prefix decrement or any mechanism linking the pointedto monsters
student,if you had this class base protected int xy public functions class derived1public base protected int a b public functions class derived2 public derived1 protected int d e public functions would the class derived2 be able to access all the ints d e a b x y or just d e a and b thanks
student,why does the value pointed to by z change within the scope of main and not just within the scope of foo since pointers are pass by value i would have expected that when z is passed into foo the value pointed to by z will not change however the value does change from 56 to 12
student,i just had a quick question about child and parent class member function calling specifically relating to the spring 4b question 1 so the killerrobot has a member variable numhumanskilled does every object of hkprotocoldroid have a numhumanskilled however it just cant access it through its member functions it has to access it through the member functions of the killerrobot 2 i know if a child class is overriding a parent class function in order to call the parent function you use the operator however say a child class doesnt override a parent member function but it wants to call it inside its own member function so for example in hkprotocoldroidreport you want to call killerrobotgetnumhumanskilled do you need the killerrobot thanks
student,why do we need a constructor for the class hkprotocoldroid what does it delete
student,for some reason although i am officially signed up for and have always attended the 9001030am mw section of eecs 280 with professor fu ctools wants me to evaluate borromeo instead i dont think i should evaluate the wrong person so i assume this is some sort of error any suggestions
student,can someone explain why we need to use templates when using functors ive watched that portion of lecture more than once and cannot wrap my head around it for some reason thanks
student,does anyone know the email address we email to show we completed our course evaluations for extra credit
student,1 whats the difference between subtypes and subclass on the lecture slide lec11 slide 48 a prototype is a subtype if it fulfills the substitution principle is it the determinant criterion for a subtype then what are the criteria for a subclass 2 what makes liskov substitution principle special comparing to c inheritance thanks
student,i remember that using 0 is better for c style from lecture but our intention is much more clear with null are we allowed to use null on the exam or should we just stick to 0
student,can you execute delete on a pointer that is set to zero please explain thanks
student,when creating a new monsterarmy do you need the parentheses in the line monsterarmy copy monsterarmy or can you just have monsterarmy copy monsterarmy
student,im really confused as to how to approach this without using any of lists member functions could someone help to point me in the right direction
student,are we going to be given the list class on the exam
student,when you create a pointer to a dynamically allocated class object do you need to call the constructor with new i am referencing this line of code in the sp14 monster mash problem monsterarmy army new monsterarmy it seems logical that you would have to call the constructor to create a new object on the heap but i am just making sure that the following would not work monsterarmy army new monsterarmy
student,or is it just going to be the only two on the calendar at the moment
student,i know its been a while but i kept missing professor deorios office hours so i was wondering if we can still pick up our midterm before the final on thursday and from where we can pick it up
student,someone took my commented eecs 280 fall 2014 exam at vidals review session and left their exam photo included i would like to get my exam back so if the exam below is yours please respond to this message eecs280i8q0jjdsktm9jpeg
student,when must a representation invariant hold true from the review i have the answer as b when entering a member function and when leaving a member function why would b be preferable to a for the entire time that the code is running wouldnt it still be important for the representation invariant to hold true throughout runtime in case the user needs to use the invariant for a new member function
student,1 int const p so it means pointer cannot change what does it mean by that does it mean when we do array traversal the position of the pointer cannot change thanks
student,can a class have no default constructor and only the customized constructor
student,i simply cannot figure out how to do either of the questions in this problem as there is no private member data provided and we cannot use any member functions for the similar question on the fall exam i just exploited the linked list feature of the classes to traverse and modify but since there is no private member data for the monster or monsterarmy classes i have no clue how to do it are these linked lists whats a tip for completing the problem without knowing about the data and not being able to use the functions im at a total loss
student,do i just go to the office hour i didnt go to review session so i dont know answers to all of the problem will the gsis still check my answers
student,for the midterm review all of the released questions were put on labster for us to try out our solutions and to help us visualize the answers 1366 it was super helpful will this be done for the final released questions too thanks
student,are we allowed to use sizefront and back for 2a or do those count as lists member functions
student,in the sample output given for this problem there is a line that reads p sherman 42 wallaby way sydney this is presumably supposed to print when the dory class location member function is called but the inherited location function from the bluetang class returns a string and does not print out anything does this mean that we are supposed to implement location differently in the dory class so that it is a void function that prints something out
student,im obviously off to a bad start what is the purpose of the double asterisk in front of x
student,is our implementation of swap supposed to swap the first and last pointers as well as all the nodes in the list or just the pointers the description says that it needs to swap the values of the member variables and in the list class the only member variables seem to be first and last
student,this is caused by not catching any throw
student,they do same thing in a sense that copy constructor copies others variables to this and operator overloading customizes sign but it basically copies all the member variables and dynamic arrays from others to this which is same as what copy constructor does whats the difference between two
student,many of the labs i have turned in have not yet been graded i was just wondering if i was the only one or if the lab grading hasnt been done yet thanks
student,would someone like to share the answers to these questions i couldnt make it to the review and for 2e is the correct answer is no leak
student,hi does the one cheat sheet for final means only one sheet or only one sheet for after midterm and an additional sheet allowed which is directly the sheet used in midterm thanks
student,what does efficiently accepts as input an iterator mean
student,class random random virtual void name 0 i understand that in the main function we can only declare random r instead of random r because random is an abstract class my question is that what is going to happen if i remove 0 the pure virtual part of the class am am able to declare random r for example class random random virtual void name int main random r is this allowed thanks
student,props to whoever made the swkotor reference on the spring 14 exam if you have no clue what this means look up kotor hk47 made my day as a huge fan of the game
student,my partner and i had filed a regrade request for the hand graded portion of project 3 and have not yet received any response is this because our request was denied how can we find out more about the status of our request
student,do we get extra credit for completing the course evaluation
student,i was just going through old lectures and i was wondering why for lecture 21 iterators the member functions iterator begin and end were outside of the iterator class
student,so i had to leave vidals exam review right as we were discussing 3c and i missed the final answer i was getting the sense that it was either just b or a and b if anyone could tell me what was settled on that would be really great thanks in advance
student,but who is vidal
student,why is it necessary to check for selfassignment in the overloaded assignment operator implementation for lists
student,can we use assert in exams
student,prof deorio mentioned that there will be free food given away on monday what time and where is this free delicious free food
student,listagent mergeagents 1 is this function returns a list of agent 2 when we are writing codes should we assume that acagent agent will return true if the first agent is bigger than than the second but this would cause a problem when calling this function in 4c where the new list should be sorted in increasing order
student,how much about bigo do we need to know for the exam
student,in vidals review session he alluded to 3 benefits of abstract data types f14 exam question 1m the first two are encapsulation and information hiding after going through the adt lecture i am still uncertain about the the third one is it just general abstraction any insight is appreciated
student,i already noticed that grading statistics for project 4 were up so that makes me think that there may not be a styling portion to the grade or that will be posted and then the new grading statistics could be posted afterwards anyways im confused on how project 4 is graded is there styling and the same for project 5
student,when should we expect to get handgrading scores for project 4 and 5
student,will lab solutions be posted i wanted to use these to review for the final and think they would be very helpful
student,for any variable or object created even if it isnt a pointer or created with new is there still the variable name in the stack pointing to the object in the heap second question if the code is new int3 there is a 3 int in the heap but what would we label in the stack if it isnt given a variable name thanks
student,if there are multiple objects created in main what determines the order in which they are destroyed if not explicitly deleted thanks
student,hi my teammates and i received an email stating that our code was ungraded because it was not extractable however our last submission did compile properly and went through the preliminary autograder may i know how the final autograder can have such error thanks
student,global and local variables have space that is allocated for them at compile time while dynamic variables are allocated at run time what exactly does compile and run time mean
student,this is going out on a limb here because i know this course is pretty rigid with its procedures but is there any chance the staff could post a copy of the midterm we took midterm w 2015 online i just wanted to have a fresh copy so i could rework the problems to prepare for the final and then compare them to what i did in the past
student,if we dont have an overloaded operator how would we add the monsters backwards from the original army
student,sadly this semester i wasnt able to take eecs 203 due to classes i needed to take so i have to take it next semester im planning my schedule and i was wondering is it similar to this class in that which lecture you attend does not matter and you can attend any one thank you
student,in 22exceptionscpp posted on ctools i notice if n0 throw negativeerror which never explicitly creates a negativeerror instead they just throw negativeerror in factorial and catch negativeerror in main does it mean that the compiler automatically instantiates a negativeerror for us when the program runs if so will throw negativeerror still work if we have some private member variables in negativeerror eg private string errormessage thanks a lot
student,i went ahead and typed up the code for question 4a and i had expected the output to be this robot name ctor im back baby my self destruct sequence is 1a2b3c aw yea im bender my self destruct sequence is 1a2b3c expected but was surprised because it was actually this robot name ctor im back baby my self destruct sequence is 1a2b3c aw yea im bender boom actual why is it that the compiler chooses to run the selfdestruct function for robot and not the selfdestruct function for bender while the selfdestruct function is called on a robot shouldnt the pointer should still return a bender object when dereferenced and therefore shouldnt the selfdestruct function for the bender class run
student,c spits out error cannot convert person to const person in assignment when i try to do lastalpha findmaxpeople n a not sure whats happeningcan someone help me out
student,i am a little mixed up on the order in which the constructors and destructors run when it comes to inherited data types suppose that i have the following inheritance tree grandparentparentchild such that parent inherits from grandparent and child inherits from parent if i run the following code int main child a return 0 would the order in which the constructors execute be grandparent ctor parent ctor child ctor and then the order in which the destructors execute be child dtor parent dtor grandparent dtor or would the destructors execute in the same order as the constructors
student,how do you return a reference to the t that was removed if you create a local temp to store it before deleting it you end up returning a reference to a local variable which is incorrect thanks
student,i am confused about the constructor given in this class class killerrobot public robot public killerrobotconst string namein robotnamein true numhumanskilled0 virtual void killhumans numhumanskilled virtual void taunt 0 int getnumhumanskilled const return numhumanskilled private int numhumanskilled i am confused specifically about robotnamein true in the initializer list could someone explain what this does why are you able to construct a base class object in a subclass initializer list and what does this accomplish thanks
student,if one of the methods in the derived class has exit1 in the function body does the type not adhere to the liskov substitution principle because substituting an object of type s where an object of type t is expected and then calling that method will cause the program to crash is this considered changing the correctness of the original computation thanks
student,are we allowed to use the compare functions in our functors or do we have to make our own implementations of those functions
student,that app stumped that presented in class the other day is actually kind of cool i know a couple of us are on there already and i think it would be super helpful come exam time they also just said that they would bring you a pizza to your study spot if you invite three friends through the app and get them to download
student,is eecs 281 structured the same where i can sign up for a lecture but still go to any of the four the one that fits my schedule is closed and the others conflict with my other classes is lecture structured like 280
student,hello for lab 12 we were told to override the operator so we can call a functor like a function can someone give me a hint as to how to do this i cant seem to find it in the lecture slides thanks in advance
student,this has probably been asked before but we submitted to the autograder before our earlier submission had been tested naturally because everyone is submitting now which means that our newer better submission was refused even though it was before the deadline is there something that can be done about this
student,my partner and i just submitted but we see that there are some files in the queue from over an hour ago we are concerned that despite our submission an hour before the deadline that if the autograder doesnt reach our file by 1155pm we will not receive credit for the project can we get a little clarification on this grey area thank you
student,right now im failing rationaltest00 calctest00 and calctest01 all three of these work fine on caen ive also diffed this with a previous submission which got full points and verified that the only things that have changed between these are one indent change and one additional test case in a file im completely lost at the moment did the autograder change or do i just have a mega brain fart somewhere and also is there a guarantee that if i submit a targz that i previously submitted i would get 100 on this preliminary autograder because the content inside my files is pretty much the same aside from a test case file
student,do we
student,replace this returncode call test with this returncode callvalgrind test
student,hello my code is compiling on a linux terminal using the g compiler but is returning an error for calctest00cpp calctest01cpp and rationaltest00cpp please help
student,i know this has been discussed before but i still cannot figure it out my while condition in the calccpp is cin str str q however my program is still falling into an infinite loop in the output file what could be wrong with my code thanks
student,my list copy constructor is somehow managing to add an extra number to the end of the list thats passed into it which is const with seemingly no code that should actually be doing that and it seems to happen somewhat randomly do any of you know what could possibly be going on
student,hi guys theoretically negative 0 should be the same as positive 0 does c know theyre the same my calculator messes up when i put in 0 with a positive 0 1 0 and 239 0 correctly becomes 10 with a negative 0 123 0 incorrectly becomes 00
student,for the comparepersonname functor i currently have two private variables string p1 p2 and set those equal to agetname and bgetname however im not really sure how i can compare all five peoples names do i have to declare multiple instances of the class or is there a way to find the last person just by declaring one instance
student,im trying to call another function in stackh from my match function but i keep getting the compiler error reference to nonstatic member function must be called any ideas on how to fix this
student,our compilecheck is compiling and running fine but when we use valgrind it says that we have a memory leak in pushback when we test for memory leaks in the other list tests it doesnt give this memory leak
student,should calccpp treat double digit inputs as one number or two separate single digit numbers ie if 12 is entered should the stack be 12 or 2 1
student,hey everybody im wondering about how to call a copy constructor within a test im trying to debug but my code wont compile with the following listint anotherlist anotherlistmylist why is this whats going on
student,i create a class outside main but when i try to call countif in main i always got error message calccpp in function ‘int main’ calccpp73 error no matching function for call to ‘stackrationalcountifunresolved overloaded function type’ stackh62 note candidates are int stacktcountifpredicate const with predicate bool compareeqrational t rational do you guys know whats wrong with this method
student,im getting this output in valgrind is still reachable memory a problem ie is this considered a leakwill lose points on the project 16290 leak summary 16290 definitely lost 0 bytes in 0 blocks 16290 indirectly lost 0 bytes in 0 blocks 16290 possibly lost 0 bytes in 0 blocks 16290 still reachable 110109 bytes in 1362 blocks 16290 suppressed 0 bytes in 0 blocks
student,ive tried changing many things in my stackh as well as looking for any dependencies i may have used that could cause a compile time error but i cant find anything that could cause my stackh file not to compile i have run the default tests on the caen machines without a problem but it just doesnt go through on the autograder any ideas this also happens with one of my own test files
student,do we need to shut off the asserts we added in the code when we submit if we do how do you shut it off
student,any ideas why this would fail i dont see them being equal thanks
student,since the output function in stackh uses a template of type u but the template for the class itself is of type t should there be a template typename u on the line about the friend function declaration
student,if we have an iterator that points past the end of a list and we call insert on it should the datum be inserted at the end of the list the requires clause before this function states that the iterator must be associated with a list but doesnt specify that it has to be a valid iterator
student,i looked at someone elses valgrind error in one of their test cases but i didnt get a location specifically in my listtest07cpp from valgrind i deleted one suspicious test case and there was no more error but i dont see where the test case could go wrong is there a gsi who i can email my code to since office hours are pretty much over this is my error 3872 copyright c 20022012 and gnu gpld by julian seward et al 3872 using valgrind381 and libvex rerun with h for copyright info 3872 command listtest07 3872 empty list insert at beginning of list iterator empty list also erases just inserted element pass 0 1 list insert at beginning of list pass 1 0 1 list insert in middle of list tests erase on line 6263 instead of using pop to test iterator pass also tests erasing from middle of a list setting iter to end insert in back of list pass 3872 3872 heap summary 3872 in use at exit 24 bytes in 1 blocks 3872 total heap usage 110 allocs 109 frees 2640 bytes allocated 3872 3872 24 bytes in 1 blocks are definitely lost in loss record 1 of 1 3872 at 0x4a075fc operator newunsigned long vgreplacemallocc298 3872 by 0x400ded main in afsumicheduuseramamdedesktopproj5listtest07 3872 3872 leak summary 3872 definitely lost 24 bytes in 1 blocks 3872 indirectly lost 0 bytes in 0 blocks 3872 possibly lost 0 bytes in 0 blocks 3872 still reachable 0 bytes in 0 blocks 3872 suppressed 0 bytes in 0 blocks 3872 3872 for counts of detected and suppressed errors rerun with v 3872 error summary 1 errors from 1 contexts suppressed 6 from 6
student,hello all running calc using calctest00in works fine in visual studio and caen g but fails on the autograder more perplexing im getting an extra 1 output on the end each of just the last 6 lines of calctest01out using both visual studio and caen g it doesnt happen when using the vs debugger so i cant say if theyre coming from the bottom of the stack but think it unlikely they come from there in light of all of the clear functions at the end of that test sequence has anyone else encountered this dilemma would anyone have any ideas of what could be the culprit thanks in advance for any responses
student,so i tried the following code include iostream using namespace std class fish public virtual void name class bluetang public fish public virtual void name cout i am a blue tangn class dory public bluetang public virtual void name cout my name is doryn int main bluetang dory new dory doryname return 0 and it prints a single line my name is dory however 3bs output says does it mean that hello im a blue tang is produced by the name function in dory not bluetang thanks a lot
student,when testing my list file my code works fine as long as i use popfront in my code however when i use popback i get a segfault whenever i try to use my iterator my popback function is the same as popfront but sets victim to the last node and sets last to its previous node what could be the issue thanks in advance
student,when i try to insert an element into an empty list and then check the element by i i get a segfault can someone please provide an explanation thanks
student,is erase supposed to crash if the begin or end function is passed into it i mean for end it makes sense for the erase to abort if theres an assert checking if the iterators node is not null but why would it crash for begin im getting some kind of memory map every time i pass in begin into erase glibc detected listtest01 double free or corruption fasttop 0x0000000001bd4070 backtrace lib64libcso60x3063675e66 listtest010x400e5a lib64libcso6libcstartmain0xfd0x306361ed5d listtest010x4009c9 memory map
student,template typename u stdostream operatorstdostream os const stacku obj for typename listtiterator i objlistbegin return os im getting the errors use of undeclared identifier t and no type named iterator in namespace i thought adding typename to the front would identify t but it hasnt
student,hello do test cases with assert statements that return an incorrect value count against us or do they not count at all thanks
student,i know the spec says we dont need to do error checking but is 004 a valid number input also should be read in as both a plus and minus or simply bad input
student,im not sure how to go about this programmatically i know we can test our code in valgrind to make sure ours doesnt leak but if we were given a buggy solution on the autograder with memory leaks im not sure how to go about writing tests to catch them
student,will we get style points off if we have cstrings in our calccpp
student,so im going back and writing more test cases for my iterator to finalize everything and im just curious can you move a null pointer should i and i work on null pointers for example i do something like listint mylist listintiterator i mylistbegin this should point to null mylistinserti 5 assertmylistfront 5 should hold true however after my input now i am curious if i can move this iterator or do i have to reassign it in order to work with it again could i do i right now im getting segfaulr i same thing with this one
student,i know that when there is no private variable in heap we dont need to add destructor and copy constructor but here the problem comes in the public interface of class rational there is no copy constructor so we cant have such code rational r11 rational r2 r1 but i think this kind of code is quite cummon so i wonder if we need it
student,i dont understand how implementing these functions is possible when we dont have access to nodeptr since its a private member variable since all we can do is dereference the iterator how is it possible to manipulate the list
student,hello everybody im having trouble overloading the operator in stackh im just trying to do the same thing from rational for the most part os i return os but the compiler gives me this error followed by a bunch of gobbleygook stackh1208 error no match for ‘operator’ operand types are ‘stdostream aka stdbasicostreamchar’ and ‘listintiterator’ which seems to me like theres a problem sending an integer to the output which there shouldnt be also maybe my overloaded derefrence operator isnt working its speculation does anybody have an idea of what the problem might be here thanks in advance
student,hey everybody im having some seriously annoying compiler errors caused by the iterators syntax no matter what i cant figure out what type it wants when i declare the iterator can anybody tell me whats wrong with the following this iterator is in stackh in the stack class listtiterator i listfront i listback i im also having trouble using it for the overload because i just cant figure out how to declare it please help
student,it says that input will always be valid does that mean i can assume that they wont try to print when there are no operands in the stack
student,i know this question has been asked for many many times but i just want to have a final double check can professor answer this question the reason why i ask this question is that i dont know if i can say this in my test case listint l here l is empty listintiterator it lend here the its nodeptr points to the null linsertit1
student,the rme for stack says note since a reference is returned potentially the caller can use the call to change the top without doing a poppush you should test for that in your tests eg topspushitem results in a reference to item so if this code is run is the commented output correct stackint s spush3 stop stop 2 cout s output should be 6
student,hello i accidentally entered a project submit into the autograder with an infinite while loop in calccpp how can i get this out of the queue its been running for the past 22 minutes thanks
student,im trying to fix a bug in stackh but when i switch the compiler flags from o1 to g it causes a bunch of compiler errors has anyone seen this beforeknow how to fix it
student,is there any other type that will be passed into calculator other than int like negative int
student,im almost finished testing for calc and in order to be thorough myself and my partner wrote up a bunch of calculator operations and their predicted outputs by hand the calc works exactly as expected until we get to the last line of our input c 1 0 1 0 a this is supposed to output 00 and it does but not until i press enter on the keyboard the calc just waits on standby until i do none of our other input required the enter key to output the right answer the calc usually just spit out the output automatically does anyone have any idea why this is going on if its even a problem or how i could fix it
student,hi we are getting this error and cant figure out why and even the gsi in oh said to post to piazza since he had no clue what was causing it but we suspect that it is something in our list insert function please help thanks
student,somehow my program cannot read or so input 2 3 a will give me 3 2 while input 2 3 a will give me 6 i tried to read the operator into a string as well as into a char and both didnt work anyone experienced the same thing
student,suppose the big three are not required for a particular class but we include it anyways would points be taken off
student,will vidal be holding a final review session similar to the one for the midterm if so when will that be
student,i wrote a functor called countelements to work with my countif function however im still a little confused where to define countelements do i put it in stackh or stacktest00cpp i also wrote a functor in calccpp and put it before my main function is this correct
student,im getting an error that iterator was not declared in the scope when im trying to write the stackh function countif and the os stream one as well i tried all options of declaring this a friend class of that etc etc help
student,one of our listtest files arent compiling on the autograder but it works fine when i run it myself on caen could adding comments in listh file cause the autograder to freak out and scream
student,
student,hello im having an issue where my copy constructor has a segmentation fault when im adding nodes to the list using either pushfront or pushback the puzzling part is if i go through node pointers from the beginning of the copied list to the end using pushback i get segfaults if i use pushfront i get no segfaults but i do get a backwards list im very confused help would be appreciated thanks in advance
student,when i run calc calctest00in calctest00out and calc calctest01in calctest01out everything runs smoothly until i get to the last command in the in file somehow my program runs on infinite loop and continously prints out the last rational number on a newline in my out file i feel like this is due to the fact that the in file does not have a q at the end of the list of commands what should i do to solve this problem
student,for example using the logic in spec for 10 10 gives 00 but this special case is not mentioned in the spec also since we are not supposed to modify rationalh how are we supposed to declare the big three functions
student,so apparently after using the namespace unique method for storing a functor definition outside of the main function in calccpp i get this error saying that the functor in main presumably that was not declared in this scope what should i do wall werror pedantic o1 calccpp rationalcpp o calc calccpp in function ‘int main’ calccpp101 error ‘matcheck’ was not declared in this scope make calc error 1
student,my code segfaults when a destructor is called on an empty list after several items have been added to the list using the stack interface and then popped off the list specifically it segfaults at the very end of popall function right before it returns to the list destructor what could be causing this is it most likely a problem with pushfront or popfront
student,so i submitted to the autograder and i think its stuck in an infinite loop because its been running for an hour now and im not quite sure what to do
student,just one last check to make sure im not forgetting something when we call listeraseiterator the iterator we use should be invalidated correct ie if we tried listeraseiter listeraseiter we should get an error correct we dont want to set the iterator to either the previous or next node right
student,hello i am having a problem running make mytests for list i have compiled and ran each of my tests individually with g wall werror pedantic listh listtestxx o test test each test executes properly however when i run make mytests the console prints pass from listtest00 and then just freezes i have tried reextracting the makefile but dont really know what else to do to fix this thank you in advance
student,friends coders countrymen lend me your ears i come to bury bugs not to praise them you can do it you can beat the last project
student,do we need to check if the stack size is big enough to do each command
student,hi all visual studio is telling me theres a mismatch between my declaration and definition can anyone see what im doing wrong declaration template typename predicate int countifpredicate pred const start of definition template typename predicate int stackpredicatecountifpredicate pred const thanks
student,why
student,im not sure whats causing this error
student,the compiler is saying bad access when it calls the overloaded operator i ran it through the debugger and says that there is an error with division 00 but in the test case neither the numerator or denominator inputted equals 0 is this an error with my constructor where i defined the invariants
student,wondering how submits work for this project do we get unlimited submits per day with feedback unlimited submits per day 2 with feedback or 2 submits per day and thats it by feedback i mean the little note that says that we got xxyy points with which ones compiled
student,if in the calculator a or p is called but there is nothing in the stack do we print nothing or are we supposed to print check if the stack is empty before printing
student,running calc on my computer works perfectly went to compile on caen and it compiles but when i run the test it doesnt print anything please help thank you in advancecurrently panicking a little bit
student,any suggestions we havnt modified anything we are not supposed to we compiled just fine on caen and have written quite a few test cases for list we are not couting anything or using namespace std not really sure what else it could be thanks
student,when i run calccpp with include rationalh i get an undefined reference to rational class member functions when using them in main of calccpp however if i have include rationalcpp things seem to work fine does anyone know if this needs to be fixed and if so how should i go about solving the problem
student,the stackh code says to not modify the classs public interface or private variables but i assume it is okay to add a friend function declaration to the stack class it has been mentioned in previous piazza posts that we should do this but i just want to make sure
student,when i try to do the assignment firstprev 0 the program segfaults i ran it with valgrind and it said this invalid write of size 8 at 0x100000cc9 listintpopfront listh304 by 0x10000098b main listtest00cpp21 address 0x8 is not stackd mallocd or recently freed i think it has something to do with the size of 0 and the size of a pointer but im really lost any advice
student,i am having a similar problem as 3213 i was testing my copyall function and realized it was going into an infinite loop because of my function call inside the for loop i have been trying for the past hour to fix this problem but cant come up with any solutions if someone could guide me in the right direction that would be greatly appreciated
student,are we and if so how
student,when i try and run stacktest00cpp it gives me different outputs in caen sometimes it segfaults other times it runs the entire program without a problem
student,when i try to output my top rational on my stack p the output i get is strange 858993460858993460 however when i print out the stack itself everything appears correctly including the top rational i am confused because my assumption would be that there is something wrong with the rational output function but it works with i choose to print all the random numbers that appear are from this function as there is the between a numerator and denominator this problem even occurred after an input of 2 p where should i look to figure out the source of this problem thanks for the help in advance
student,how are we supposed to get input for our calculator are we reading in from a file if so how do we get the name of the file to create the filestream can someone please explain this
student,in stackh can we add a constructor and make a copy function confused by the notice do not modify the classs public interface or private variables sorry if its a dumb question
student,hey guys visual studio is giving me a whole ton of errors when i include rationalh and i have no idea why does anyone know why these are happening i know for sure thats whats causing them commenting out that include line allows the program to run
student,someone who is smarter than me said that i needed to implement function t operator const for project 5 this is a ridiculous question but we dont need to implement it right
student,how many submissions do we get per day sorry if i missed an email or something thanks
student,can we use the destructor to remove everythingclear function in calccpp or is it a bad idea
student,stacktest00 is the same for the autograder and the test case we are given right ours is passing on caen but we get 01 for the autograder weve made sure that we are testing with the correct file relatively can someone confirm that the output for an empty stack is just a newline it says so for calc in the spec but we just want to make sure its the same for stack
student,when i run test cases for listtests i always get a segmentation fault after it shows pass did anyone experience the same problem i think there might be something wrong with my pushfront and pushback
student,i have while ss numbers calcpushrational numbers ssclear ss op where op is a string and ss is a string stream but every time i try to read in a or the op
student,when im reading in the input i have an issue because the operators are not of type char what type should these be i tried strings of just length one but nothing is stored
student,so im trying to insert 11 into my list but when i cout the elements using a for loop 11 is nowhere to be found am i calling insert the wrong way
student,a little question about functor which is passed as a argument into a template function because previously when we use template we always add type to make the compiler know what type we want to use but when functor is passed as an argument i didnt see any where use type does it means that when i pass functor into a function the compiler can automatically get the type of the functor for example greatern and substitute in into function
student,i asked this earlier but thought more people would see it now in my auto grade results im getting 2 pts off for listtest01 does this mean my listtest01cpp isnt passing in the autograder it is passing in my computer i compiled and tested in both in mac and caen linux
student,we can either implement functions below the header file or inside the class right thanks
student,could a gsi please take our submit off the queue we think we had an infinite loop that weve now fixed the submit is under adamsei
student,are we allowed to use isdigit in our calccpp
student,when compiling on g i receive the following error messages stackh79 error expected before i stackh79 error i was not declared in this scope where i is my iterator can you explain what could be causing this issue
student,i know supermemberfunc wont work since its java after googling that i think parentmemberfunc is the solution right thank you very much
student,when i am testing to see if my default rational constructor rational rwith the follwing include rationalh include iostream using namespace std int main rational z cout results for z z endl return 0 i get this compilation error cc1plus warnings being treated as errors rationaltest04cpp in function ‘int main’ rationaltest04cpp7 error the address of ‘rational z’ will always evaluate as ‘true’ make rationaltest04 error 1 what am i doing
student,so i started off a while loop with cineofnot sure if this covers ctld or ctlz but when i did ctld in g i got a segfaultcould anyone point me in the right direction if im not doing this right
student,how do we read in the calcin file in g and route it to a calcout file
student,are we required to write rmes for big three functions we wrote there are no rmes for the published cpp from lecture thanks
student,
student,ive noticed a lot of posts saying that you dont have to worry about the nodeptr because the iterator becomes invalidated after you call insert i call pushfrontback for edge cases which both affect firstlast however what are you supposed to do when you are inserting into the middle of a list nodeptr is supposedly not updatedoesnt matter and you arent dealing with first or last because youre in the middle of the list given this how do you actually insert the element i tried changing where nodeptrnext and prev point to but that isnt helping me actually translate it back into the original list since im modifying the nodeptr not firstlast any help would be appreciated
student,when trying to compile stacktest00 i am receiving the following error stacktest00cpp60 error sstacktcountif with predicate bool int t intcomparewith2 cannot be used as a function i have no idea what is causing this or what this is saying any help is appreciated
student,
student,can we use these in p5
student,when testing the function with a stack with only one element our code works fine if that element is a while number however when it is a fraction we keep getting segmentation fault any ideas where we might have gone wrong been looking at this bug for hours
student,do we need to include a overload operator for in list for iterators
student,do we need to implement a separate function for the check invariants in rational or can we just check the invariants by adding separate assert conditions we are not sure how to create a checkinvariant function since no function in the h file is declared for it
student,i submitted my files to the autograder and its telling me that one of my cpp files and neither of the calc tests compile correctly ive tested my code on caen and it compiles and runs fine is there a special way the calctest0xin files are being piped in that i could test to see if something is compiling incorrectly thanks
student,im wondering what should be replaced in the stack in these cases a 10 01 b 10 00 c 10 10 d 10 10 e 00 00
student,im attempting to recode my iterator end function to work with insert and from my understanding i need to make the pointer to past the end be pointing to null but with a connection to the previous node i figured in end i need to return an iterator to lastsnextnode but this is bad access and now im stuck
student,im finishing up test cases and im struggling to figure out how to verify that end produces an iterator pointing to a null pointer because we cant dereference something thats null i cant use the operator and i cant do assertiteratorname null for some reason bc a private constructor is being called should i just assume it works and not worry about writing an autograder test case for this or am i missing a potential testing option
student,can we add a function in class list that allows us to print out each element
student,in the specs it is stated what we need to use the command calc to run the program but when i run that command it does not work but i tried calc and it works may i know the difference between the previous is suggested rather than the latter thanks
student,when we submitted it says test case calctest00 failed to compile and test case calctest01 failed to compile but it compiles and works on caen terminal cant think of what were missing
student,the first input of calc was given may i know how to insert them when i run the program and find out how to check them using diff or do we need to input them ourselves moreover is there an input for output 01
student,i am having some severe issues with the autograder for calctests because my program keeps failing to compile on the autograder i went back to the absolute basic calccpp include stackh include rationalh include iostream include string include cstdlib include cassert include cmath int main return 0 this obviously compiled now the weird part i added these three simple lines of code string input cin input cout input inbetween main and return 0 now the autograder is back to not compiling why could these three lines cause the autograder to not compile it shouldnt be a file dependency issue i would think because it compiles in the first version fine
student,my reading of the rme clause of front and back and the prototype makes me think that i should be returning a reference to the t stored in the datum member variable of the node however in listtest00cpp the simple test case we were given in the starter pack there is a statement assertmylistfront 1 which means that it returns a t not an address of a t what am i missing
student,after reading all posts about this i am still confused about how to get input i understand you have to use cin but how do you know how many things people are entering couldnt you enter 100 characters if you wanted that being said how do you store all of these into intschars so that they can be used for the calculator or will cin only read in 1 numberletter at a time because where is whitespace between them any hintsguidance would be appreciated as i am totally lost on how to do this
student,according to the spec 2233 results in an undefined value ie 00 is this saying 23 23 00 because according to the ad bcbd formula the expression 23 23 would result as 09 which simplify via invariant to 01 if that is not what it is saying could you please give me an example of what the spec is referring to thank you
student,if negative zero is the in the denominator of a rational number should we just disregard the negative sign or should we say the number is negative for example should 170 simplify to 10 or 10 likewise should 170 simplify to 10 or 10 thanks for the help
student,spec for match you are not allowed to actually pop all the elements off the stack to implement thisyou can only pop the top value is the staff saying we arent allowed to do this or are they saying it is difficultimpossible to implement currently its pretty easy to just copy the stack pop those then push occurrences back to original stackunless we cant do this
student,when printing a stack before the newline and after the last element are we allowedshould we put a space so either last newline or last newline denotes a space
student,the spec says we will never test your code with inputs where the results overflow or even where the intermediate results in adding multiplying etc overflow but we will test for the above type of situation where the overflow is an artifact of your implementation does this mean we dont have to worry about getting passed rationals that naturally will create really large denominators ex 12 275 275 275 275 will result in an increasingly large denominator even with simplifying
student,why in duplicate does the spec say pop the first then push 2 copies wouldnt it be fastermore efficient to just use top and then push top would we lose points for doing this compared to the specs specification
student,do we have to template our functor for calccpp right now my partner and i have it such that the member variable of our functor class is a rational is our calculator going to be tested on input that is not specifically a rational number that we created ie doubles ints etc
student,in my listtest main when i set listintiterator i listbegin i get the following error text0xee undefined reference to listiteratoriteratorlistnode if i put typename in front of listintiterator i the error tells me that im using typename outside of the template ive kept begin in the listh the same as in the start file and the constructor is the same as the constructor from lecture so im not sure what the problem here is
student,when i try to walk the list id usually do something like node walkthelist firstand id do something like while walkthelist 0 walkthelist walkthelistnext valgrind spits back at me this conditional jump or move depends on uninitialized valueseven though im setting up a variable to use for going through the linked list100 sure im initializing this new node by setting it equal to firstsonot sure what is going on
student,after going through piazza 3135 about the end iterator and its behavior when called by insert im thinking about adding a dummy node as a private member in a list it has no defined datum its prev points to the last node in the list and its next points to 0 undefined this method has worked out for me after i updated the implementations of some of the other functions correspondingly but im wondering are we allowed to add a private member to the list interface at all i could also alternatively create a dynamic node every time end is called and set its prev to the last node in the list but taking care of the memory leak in this case could be annoying
student,will we only be graded on test cases for list are stack and rational tests not graded
student,are the same libraries allowed in calccpp allowed in our test cases include iostream include string include cstdlib include cassert include cmath thanks
student,for isosceles why is it that we get memory space for the triangle member variables but we cant access them
student,for the rpn calculator can we assume that the user will enter valid input ie doesnt enter f as input doesnt call until there are at least two numbers on the stack thanks
student,the first line of code creates a new bender so the default ctor of its parent runs before the default ctor of bendet runs right or does the compiler first look at bender ctor i notice that robot does not have a default ctor all it has is a name ctor and custom ctor so i think it wont compile because the compiler wont create a default ctor automatically right however if the first thing that the compiler does is look at bender ctor then everything makes sense because bender ctor calls the already existing robot name ctor thanks a lot
student,i would like to write tests to check that the list works identically with integers and rationals but rationalcpp and rationalh are not included in the makefile compile list
student,my listtest01cpp compiles and passes on caen but for some reason when i put it in the auto grader i get 02 fir listtest01 does anyone know why this would be happening
student,shouldnt these functions have regular dot operators instead of the arrow ie return agetage bgetage instead of return agetage bgetage
student,hello everyone i dont know how to solve my problem this is my second submission to autograder and it takes forever for my submit to go through the autograder same problem happened to my first submission may i know what the potential problems are please thanks for helping
student,i first do make calc no problem then i typecalc terminal says calccommand not found
student,for some reason none of our rational or stack test files are showing up on the list of student test files on the autograder summary does this mean they were not received
student,i know that were not supposed to change the public interface for list but is adding the big three as public ok similarly i know were not supposed to change the private section for stack but can we declare the operator as a friend here
student,the greatest common factor will always be positive correct
student,i was doing the fall 2014 exam and problem 2 brings in the concept of the copyswap idiom i was quickly confused were students taught this last semester or was it a new concept brought up in the middle of the exam and what exactly is the copy swap idiom
student,in the list function when we create a new instance of node are the pointers to next and prev automatically set to null or do we have to explicitly set them

student,when stack goes out of scope in the main function in calccpp does the list destructor run automatically i was under the assumption that destructors for dynamic variables only run when explicitly called with delete however my program isnt leaking memory when stack goes out of scope for some reason and i am not using a destructor for stack
student,would someone mind explaining just how we improved the efficiency of the intset slash what the importance of it is other then youll need this in 281 slash is this a relevant topic for exam slash is this going to be on the exam thank you
student,i have done everything here suggested on piazza i have compiled successfully on caen i am not using stoi and i have not changed any of the files we were told not to modify what could be going wrong
student,were trying to write countif right now and we have our for loop with the iterator declared such that the iterator starts pointing to the beginning of the list variable of the stack but for whatever reason our code wont build because begin is not a member of listt does anybody know why this is happening
student,the image above is the output we get when running the input file below long story short the second third and fourth time we call printall an extra zero is printed between the two lines of code in the stack any ideas as to why this could be happening
student,were struggling with the printall function in our calccpp file weve been trying to use an iterator to access each element in the stack but we keep getting flagged with an error for trying to assign a rational value to an iterator are we supposed to be using an iterator in this function and if so any tips as to how to remedy our problem thanks in advance
student,for the print all operator are we allowed to remove all the items from the stack and add them to a different stack in order to print them out and then put them back in the original stack does this count as leaving the stack unchanged as long as the final result is the same as before
student,the effects clause does not describe what the function performs or i may be mistaken either way i am very confused and could use some guidance here because it seems contradictory to me i have the logic all written out in comments with references to my initial searches code from lab12 effects returns true if name of a is ordered after the name of b alphabetically false otherwise bool comparepersonnameconst person a const person b return agetnamecomparebgetname 0 if agetnamecomparebgetname 0 returns true or a is aftergreater than b following the rules below then 1st character that does not match is greater in the compared string ie the compared string b is greater by the ascii which means one of the two is incorrect captials are lower than lower case a is lower than z reference asciitablecom compares the value of the string object or a substring to the sequence of characters specified by its arguments the compared string is the value of the string object string string1 string2 string1comparestring2 result lister below 0 they compare equal 0 either the value of the first character that does not match is lower prior in the compared string or all compared characters match but the compared string is shorter 0 either the value of the first character that does not match is greater after in the compared string or all compared characters match but the compared string is longer reference cpluspluscomreferencestringstringcompare
student,i have a really basic question in the project5pdf there is a table showing rational r12 rational r24 rational r21 and also rational r we can define a rational number by rational r12 but we cant do rational r right we can only define it by rational r
student,other than include the file do we have to do anything with it
student,hello i am encountering a vim problem i am wondering how i am supposed to solve it thanks in advance
student,hi i was wondering what the best form is for checking for null pointers like in a for loop if i had a char str should i use while str 0 str 0 str 0 etc
student,are we going to be given test cases where the required clause is not followed for example will we be given an empty list to perform erasepopbackfront on
student,so in one of my push functions im assigning first to a pointer temp the assignment is fine temp is not null afterwards it has the right value but when i try to delete temp i get pointer being freed was not allocated whats going wrong
student,when i run it in caen i got a seg fault yet when i run it in my ide i dont get a seg fault and everything works in my ide i have all of the same flags on as when i compiled it in caensoim not sure whats going on
student,so my partner and i originally were using stoi to convert our strings to integers for calccpp but then noticed that stoi is only included in c11 which caused our calccpp to not compile on caen we then decided to convert the input to a cstring instead and call atoi on it this compiles on caen but when we submit to the autograder it takes forever we submitted about a half hour ago and our file is still running any suggestions
student,as of now when inserting into a random part of the listnot the beginning or the end my code works in terms of i but doesnt translate this new corrected list back to the firstlast lists when the function is complete and it goes back to main does anyone know why it works in terms of i but then doesnt work when it goes out of inserts scope i think i am missing a line but not really sure what it should say since when inserting into the middle of the list first and last are not affected hopefully that made sense and any help would be appreciated
student,valgrind tells me i have no memory leaks but tells me ive got 6 errors in different contexts since were only being graded on memory leaks i shouldnt worry about the errors right
student,whenever i try to call an iterator in my stackh file i receive this error message error missing typename prior to dependent type name listtiterator can anyone explain what exactly this means and provide any insight as to what could be the cause of the problem thank you in advance
student,are the operators responsible for checking to make sure that after they do their thing that the number is reducedvalid for example if lhs 83 and rhs 23 then using the minus operator the result should be 63 2 should 2 or 63 be returned
student,what files do we have to test valgrind on it only worked for our listtests
student,are we allowed to use stoi for calccpp our code compiles but it gives us an error on caen
student,for the countif function in stackh are we supposed to use an iterator if so what should its type be
student,hello when i try testing stackh and pushing the int 0 onto the stack i get an error telling me the pushfront function doesnt take 0 arguments is this okay should 0s not be pushed onto the stack or what should i do to fix this thanks
student,if the user enters a negative denominator should we accept the input and then store it using a positive denominator and the opposite sign of the entered numerator or just not accept the input at all or not worry about it
student,is it bad style good style or convention to write 1 line bodied if statements all in one line ie if x 10 return x2 or should it be if x 10 return x2 or if x 10 return x2
student,should infinityinfinity 1 or 0
student,weve diffchecked our output with the correct output for both public test cases calctest00 calctest01 and found no differences yet when we submit to the autograder were still getting 01 for the calctest01 it provided no feedback other than that is this a possible problem with the autograder
student,should 00 01 00 or 01 should 00 10 00 or 01
student,is there a specific way to go about erasing the last element without continually popping back or specifically calling to erase when the iterator hits the value that is in the last spot erasing the last element would change where last points to except end points past the end so you cant use that to determine if the iterator is pointing to the last element in the list any help would be appreciated
student,since the spec say we wont be given numbers that automatically overflow ints does that mean the biggest number we could receive is 2147483647
student,i traced an error in my code back from stacktest00cpp to an infinite loop in my copyall function but im not sure whats causing the infinite loop this is what my copyall code looks like pretty sure its all implemented correctly template typename t void listtcopyallconst listt l stdcout made it into copy allnlfirst lfirst tand lfirstnext lfirstnext n for node ptr lfirst ptr 0 ptr ptrnext stdcout made it into for looptptr ptr tand ptrnext ptrnext tptrdatum ptrdatum n pushbackptrdatum and then the output in the terminal is just endless lines of this before i kill the program made it into for loop ptr 0x1cc3590 and ptrnext 0 ptrdatum 42 made it into for loop ptr 0x1cc35b0 and ptrnext 0 ptrdatum 42 made it into for loop ptr 0x1cc35d0 and ptrnext 0 ptrdatum 42 made it into for loop ptr 0x1cc35f0 and ptrnext 0 ptrdatum 42 made it into for loop ptr 0x1cc3610 and ptrnext 0 ptrdatum 42 made it into for loop ptr 0x1cc3630 and ptrnext 0 ptrdatum 42 made it into for loop ptr 0x1cc3650 and ptrnext 0 ptrdatum 42 made it into for loop ptr 0x1cc3670 and ptrnext 0 ptrdatum 42 made it into for loop ptr 0x1cc3690 and ptrnext 0 ptrdatum 42 made it into for loop ptr 0x1cc36b0 and ptrnext 0 ptrdatum 42 made it into for loop ptr 0x1cc36d0 and ptrnext 0 ptrdatum 42 made it into for loop ptr 0x1cc36f0 and ptrnext 0 ptrdatum 42 zmade it into for loop ptr 0x1cc3710 and ptrnext 0 ptrdatum 42 during each iteration clearly ptrnext is null and clearly the for loop should update ptr to ptrnext after each iteration so what could possibly be causing this error thanks in advance
student,should infinity infinity be infinity generally what should any infinity multiplied by another be
student,my listh class is implemented and works fine with all of my test cases but when i run stacktest00 the terminal just sits there with blankspace and does nothing and i have to quit using ctrlz when i run stacktest00 using valgrind i get the following 3502 leak summary 3502 definitely lost 0 bytes in 0 blocks 3502 indirectly lost 0 bytes in 0 blocks 3502 possibly lost 0 bytes in 0 blocks 3502 still reachable 429011616 bytes in 17875484 blocks 3502 suppressed 0 bytes in 0 blocks 3502 reachable blocks those to which a pointer was found are not shown 3502 to see them rerun with leakcheckfull showreachableyes 3502 3502 for counts of detected and suppressed errors rerun with v 3502 error summary 0 errors from 0 contexts suppressed 6 from 6 im really confused as to what could be causing the weird behavior of my stack class as im pretty sure everything is implemented correctly any ideas thanks
student,does do not modify the classs public interface imply that implementations of a default constructor destructor copy constructor and overloaded assignment operator need to go outside of the class declaration
student,when using erase should the iteration be invalid after the function is called would a loop like this not work for listanimaliterator ilbegin i lend i erasei because after the first erase the iterator should be deleted
student,my calccpp currently relies on isdigit i compiled it in caen without using any extra includes and it worked just fine does this mean that this function is ok to use in the final build
student,can we not use countif for the match operation what i did was creating a new stack and copying everything from the old stack to the new stack popping the new stack to count the number of times the first element occurs i tested the code and it was fine is this okay
student,ive created a functor class called match with a operator that compares an input to a member variable of the class however when i try and use this in the countif function i get this error on compiling calccpp7738 error no matching function for call to ‘stackrationalcountifmainmatch’ calccpp7738 note candidate is stackh807 note templateclass predicate int stackcountifpredicate const with predicate predicate t rational
student,everything compiles fine on mac but linux seems to be confused by python file does that mean i cant call make all on linux
student,hey guys in my pushfront function im starting by declaring a new node which has its datum set to the datum argued into the function however for some reason every time it sets the datum the datum of the node pointed to by first is also changed obviously first shouldnt be pointing to this node because this one is the one that i just created and first has not been assigned to it why is this happening thanks a lot
student,so if we have a rational which is 2 do we print out 2 or 2 1
student,
student,i really like labster and how it visualizes the objects and their memory i pasted my project 5 code into labster but it seems like there is still a lot of things labster doesnt cover like templates could you recommend any similar service out there for debugging where it will create a visual representation of the memory
student,my valgrind output is 3167 leak summary 3167 definitely lost 0 bytes in 0 blocks 3167 indirectly lost 0 bytes in 0 blocks 3167 possibly lost 0 bytes in 0 blocks 3167 still reachable 4096 bytes in 1 blocks 3167 suppressed 25209 bytes in 376 blocks which numbers have to be 0 to not have a memory leak is it all of them including still reachable and suppressed and is there some other program i need to run to check somewhere else
student,hi so i rewatched the lecture and i am still a little confused about iterator invalidation in the context of this project here are my questions 1 if we invalidate an iterator like in erase it is my understanding that the iterator pointer is now undefined and should not be used does that mean we should make it point to null to be safe 2 how does erase differ from the pop functions thank you
student,i am extremely confused because yesterday when i ran all my list test cases they passed today i ran them and 2 failed however the program did not crash and show assertion error messages any ideas on what could be happening the only thing i did in between yesterday and today is work on stackh any help would be much appreciated
student,im using the iterator to walk through the stack in calccpp and see if the first element of the stack matches other elements in the stack since iterator is in the list class though i cant walk through the stack how have people been keeping track of how many elements in the stack match the first element thanks
student,for the commands that require the stack to have at least a certain number of operands should we check this condition with assert or is this up to the user to make sure
student,
student,does enter stop while cin input for example int main string a while cin a do something cout a what i found out is that the cout a is never reached i simply typed 1 9 7 6 enter nothing is printed
student,if i set pointer a pointer b then increment pointer b does a still point to the same place as b
student,do we assume the inputs of calccpp are always valid or we have to check if it contains any illegal input such as negative integers or something like 2 if we do have to check the inputs what do we do when the input is not valid thanks
student,hello if there is only one node in a list and we delete it is it necessary to still set its next and prev to 0 or is it not necessary because the node is gone anyways thanks in advance
student,assume both list1 and list2 already exist and are wellformed and i call the copy constructor in the following line of code listint list2 listintlist1 it seems that upon calling my copy constructor for list sets list2s next and prev pointers to null so list2 is now treated as empty which creates a problem in the copying process i cant post my copy constructor here because of the honor code but nowhere in my copy constructor are next and prev explicitly initialized to 0 from debugging my code it appears that this initializing to null happens as soon as i call the copy constructor not later any idea why this might be happening
student,how is 2754 possible if listtcopyall is a private member function that is only used in the assignment operator function as in copyall is private and cannot be called in a test case
student,when you create a new node using dynamic memory do the next and prev pointers point to null by default and is datum undefined
student,so i finally fixed all my segfault errors and such but when i run through the tests the stringstream is only storing the numerator in my rational number not the or the second number my overide for my rational class is something similar to cout x y could this be the problem im confused on why its only storing the numerator it couts the correct rational number
student,when using the command make mytests in g is there a way to see which tests failed and which passed right now all i can see is a couple lines of output at the end that tell me how many tests failed and how many passed
student,ive read 3052 but im still a bit confused as to how i can know if there is no more input to read i went to office hours and a gsi told me that it ends when you input a newline but a closer look at the specs tells me that that isnt necessarily true
student,i am trying to write test cases for the assignment operator and the copy constructor and i can think of scenarios that cause a seq fault but i cannot think of an assert statement that would catch the problem basically if a lists pointers point to undefined things because the nodes previously there have been deleted how can we tell with an assert statement is it it even possible if not are we expected to have test cases for the assignment operator and copy constructor
student,hello im trying to use iterators to loop through the list like this for listtiterator ilistbegin i listend i code but i get these errors error need typename before listtiterator because listt is a dependent scope error expected before i error i was not declared in this scope i made sure to write templatetypename predicate above the function declaration so im confused as to why the compiler doesnt like this thanks in advance
student,for the list should firstprev be linked to first like firstprevnext first and lastnext be linked to last like lastnextprev last
student,should copyall in listh replace this with copies of all the nodes in l or should it append all the nodes in l onto this for example if this is 1 2 3 and l 4 5 6 should thiscopyalll result in 1 2 3 4 5 6 or 4 5 6
student,in my popfront function after changing the first pointer to point to the next element in the list i am trying to change the prev pointer of first to null i am using the line firstprev0 which is giving me an invalid write error in valgrind i have used this same syntax in other functions without this issue so im not sure what is causing it in this case
student,is autograder test stacktest00 same as the unit test for stack that were given to us if yes why my code pass the stacktest00 in caen computer but failed in autograder also is listtest01 a different test than test00 that is given to us
student,hi when submitting my project 5 to the autograder i encounter following confusing results which tells 22 for test00 and 02 for test01 however 00 failed to compile 01 complied successfully btw my program was able to compile and run on caen computer thanks submission results for tonny qianyus test case results listcompilecheck 11 listtest00 22 listtest01 02 rationaltest00 11 stacktest00 11 calctest00 11 calctest01 11 compiling student test cases student test listtest00cpp failed to compile student test listtest01cpp compiled successfully total score 811
student,hello im trying to declare a node ptr in stackh but it wont compile i declared it like this listtnode ptr listfirst the corresponding error message error ptr was not declared in this scope any advice on the correct way to do this or if were even allowed to do this thanks
student,for the third constructor that takes in numeratorin and denominator in do we need an initializer list at all if numeratorin and denominatorin are calculateddetermined inside the function then do i also need the numeratornumeratorin denominatordenominatorin at the top
student,so when we run all of our tests for listh we pass all tests have no memory leaks etc leading us to believe that our copy constructors and assignment operators all work fine however when we run stacktest00 for stackh we get a segfault or the program never ends and after stopping stacktest00 at various places weve determined that the line mystack stackcpy is the source of our segfault leading us to believe that it is the assignment operator that is causing the problem but all we do in the stack assignment operator for stack is set list equal to listrhs using the assignment operator from listh which seems to work fine for the list tests so we dont know how stacks assignment operator overload is causing a segfault when all its doing is using the assignment operator from listh which seems to work
student,help
student,i tried running calctest00in and my code ended up printing everything correctly up until the last line which somehow started an infinite loop printing the contents of the stack when i input the same calculator commands manually it works fine is this an issue with the fact that the in tests dont end with q if so how are we supposed to tell the calculator program to end
student,just want to check if this is ok since class cannot be static
student,for calccpp can we write a helper function in the file that perform each command for example for duplicate can we write a function that takes a stack pass by reference and does the desired action
student,currently im just trying to stub countif in stackh but im getting an error when attempting this template typename predicate int stackpredicatecountifpredicate pred const return 1 so i changed it to this template typename t template typename predicate int stacktcountifpredicate pred const return 1 and the error went away why
student,my size function works fine when i only create one list per test case as soon as i create another say mylist2 the size function segfaults i have found that it is segfaulting on the line iinext where i is a pointer to a node that starts at the first node and moves down the list
student,does stacktop return the datum associated with the last element entered or a reference to the node that was created when the last element was entered
student,i submitted my code about 20 minutes ago and the autograder still says that it is running is this normal or a bad sign i am getting a little worried
student,in our implementation of popfront and poplast do we need to set first and last to 0 if the list becomes empty im not getting a segmentation fault but am concerned these pointers will point to nothing after deleting the node
student,it seems like we are essentially given the definitions for iterator begin and iterator endand are told where the definitions should be placed in our code however when we call these functions we get an error that the we cannot use the custom constructor because it is private error ‘listtiteratoriteratorlisttnode with t int’ is private without moving the custom constructor from the private variables i have no clue how to fix this issue is it a scope resolution problem or are we missing something incredibly obvious
student,a lot of the posts about project 5 here are linked to 2780 but when i try accessing it i get not permitted is it an issue on my end if so how can i try resolving it
student,we think that erase is never used in calccpp right if so whats the point o implementing this function just an exercise for fun besides if we test this function we create an iterator i that points to a node but when erasei is called the node that i points to is gone right
student,so the spec says invariant 2 numerator and denominator should not have a common factor other than 1 eliminate any common factors currently i reduce right when a new rational is created in my constructor i see that it would also be possible to reduce only when get num or denom is called are both methods okay or should i switch over and do my reducing in the get fxns as opposed to the constructor itself
student,some posts say that we do not need to test destructors explicitly but what if we call llist and then assert that l is empty is that an acceptable way to test destructor thanks a lot
student,in visual studio cout in the function body works fine but in xcode we have to change it to stdcout why thanks a lot
student,should we follow project 4 protocol and write a comment in regards to specific behavior and etc
student,looking 2902 we saw that we can create stacks copy constructor using lists copy constructor but were having trouble with accessing it i know the above post says that you can because its a member function but can someone explain a little bit more since its private doesnt that mean that we cant i dont understand the class vs object difference in terms of accessing functions thanks
student,im a bit confused on how to run valgrind on calccpp the program wont stop running unless you type q so when i run the valgrind leak check i notice that it doesnt ever stop unless i type q and then it prints out my leak summery and finishes am i doing this correctly
student,can we assume that insert will not be called with i pointing at the very front or very back of the list because push front and back would be used in those instances or should we set up insert to call push front or back if i points to either of those positions
student,should our list test cases test that next and prev node pointers point correctly for example if the list is size 1 canshould we test that the prev pointer points to 0 and that the next pointer points to 0
student,my code has been running for almost an hour now and im feeling selfconscious
student,for some reason when stack runs the implicit destructor i get a bad access error in my listh usually for size but sometimes itll put it in a different function sometimes when i step through my code its telling me that the list of 1 element has addresses for next and prev but no datum assigned to them other times i step through the entire thing and have no error and main exits code 0 anyone know why this could be happening super confusing to fix because it only happens sometimes by the way im running the given test file for stack any help would be greatly appreciated
student,what does invalid write of size 8 mean in simple terms
student,do we only submit tests for list this time for grading purpose tests for rational class are only for our own programming
student,the spec says if we have numerator 4 and denominator 3 then we should print 43 so if we have numerator 4 and denominator 3 should we print 43 or should we bring the negative sign up to the numerator every time
student,what should the valgrind command be to get the program to check our project for memory leaks i followed what we did for lab 11 but valgrind is just sitting there and doing nothing and has been for almost 10 minutes
student,sorry if this has been asked already a brief search through piazza didnt turn up anything that seemed to fully answer this question is a defaultconstructed iterator required to behave the same as the end iterator certainly certain implementations of listtend will have this behavior but is this what is expected of our implementation so for instance if my current implementation of list satisfies the rme for all member functions and otherwise behaves correctly but doesnt have end iterator0 is this a problem note that stdlisttiterator from the standard library does not have this behavior or at least my compilers implementation of it doesnt
student,when is the alternate final exam scheduled for
student,my valgrind output is 3167 leak summary 3167 definitely lost 0 bytes in 0 blocks 3167 indirectly lost 0 bytes in 0 blocks 3167 possibly lost 0 bytes in 0 blocks 3167 still reachable 4096 bytes in 1 blocks 3167 suppressed 25209 bytes in 376 blocks does this mean that im good or is there somethingsomewhere else i need to check
student,so i read online that each container type has a specific iterator type does this mean that by default things like lists and such have iterators under the hood or for the purposes of the exam should we assume that iterators will always be defined in a class if we have access to them
student,how would we go about testing a stack of rationals in a way that the autograder can test if we only include rationalh it wont be able to compile correctly unless our g command uses rationalcpp can we be assured that rationalcpp will be included or is that not a case we should test
student,im getting a segmentation fault 11 that happens when i try to push a value onto a stack that ive created ive narrowed it down and it has to be this ive included all the h and libraries necessary for my code to work but i dont know why its not working it happens with any type of stack so its not a rational issue
student,if you have two iterators i and j and you say i j this means they point at the same list correct so changing a value or inserting or deleting or whatever using i would also change the list for j because its the same list correct
student,in the spec it says use c strings instead of cstrings my question is is it ok if we use c strings for switch statements in calccpps main
student,the only test cases we submit to the autograder are for list correct there is some discussion about other test cases as a i am writing regardless but under submission it says your list test cases i figured if it was for listh only it would be a little more explicit or have a capital l right now i have been reading it as my list of a all the test cases i prepared thanks and i searched for this answer prior and didnt find anything
student,is it possible to access individual elements of a list other than the beginning so far all of my asserts have looked something like this assertmylistfront some integer how can we access elements other than the front thank you in advance
student,allowed
student,it says that for quit this input is always valid does this mean that if i typed in z for example which the program doesnt have a command for z will also cause the program to quit
student,i tried following the advice given in the followups to some of the other piazza posts on here but i keep getting an error saying that list is an undeclared identifier and that left of begin and left of end must have classstructunion has anyone had the same problem
student,im a little confused as to what invariant 3 actually means so if someone could go into more detail about it that i would appreciate it
student,when i run the valgrind leak check on each of my tests individually it tells me all heaps are freed however when i run this check on make mytests it tells me that there are bytes and blocks still reachable why is valgrind doing this to me does anyone know of a potential causesolutionplace to look for the error
student,i was wondering about how subtraction should work when there are multiple subtractions in a row for example if you had the expression 3 2 1 which is 0 and made it rpn it would be 1 2 3 in the calculator you would push all three numbers on the stack then pop the first two 1 and 2 and subtract 2 1 1 and push that back on the stack to have 1 3 if you did this again the answer would be two how do we handle this inconsistency
student,just a little confused what we should do if the user wants to do rational r00 because the common denominator is not 1 is this legit
student,there seem to be office hours scheduled on the calendar in 1695 bbb but no gsi is here
student,are office hours at 1030 canceled today
student,when i over write my operator the return type i write is list instead of listt i get one error invalid use of templatename ‘list’ without an argument list i find in lecture 19 page 8 it says list operator const list rhs which one is right
student,for the print function in rationalcpp how should 01 which is just 0 00 undefined and all the variations on infinity be printed to the output i cant seem to find a clear answer to this on piazza or in the spec thanks
student,must we test the requires clause in class we are told to defensively program against violating the requires clauses assertempty for front for example should i include a test case that tests for front with an empty list
student,i dont quite understand the command of q are we just call return 0 in the main function to quit the calculator what does it mean by saying endoffile will cause the program to end are we supposed to read command from a file instead of typing them in
student,it is not explicitly mentioned in the spec but according to the effect negate can only be performed on nonempty stack
student,the specs only say what we can include in calccpp are we allowed to include cmath in rationalcpp
student,im running into an interesting problem with trying to free the heap when i call the dtor using popall that calls popfront until the list is empty it appears like the list gets destroyed but then just before ending i trigger a breakpoint in the freec library line 50 to be exact how ever when i call the dtor using popall that uses popback no such breakpoint is triggered i am as positive as i can be that the two functions are written the exact same way one just starting from the other side i have googled this but still have no idea what is going on another interesting thing this error only happens when running in visual studio i ran this on caen and got no errors please help
student,if the denominator is negative should we make the numerator negative and make the denominator positive
student,how do you return the element instead of a reference to the element for pop instead of a reference to the location of the element
student,can we making it static of course
student,when i try to use pop on the stack i keep getting the error cannot convert from const stackint to stackintwhy
student,i followed some posts on piazza to figure out how to test iterator erase but im getting an error when compiling and im not sure exactly what im doing wrong listint list listpushfront1 listpushback2 listpushback3 listintiterator i listbegin listerasei this results a bunch of apple mach o linker errors and im not sure why thanks
student,can we have member functions like popall in stackh
student,is the most recent pushed number considered as the top element
student,so im getting this error munmapchunk invalid pointer in my list destructorand im not really sure why i did the same popall method as in lecture so im not really sure why this is happening any help would be appreciated
student,can someone explain this line of the spec endoffile eg typing controld on linux must also cause the calculator to exit with status 0 also how can you end the calculator now i just have a loop that runs until a q is inputted what if a q is never inputted though how do i end the calculator
student,so i sent my project to the autograder and under the test case results section of the email i got from the autograder i got 2 points off on my listtest01 what exactly is this doing listtest01 works for me on caen so does it run it against buggy code
student,when implementing the copy constructor as seen below in a screenshot from the lecture slides why do we initialize the front and back pointers to null dont we want those pointers to actually point to the first and last elements in the list
student,were getting this error when i compile on mac but on caen linux is this something we should be worried about stacktest00541320x7fff72acf300 malloc error for object 0x7ff6d9c04b00 pointer being freed was not allocated set a breakpoint in mallocerrorbreak to debug abort trap 6
student,i keep getting this error when compiling calccpp in caen and i dont know what it means i dont exactly know how to explain it but this error appears with all of my helper functions of type rational and each time i declare and initialize a rational number within main ie rational first stackpop any ideas thanks
student,assume we have node first which points to the first node in the list does the following code move the first pointer to the next linked node or does it assign the value of the next linked node to the node that first points to first firstnext in other words does this code move a pointer or copy a node
student,bash41 make listtest00 g wall werror pedantic o1 listtest00cpp o listtest00 tmpccobvwxao in function main listtest00cpptext0x3d undefined reference to listpushfrontint const listtest00cpptext0x52 undefined reference to listpushbackint const listtest00cpptext0x67 undefined reference to listpushbackint const listtest00cpptext0x6f undefined reference to listfront const listtest00cpptext0x95 undefined reference to listpopfront listtest00cpptext0x9d undefined reference to listback const listtest00cpptext0xc3 undefined reference to listpopback collect2 ld returned 1 exit status what does this error mean
student,are we allowed to add private member functions to the list class i am trying to implement a copy constructor the way it was shown in lecture which requires adding the private member function pushall
student,for some reason whenever i run my program in the terminal whenever i type in n to negate the number the terminal throws back a floating point exception this doesnt happen in visual studio i have looked for dividing by zero and it simply doesnt look like its happening i pop off the top element of the stack and store it in a temporary rational number container then i push back another rational number with the temporary numerator 1 and the denominator as was onto the stack again but g doesnt like it is there any reason this would cause a floating point exception
student,in the lectures folder on the google drive there are a bunch of cpp files that contain code used in the lecture slides a lot of this code has the exact same implementations of the functions we are supposed to implement in listh of project5 my question is how much of this code can we copypaste if any
student,should our implementations for operator overloading be public or private
student,what is the maximum number of commands you will enter during calccpp
student,how can we test the constructor of iterator how do we know the nodeptr element has been initialized to 0
student,breakpoint 2 0x00000000004010a0 in main gdb call test1 1 0 gdb print 2 0 gdb next single stepping until exit from function main which has no line number information stacktest00 listh90 void listtpopfront with t int assertion empty failed our popfront has an assert statement at line 90 which checks to make sure the list is not empty i dont know why popfront would even be called after the first line in the main function though not sure whatwhy is causing this
student,does deleting a node also delete its next and prev pointers i mean the actual pointers not the things they point to
student,what is the proper way to declare an iterator in stackh i have listtiterator ilistbegin but it doesnt seem to be working and im not sure why thanks
student,i am getting the following error when i try to compile all the list tests using the command make mytests can someone please help me figure out whats going on
student,does anyone know where exactly these tutors are in the ugli basement
student,hi all so the spec says we will be using standard input cin but given the in files will we be reading from the keyboard or do we need to code to read files ie opening a file etc and if so what is said file name it just seems like there is some conflicting information
student,would 20 be considered positive or negative infinity i think itd be positive infinity because 0 is still 0 but i just wanted to make sure
student,says ugli basement in the google calendar and they usually have a sign but theres no one here thanks
student,it is giving me this error for the line int num atoiinput where input is a char variable any idea
student,valgrind tells me i have 24 bytes of memory definitely lost and 24 bytes indirectly lost can anyone give me advice on where to look for these memory leaks are there any sources that typically result in 24 bytes leaked
student,i like to use cinget or systempause above the return 0 to automatically pause the code i know that systempause is bad code and it wont compile in the autograder anyways but what about cinget would this be fine to keep in our files or will it cause problems
student,just to clear things up does delete automatically call destructor and does new automatically call the constructor
student,ive seen conflicting answers to this so id like an instructor confirmation on this can insert be called on an empty list as i understand a valid iterator points to an existing node not 0 but an empty list contains begin end 0 so our assert valid is failing when we call insert on an empty list
student,when i use public list fcns in stackh i get the error illegal call of nonstatic member function is my syntax incorrect
student,are we allowed to include stdioh in our test case files this library is already included when you make a new file in xcode and i am not sure if we have to delete it given that it is not mentioned in the spec as one of the libraries we are allowed to include
student,i submitted an infinite loop to the autograder is there any way i can end it so i can submit another one
student,im having trouble figuring out how to print out the stack are we allowed to includestring into stackh
student,a compiler error notified me that in the loop for countif i needed to use typename listtiterator i listbegin instead of listtiterator i listbegin could someone please explain to me why this is the case it works fine now of course i have just never seen typename used this way
student,is there a way to run tests of calctest00in and calctest01in without manually inputting the text of the files at the command line
student,why does list use typename t and use typename u for overloaded output operator is there any particular reason or is it arbitrary can they not be the same variable if so what would happen thanks
student,when we create a local t variable called result and then return it we get an error on x code saying reference to stack memory associated with local variable result returned but it worked fine on visual studio we changed it to just return the front item of list and it did not create an error on xcode any more why is this and what does it mean thanks
student,are we allowed to overload the operator in rationalcpp
student,for checking if one list equals another list in the assignment operator can a lists have the same size same firsts and same lasts but still be different is the only way to check if they are the same by going through each node
student,10 10 a 10 b 00
student,calling a different constructor within a constructor initializer list circlecircledouble radin ellipseradin radin vs within the function body circlecircledouble radin ellipseradin radin which way is correct better and why would it make a difference if we were calling a custom constructor of the same class like in project 5 iterator thanks
student,heres how i understand countif the function iterates through a list and evaluates each individual element by passing it in to a predicate if the predicate returns true for that individual element we increment a count variable after looping through the entire list we return that count is my thinking correct thanks very much in advance
student,we create a rational object and set it equal to something that returns an int value this works but we want to understand exactly what happens does it automatically call rationals custom constructor that takes exactly one int the one that we are required to implement in rationalcpp thanks
student,can we just return 0 can you further explain the spec description of q saying endoffile eg typing control d on linux must also cause the calculator to exit with status 0 thanks
student,can you use the iterator after you use it to erase where should the iterator erase after you delete the element
student,in calccpp while using a switch statement the switch expression is a dereferenced const char in our cases we have case however we initially tried and got an error message saying expression is not an integral constant expression we learned that we should use for declaring a cstring so what is this error and what does it mean thanks
student,in calccpp we create a string and read in inputs into it within this while loop we create a cstring const char sc scstr and have a switch statement switch sc originally we had switch sc but got an error message saying statement requires expression of integer type const char invalid when we add it compiles without a problem why do we have to dereference the char to make switch work correctly thanks a lot
student,stackh says that the user must be able to destroy a stack but since we didnt create any new stacks then we shouldnt need a destructor right if we dont need a destructor then how would one destroy a stack
student,so when i run my code through valgrind i get this as output i just want instructor clarification that this is what is expected to be returned from valgrind and in this specific cpp file i would not be marked down for memory leaks thank you
student,should we be able to call insert on an empty list
student,in order to return the number of elements in the stack for which preddatum is true im incrementing a variable in my for loop whenever preddatum evaluates to true im having trouble figuring out what to pass in as an argument we need get the datum of the current node that is being pointed to do we need to use the front function and then popfront to go through all elements of the list this means the list would be modified until it is empty is that allowed
student,so ive been running my code through tests upon tests but my assert statements are not printing out in terminal when the fail instead the whole test just aborts and counts as a fail while this is okay for the autograder i believe since they are still counted as fails its a pain when debugging can anyone offer an explanation why this could be happening seg faults maybe thanks
student,im getting this error when i try to compile my code and im 99 sure its because of the operator g wall werror pedantic o1 stacktest00cpp o stacktest00 undefined symbols for architecture x8664 operatorstd1basicostreamchar std1chartraitschar stackint const referenced from main in stacktest00f107ddo ld symbols not found for architecture x8664 clang error linker command failed with exit code 1 use v to see invocation make stacktest00 error 1
student,when the spec says this input is always valid in the calc clear function does that mean we should assert if the stack is empty so that we dont try to pop an empty stack
student,valgrind tells me when running stacktest00cpp that i have a bunch of memory leaks when i try to do something like node temp new node i mean im sure my destructor takes care of deallocating the memory for me and from previous posts im 100 sure you have to allocate space for a node first
student,with the given formula for addition ab cd adbcbd infinity plus infinity should yield 00 but intuitively shouldnt the answer be infinity do we need an if statement or am i making a mistake
student,for question 2d on the mid term which asked what the size of an int was on the machine with main 914328 p 01 etc it said that it was copypasted from the lecture slides where exactly in the lecture slides was this i cant find it but i am sure it is in there somewhere
student,in the spec it says that the submission tar will include listh stackh rationalcpp calccpp and your list test cases but says nothing about test cases for rational or stack yet in the paragraph that immediately follows it says that the autograder portion of the project will compile our code our own unit tests for the three classes these directives seem to be contradictory should we be including rationaltestnncpp files and stacktestnncpp files or just listtestnncpp files
student,hi after dtor runs and the program is about to exit i get a message saying my project has triggered a breakpoint the breakpoint appears to be from crtexec and in the line ifndef crtapp exitmainret any ideas
student,why cant we use an iterator of type t in stackh in order to have t be rational we included template typename t before the class definition for stack for listtiterator i listbegin i listend i
student,for the countif function when we call predicate on another function say bool countduplicatesrational number that determines if a number in the list is a duplicate how can we tell countduplicates which number to compare it too in other words how can we tell countduplicates which two rational numbers to compare if we can only pass in one number
student,is 4 0 equal to a 1 0 or b 1 0
student,what is the purpose of the insert and erase functions aside from testing the functions in our list tests i am not seeing anywhere that we would need to use them
student,for listtest00 on xcode we pass but for caen we get an assertion on empty after popfront is called the list should hold 2 3 but apparently it is empty so our popfront is popping everything in the list any ideas thanks
student,a lot of people have been in 1695 bbb and the office hour queue hasnt moved in a long time was office hours canceled
student,lets say an iterator points to an element in a list for example the 8 in 4 9 8 2 3 and lets call the iterator itr1 now lets insert an element so that the list is now 4 9 22 8 2 3 if we make a new iterator itr2 that points to the 8 in the postinserted list is the statement itr2itr1 necessarily true or could a correct implementation of insert completely recreate the list so that the pointers to nodes from the preinserted list are completely recreated using new and delete from the postinserted list
student,can we add using namespace std to calccpp
student,im curious as to why the rmes above these two functions say that you can pass in spushitem into pop or top when they dont have any arguments
student,im running into a segfault with erase somehow and i cannot figure out why to rundown my logic briefly i create pointers to nodes for the iterator the previous node of the iterator p and the next node of the iterator n i then set ps next node to be n and i set ns prev node to be p however i can see in my watches while debugging that when i set p to be the previous node of the iterator it gives the memory location 0xbaadf00d aka bad food which from what ive read is that it shows uninitialised allocated heap memory when the debug heap is used im not too sure why this is happening the list im testing is a simple 1 2 3 list and im trying to erase the 2 and make 1 and 3 point to each other
student,in project for the stackh file in empty when i have a simple line that says return listempty the compiler still gives me an error saying that list was not declared in scope why wouldnt list be declared if it is a private member variable
student,should prev point to 0 if there is only one element in the list
student,can someone explain why this would be the case
student,can we include cmath for rationalcpp in project 5
student,are we allowed to assert with the stl while testing
student,the requires clause for the insert function says the following requires i is a valid iterator associated with this list i wrote a test case where i have an iterator initially pointing to end so end and i can insert an elment so the size goes from 0 to 1 the next step of the test case is to pass an iterator at the end again and insert a new element this doesnt work because when when the size of the list is 1 and the iterator points to 0 it is impossible for me to adjust the node pointers in a way to include this new element that should be inserted i am fairly sure that having a list of size 1 and passing in a iterator that points to null doesnt satisfy the valid iterator part of the requires clause is this right valid iterator seems a little vague so i am unsure
student,for each command as noted in the specs there is a required number of operands should we put asserts for each command to check for the min number of operands
student,are we allowed to use c strings and if not can we use cstr to convert strings to cstrings
student,the begin and end functions are called by the countifpredicate pred function in the stack class however when i try to use an iterator for loop to iterate through the stacks list i get this error in file included from stackh9 listh in instantiation of ‘listintiterator’ stackh142 instantiated from ‘int stacktcountifpredicate const with predicate bool int t int’ stacktest00cpp57 instantiated from here listh131 error template argument required for ‘struct stack’ listh in member function ‘listtiterator listtbegin const with t int’ stackh142 instantiated from ‘int stacktcountifpredicate const with predicate bool int t int’ stacktest00cpp57 instantiated from here listh138 error ‘listtiteratoriteratorlisttnode with t int’ is private listh146 error within this context listh in member function ‘listtiterator listtend const with t int’ stackh142 instantiated from ‘int stacktcountifpredicate const with predicate bool int t int’ stacktest00cpp57 instantiated from here listh138 error ‘listtiteratoriteratorlisttnode with t int’ is private listh151 error within this context is there something wrong with how i set up my for loop fortypename listtiterator i listbegin i listend i
student,when implementing the iterator class in the list class i added this copy constructor iteratoriterator other nodeptrothernodeptr there should be something wrong with this copy constructor since it prevents the following code in main from compiling for listdoubleiterator i mylistbegin i mylistend i i received following mistake message listtest01cpp2731 error no matching constructor for initialization of listdoubleiterator however i dont know why this happen can some one help me find out whats wrong with the copy constructor thanks
student,the effects clause for front and back state that it returns a reference to the firstlast datum in the list respectively but based on the return type t shouldnt we be returning what is stored in that node ie 8 if that is the datum in the firstlast node
student,should our code be able to make lists of lists of a certain type for example would list listint lists be a valid test case for this project or is that too far
student,for our test cases for listh should we be testing the iterators as well
student,i checked all my function in list in valgrind and i got no leaks are possible for all functions does it actually means that i dont need to worry about the memory leakage if not what should i do
student,my output for calctest00 prints out the last line of output twice so should our program print out the stack before it returns 0 or should it only print when a or p is put in the standard input stream
student,ive been looking for a definitive answer but no one has supplied one if i have a list of nodes node 1 node 2 node 3 and i erase node 2 the code should make the new list of nodes node 1 node 3 but after we delete node 2 using an iterator the iterator points to a spot in memory that no longer exists and will have unexpected behavior if we try to increment or decrement it my question is should we make it point to node 1 node 3 or expect the user to create a new iterator if they wish to do anything else with iterators
student,does erase require the list be nonempty thank you
student,are we allowed to use atoi and its respective library in the calculator when trying to convert string to int or what are we supposed to use
student,i got this error whenever i create an iterator instance such as listintiterator i mylistbegin i thought it was because the edge case of the popfront where there is only one element left to be deleted i fixed this and tested the edge case it runs well but when i create an iterator instance as above the error appears again and is still from the line delete i in my popfront function i am wondering how i can fix this error thanks
student,so when we were going through the code in the rme for listfront and listback it says returns a reference to the firstlast element in the list however in listtest00cpp is the following line assertmylistfront 1 where mylistfront which we expected to be a pointer to the datum is actually being tested as if it is the datum this problem carries over into stackpop and stacktop as well i was wondering if we could get some clarification as to what should actually be returned from these functions
student,so i wrote my overload function of the operator for stack and i believe i included it right had a lot of trouble here but now when i run the stacktest00 it wont compile with the following error i am extremely confused any help thanks
student,how should we get the user input in calccpp if the input varies between int and char i thought to treat it like a stream where i could have it try to read an integer by default and when reading an integer fails then have it reset the stream and read a char but cinclear doesnt seem to reset the buffer any suggestions
student,hey when i am running gdb for project 5 specifically running it through listtest00 i am unable to step into the functions and see exactly how the program is working once i start the program it executes all the way through is there a way to avoid this
student,setting two rational numbers equals to each other should work since you only need to copy the numerator and denominator member variables together which would be a shallow copy correct
student,could someone give me a brief laymans term explanation of why the compiler made me use typename when i tried to declare an iterator in the stack countif function ive done a fair amount of googling and so far the only thing i understood was thatwell actually now that i think about it im not really sure that i gained anything from what i read lol thanks
student,if i want to test my listh code in valgrind how do i do that in terminal what is the name of the program that i use in the command line for valgrind
student,so i am able to compile all of my code on the caen network and it works and compiles but when i submit to the autograder calctest00 calctest01 and rationaltest00 dont compile arent calctest just in files
student,i would like to make a functor and was wondering if i had to declare it static ex static class name also the spec says any helper functions you declare must be private if in a class but that is not possible with a functor so any tips for what to do about this
student,do we have to consider for invalid inputs such as c7 5 a etc
student,construct an iterator at a specific position iteratornode p can we assume the node pointer passed in to the constructor will actually point to something in the list if not what should the behavior be when the desired node is not in the list thanks
student,ive looked on piazza regarding the default constructor for stack 2840 i followed the student response in implementing a default constructor but in my stacktest00cpp i get an error when declaring stack s it says that there is no matching constructor for initialization of stackint how can i fix this
student,how is the input into the calculator formatted is it like 1 enter 2 enter enter or 1 2 enter also with the caltest00 given do i have to input that and compare it with the correct file manually or does it have to read in the lines from the file
student,hello i am trying to implement the operator for rationalcpp i keep getting an error saying the function should only take in one argument i redownloaded rationalh again to make sure i didnt mess something up there error ‘stdostream rationaloperatorstdostream const rational’ must take exactly one argument stdostream rationaloperatorstdostream os const rational obj the error is on this line code any ideas as to why thanks in advance
student,ive run the autograder and ive failed the calctests even though when i run them myself they all work there are no infinite loops in my code that i can see and valgrind does not give any memory leaks i dont understand why its taking so long can anyone give any possibilities
student,i just realized that in my listh no matter what i typed inside the class even something like sdsdadsa visual studio is not underlining the errors however if i put the same thing outside of the class it show specify the errors is there a way to fix that thanks
student,regarding the 3 invariants in rationalh should those all be taken care of in the constructors for example if i use any of the 0 can i assume that the invariant holds true before i use that function thanks in advance
student,since we cannot use stoi and i search a few post saying that we should use atoi but the spec says use c strings instead of c strings so can we use c string or not its really confusing
student,i keep getting this error message stackh123 error no type named ‘iterator’ in ‘class listint can someone explain to me which part of my code might not work thanks
student,right now i use the iterator to traverse the stack how do i print out the datum at each node though right now my code inside my for loop is os i return os but this is not working can anyone point me in the right direction thanks
student,can we add using namespace std to listh and stackh
student,or do we have to manually compare them because our calccpp passes the given tests when i see them manually but it fails it when it goes through the autograder
student,the spec says we should write the default constructor destructor copy constructor and overloaded assignment operator if we find we need them should we also turn in test cases for these fxns as well or is that not going to be a criteria were graded on since some of them might be optional noteim not asking if we have to do our own testing to make sure our fxns work properly obviously i know that we have to do that im inquiring on whether or not the faulty autograder files will require tests for these things to get full test case points
student,hello for all my public iterator functions default i get the following error message i showed an example for my function but the same message is shown for all my iterator functions listh5612 error ‘listtiterator listtiteratoroperator with t int’ is private iterator operator referring to this line i wrote all of these inside the iterator class to avoid scoping issues with the t variable and i also made sure to befriend the class list under private in the iterator class any advice thanks in advance
student,are we able to use popfront or popback from listh in pop of stackh
student,when i run valgrind with my calccpp and enter only q the output says that ive possibly lost 26 bytes in 1 block however all of the errors listed have something to do with either stdstring or stdchar this is from the heap summary 8631 26 bytes in 1 blocks are possibly lost in loss record 1 of 1 8631 at 0x4a075fc operator newunsigned long vgreplacemallocc298 8631 by 0x3e2769c3c8 stdstringrepscreateunsigned long unsigned long stdallocatorchar const in usrlib64libstdcso6013 8631 by 0x3e2769d19a stdstringrepmclonestdallocatorchar const unsigned long in usrlib64libstdcso6013 8631 by 0x3e2769d5eb stdstringreserveunsigned long in usrlib64libstdcso6013 8631 by 0x3e2767bff4 stdbasicistreamchar stdchartraitschar stdgetlinechar stdchartraitschar stdallocatorchar stdbasicistreamchar stdchartraitschar stdbasicstringchar stdchartraitschar stdallocatorchar char in usrlib64libstdcso6013 8631 by 0x40156d runcalc in afsumicheduusersosolthoffdocumentseecs 280 projectsp5project5calc 8631 by 0x401601 main in afsumicheduusersosolthoffdocumentseecs 280 projectsp5project5calc im really not sure what to make of this and im definitely not familiar with these string functions anyone have any tips thanks
student,how do we access listh functions in stackh right now in stackh my empty function is bool empty const return listempty the compiler says error templateclass t class list used without template parameters every time i try to access a member function or variable of listh with list i get this same error how can we used the listh functions thanks
student,for the list ctors do we need to make one that allows the user to enter as many numbers as they want and then create a list from that ex enter list 3 5 6 7 8 9 10 and then from there we need to make a list like that or do we only need a default ctor
student,i am figuring out my schedule for next semester and was wondering what the discussion situation was for eecs 281370 is it similar to 280 where you can go to any discussionnot go at all without being penalized thanks
student,how would we implement a copy constructor and overload assignment operator in rational when there isnt a declaration in the h file
student,i got very lazy constantly having to run the make file and then valgrind on every single test case to test even the slightest of changes i made to the project to ensure that i dont have any leaks or uninitalized errors so i threw together this script that compiles everything runs all the unit tests runs all the regression tests for calc and then performs all these tests with valgrind and then processes the lengthy valgrind outputs into this simplified output where you can easily tell if something is wrong and what caused the error i thought some of you might find this useful so i put it on github you can get this script at httpsgithubcommanavgabhawalaeecs280project5tester you need to have a mac with xcode to be able to run this script since its written in swift at the moment if people like it a lot i will create a python script too so that you can run this on linux but im still trying to figure out regex with python to process the valgrind outputs feel free to help me out with that if you know how to do that you can find all the how to and what stuff means on the readme on github if you find a bug feel free to create an issue or if you know some swift and want to somehow help make this better create a new pull request since this is basically just an enhanced makefile i assume that this should not be an honor code violation if an instructor thinks that it is i will take this down
student,i am having trouble calling list function within stacki keep getting the error illegal call of nonstatic member fcn
student,what does this mean i keep getting it when i try to compile my stackh file for the basic test stackh12 error unterminated conditional directive ifndef stackh
student,can iterator function operator be called on list with 1 node
student,the two test cases for calc are failing to compile on the autograder i ran the provided test cases on caen and everything seem to work just fine can someone please tell me the reason thanks
student,listint listptr new listint listptrpushback1 delete listptr listptr 0 assertlistptrempty is it invalid to call on empty after we have deleted a list
student,from the spec duplicate pop the top item off the stack and push two copies of the number onto the top of the stack this requires a stack with at least one operand does it matter if we dont pop it off and just push another copy of it onto the stack the end result is the same thing and has the same requirement that it needs one element is there some magical test case that will detect if we didnt use pop or something
student,is there a reason why public member functions in listt would not be able to access first and last which are private member variables in listt i am running into this problem and i am not sure whats going on
student,is it supposed to take this long
student,ive read all the other posts but i still dont understand how were supposed to handle inputs for calccpp i get how it works when we run it from the terminal but are we supposed to to handle if its from a file i only ask this because my project has been on the autograder queue for like 10 minutes and i just fear that i have an infinite loop can anyone help
student,using the decrement operator overload implementation in listiterator as an example here why do we return this at the end im not clear on what this is
student,does anyone know why i am getting this error and how to fix this
student,the operator is implemented in lishh can we use it in our test file
student,can we assume that iterator will not be modified after passed into insert it means if an iterator points to 3 before call insert in the list 13 57 it will still point to 3 after we insert a node before 3
student,is there any way to assert that the pos pointer doesnt pass the end of the array
student,when im trying to put the first new element into a list using pushfront i receive a segmentation fault ive narrowed down the issue to a line which states pprev 0 where p is node p new node and i cant figure out why valgrind would state that im accessing the wrong memory the exact error message is access not within mapped region at address 0x10 33222 at 0x400a89 listintpushfrontint const listh64 33222 by 0x4008d1 main listtest00cpp9 ideas
student,just to clarify is the last element of the list the top element on the stack
student,so apparently one of the new fads on the internet is taking a photo of yourself with a chicken on your shoulder ie httpimgurcom3ajh7lb now the question is will we see professor deorio joining in on this
student,i wonder if the list is sorted and the dereference of iterator enables others to change the datum of the node within the list will that be a problem by unsorting the original the list i have this question because the return type of opertaor is t instead of t
student,is it sufficient to test using int do we have to test using listchar
student,in calc we are supposed to cin everything but if we do whilecin something isnt that only take one type of data as string or int is there a way to find out which type
student,getting this error when i return this in my t pop function in the tests if the typename t is declared as an int since we overloaded the dereference operator it should return the datum which is an int so im not sure how to fix this compiler error stackh4812 error no viable conversion from stackint to int return this
student,the project spec says that reverse r in the postfix calculator should pop the top two items off the stack push the first popped item onto the top of the stack and then push the second item onto the top of the stack this just reverses the order of the top two items on the stack so for a stack with 5 items are we only going to flip the first twotop two items and leave the rest in order or are we reversing all items 5 in the stack
student,when i assign list by using listts copy constructor on other the compiler quietly yells at me saying that there are no matching functions
student,what is the equivalent expression for an initializer list what i mean is that what function must be implemented in order to be able to use an initializer list on an object for example if i wanted to do a copy constructor for some class c ontainer that has a list member variable called list and i wanted to do something like containercontainer cin listcinlist what function is this calling in the list class the copy constructor
student,in order to the print the elements i want to dereference an iterator but the compiler says that it doesnt recognize list even though i already declared the operator function as a friend function in stack how would one access lists member functions
student,aside from the operator isnt the iterator in our project the same as the one presented in the lecture slides aka can we just copy past that code
student,my partner submitted our code to the autograder put both of our names on the file but i did not receive an email with the results we have submitted multiple times now this never occurred in any of the previous projects does anybody know whats wrong thank you
student,so i was implementing my countif function which requires two templates one for the stack type and one for the predicate i tried a few ways to do this method 1 template typename predicate typename t int stacktcountifpredicate pred const this gives the error stackh136 error invalid use of incomplete type ‘class stackt’ stackh16 error declaration of ‘class stackt’ where line 136 is the function and line 16 is class stack method 2 template typename t typename predicate int stacktcountifpredicate pred const this gives the error stackh136 error prototype for ‘int stacktcountifpredicate const’ does not match any in class ‘stackt’ stackh60 error candidate is templateclass t templateclass predicate int stackcountifpredicate const where line 136 is the function and line 60 is the function prototype inside the class declaration method 3 template typename predicate template typename t int stacktcountifpredicate pred const this gives the error stackh137 error invalid use of incomplete type ‘class stacku’ stackh16 error declaration of ‘class stacku’ where line 137 is the function and line 16 is the start of the class definition method 4 template typename t template typename predicate int stacktcountifpredicate pred const of course i tried this after half an hour of pulling my hair and wondering why the others didnt work and of course it compiled whats wrong with the first three methods for 1 and 2 i saw a few examples of people online using this way and apparently they worked
student,are 01 and 00 both valid rational numbers in this project and if so when comparing them with the operator how should they behave
student,in the public function section under class iterator there is only one operator which is operator however when i implement the stackh i think it would be nice if i can have more iterator can i add some more iterator public functions
student,for countif since we have two typenames one t and one predicate should we do this template typename t template typename predicate int stacktcountifpredicate pred const or this template typename t template class predicate int stacktcountifpredicate pred const
student,will the compiler give me an error if i had a double delete
student,page two at proj 5 prompt to push you can simply add an element at one end of the list either end will do to pop you simply remove the element from the same end of the list however in the starter file of stack modifies this effects pushes an item onto the top of the stack template typename t void stacktpushconst t item also effects removes the item at the top and returns it eg popspushitem results in the stack being equivalent to s and returns the item so what exactly we are supposed to do
student,in my popfront i create a victim pointer just like the example in lecture to point to first then make the next node in the list the new first node then i set the prev pointer of the first node to be zero because first should not have a previous node then i delete the victim however im getting a segfault when i do that third step setting prev equal to zeronull and not getting the segfault when i comment that line out why is this not correct thanks in advance
student,will the autograder also make sure that we have working test cases for the private functions in out classes for example the private iterator functions in the list class
student,in lecture i saw that we used delete with the iterator by doing delete i then the code is i 0 what is the point of this second part if i dont include i 0 are there any negative ramifications
student,hi im currently able to access the private list variable in the overridden operator in the stack class ive added dummy functions into the private section as well and i can access those too i have commented out my friend declaration and it still works could someone please explain how this is possible
student,i read the spec a few times but i still have no idea how it works does it read from a file or i have to type those things manually if i need to enter it myself is it supposed to read the whole thing at once or one numberoperator at a time
student,after reading many posts about stackh we are still confused on what the difference is between this file and listh do we need to call functions from listh in stackh what is the difference between the functions we need to write in listh and stackh
student,could somebody help me with this in one of my stack tests i copied the class greatern that was covered in lecture in my main function and then declared an object like this greatern g2525 g2526 is true according to my terminal but when i use it like this assertpruebacountifg25 2 where prueba is a stack of ints with 50 26 and 2 error no matching function for call to ‘stackintcountifmaingreatern’ countif worked fine with the function pointers that it encountered in the 00 test so what am i doing wrong thanks in advance
student,in the insert function can iterator point to pass by end
student,i was anticipating on q to be inputed in the tests to end the program but that is not the case how can the program anticipate the end of input and end itself in a scenario where q is not inputed to end the program
student,in the spec i should point to a valid address does it mean the list that i points to cannot be empty
student,what defines necessary i was to implement a private member variable that helps my functions
student,this made my day class fox public animal public fox foxconst string namein animalnamein virtual void talk cout endl
student,the spec says that the list class should not have any friends under the stack class description does this mean that there is no friend declaration in the private section of list or that iterator and list cant be friends i would assume it is the former
student,where should iterator point after erase or insert is called
student,the big three are listed as optional for the list and iterator class does this mean that we should not submit any test cases for the big three functions in list i am asking because i am worried that if i submit test cases for these functions i will lose points because the autograder does not have implementations for these functions
student,when i cout i in my iterator loop for task 1 in the lab it prints out the following 0x7f9481c04b00 0x7f9481c04b30 0x7f9481c04b60 0x7f9481c04b90 0x7f9481c04bc0 0x7f9481c04c00 0x7f9481c04c20 0x7f9481c04c50 0x7f9481c04c80 0x7f9481c04cb0 0x7f9481c04ce0 counting chickens and horses 9 chickens 2 horses how can this be fixed
student,hint for this function to access the private list variable you will need to declare it as a friend function in the class declaration above template typename u stdostream operatorstdostream os const stacku obj in the spec it says that list should have not have any friends but here it says to declare a friend classam i missing something or are these contradictory
student,our list tests work perfectly when we use ints and char however when we try to use rational as our type we start to get errors are we missing a step or we just cannot use rational in our tests
student,when i try to compile my listtest01cpp terminal tells me i have one error no new line at the end of the file werror wnewlineeof and theres a green arrow pointing to the curly bracket the command line that i put in is make listtest01 in listtest01cpp i end the program with couting some lines indicating that i passed all the tests and then return 0 and then the ending curly braces i have no idea where this error might be coming from so some help would be very much appreciated
student,when we use valgrind to check for memory leaks we keep getting the following errors we have tried all the suggested recommended commands to use with valgrind from previous piazza post but we cannot find our error can anyone explain what the errors mean or what should we do next
student,the animalstxt file will not open properlyi have not changed anything in main any ideas why this is happening screenshot20150410at41906pmpng
student,if we have an empty list and we create an iterator to begin the iterators nodepointer will be null then lets say i call pushfront the iterator will still be pointing to null even though there are elements in the list do we need to take care of this kind of situation or is it up to the user to worry about revalidating the iterator also what should happen if there are elements in the list and i make a begin iterator and then pushfront and then dereference the iterator should it point to the original first element or the new one
student,since iterators are supposed to behave like pointers should our overloaded assignment operator allow the user to set an iterator equal to zero like this listintiterator i i 0 since iterators are supposed to behave like pointers and pointers are sometimes initialized as null pointers as so int ptr 0
student,on stack test00cpp there is stackint stackcpymystack is it object of stack class or function name
student,im using erase to remove the first element but since its already removed so the first pointer is dangling the destructor will have an error when it runs my question is that do i need to fix this in my code or just leave it like that because i saw another post saying this is something the user should worry about
student,i am somewhat sure on these but not completely 0 0 would be 0 0 0 1 would be 0 1 0 12 would be 0 1 yes
student,im confused on when the big three are needed to be implemented specifically since the stack classs private member variable is of type list then wouldnt it be using the big three of the list class and stack would not need its own big three however does stack need its own default constructor
student,it seems like my pushfront is making my program run indefinitely i accounted a case for an empty list and included asserts in my code any pointers as to what else i should consider fixing
student,should we be calling our rational constructor in this function to ensure that the numerator and denominator or the lhs and rhs dont have a common factor greater than 1 and after we do that is it possible to just compare by saying lhs rhs or do we need to go through each arguments numerator and denominator and make sure they are equal to each other thanks
student,can we include cmath in our rationalcpp file for getting the absolute value of numbers using abs
student,the rme for this method is already given in listhstarter however it doesnt have a modifies clause even though it obviously has to modify things to insert a new element should we add a modifies clause to the rme for this method
student,i think i may have missed this point in lecture but why do we use functors instead of just creating a general function that takes in two arguments for limit and n whatever variable you are evaluating
student,for my calc executable i am getting memory leaks if i stop the program mid way using the ctrl c shortcut however there are no leaks or errors if i use ctrl d or a shell redirected file or using q as the input is this a problem i need to fix also for the inputs to calc can we assume that the inputs will always be one of the operators or ctrl d for instance what should happen if the user hits the return key without typing anything in should this exit the program too also how should we handle incorrect operation inputs
student,is it possible that you insert to empty list for example listintiterator iter mylistbegin begin null mylistinsertiter 42
student,i am trying to override the assignment operator for iterator im trying to do it similarly to the way i did list im trying to erase this and insert rhs i tried to call them by saying listterasethis and listtinsertrhs but it didnt work is my approach correct and if so whats wrong with this syntax
student,the spec comment for this function says return an iterator pointing to past the end technically wouldnt and iterator pointing to past the end and before the beginning be the same thing since they would both be null or 0 and essentially point to the little void beneath the heap in lecture the pointers for before the beginning and after the end for the doubly linked list pointed to two separate symbols making me think they are distinct in some way is there some unique distinction between those two that i am not grasping or do they point to the same place
student,in the rme for this function it says requires i is a valid dereferenceable iterator associated with this list would the iterator pointing to one before the front or one after the back be considered valid in other words would i null be considered a valid iterator should we account for deleting that thanks in advance
student,if i call the following rational 10 should i get 10 or 10
student,effects constructor for a rational number that is equivalent to numeratorindenominatorin remember to ensure the invariants rationalint numeratorin int denominatorin since the first invariant states that the denominatorin has to be 0 or greater if the user passes in 2 for example would we have to modify the denominatorin value if so what would we modify it to
student,for end in the specs it says that it should return the position one past the end so does that mean if we do for example iterator i lend i the iterator should know point to the last element of the list
student,for the erase function how do we know which mode to erase is it the node that the iterators nodeptr points to
student,will inputs be entered in all in one line that is will inputs be entered like this 2 3 2 c enter key pressed or this 2 enter key pressed 3 enter key pressed enter key pressed 2 enter key pressed enter key pressed c enter key pressed basically what im asking is if our calccpp is supposed to handle an entire line of input at a time or just one input at a time im currently using getline and delimiter stuff but im not sure if im doing it right
student,when i run my debugger i seem to seg fault in pushfront on the line where i try to assign the nodes datum value to the datum passed in as a parameterany ideas why
student,im having some trouble writing the part of insert to handle the case in which the iterator is equal to the end ive read through other similar piazza questions and the consensus seems to be that an iterator pointing to the end could be passed here and the data would just be inserted in the back but if we are inserting a node at the back we need to assign its prev pointer correct i dont see a feasible way given only the lend iterator which points past the end of the actual list to find what node the prev pointer of the inserted node should point to
student,invariant4 when denominator is 0 numerator must be 1 0 or 1 wont a denominator of 0 cause a divide by 0 error though
student,in the listh it said we can insert at a valid iterator im wondering if listend is a valid iterator can we insert at the end of a list another question after we do insert should the nodeptr points to the new node we just inserted or the original node thanks for answering my questions
student,for the iterator operator function my code currently resembles the code that was in the lecture slide for iterators however when i run the compile check it gives me an error what am i missing here
student,i am looking at the spec for project 5 for the first time tonight and realizing that i have not absorbed the last couple weeks of lecture well enough to even begin the project what lectures should i review before starting the project 17 deep copies 18 linked lists 19 templated containers 20 iterators and 21 functors are there any other lectures i should review is it a waste of my time to review all of these lectures right now thanks
student,iterator has to point specific position right so in the maincpp listintiterator i and i dont know how to create node p that points to a position
student,is there any reason why doing nodeptr nodeptrnext doesnt actually move nodeptr to the next node im running into an infinite loop when implementing the size function for this reason in the actual size function i use an iterator and the operator but that operator simply takes the basic format of the instructor given operator but instead of nodeptr nodeptrprev nodeptr nodeptrnext im working on visual studio and the compiler doesnt even seem to recognize any of the prev or next pointees even in functions already given in the listhstarter can anyone give me any tips as to why this would induce an infinite loop
student,should we write rational class test cases or can we assume that rationaltest00 does a thorough job of testing
student,we declared list as a friend class before the member functions in the class declaration but the compiler isnt letting us use list still stackh12341 error use of undeclared identifier list for typename listuiterator i listbegin i listend i stackh12360 error use of undeclared identifier list for typename listuiterator i listbegin i listend i
student,im having trouble implementing this is it possible to just make a private variable called size and incrementdecrement it in every function when the size of the list is changing if not i know there is a way to do it by traversing by pointer i just cant seem to figure it out even when following the lecture slides if you cant add private member variables or if this isnt a good way to go about doing it i probably would learn more if i traversed through the list or used the iterator could someone give a hint as to how to do this
student,im not sure if this is the place to ask this but if we have questions that are utilizing matlab can we ask in the eecs office hours if so which category should i choose in the office hours app so far the help given at the math lab has been mostly unsuccessful thank you
student,it says it deletes a single element in the list but i dont get what it is really supposed to do delete what
student,why would this line of code lastnext 0 cause a seg fault
student,in our prefix operator for list we are returning this but our chained preincrements dont work so if we tested saying list is 1 2 3 4 before i 1 after i 2 the after should be 4 not 2
student,i dont understand the relationship between bool anyofconst listint l bool predint and the functor class which has a custom constructor and overloaded function call operator that we covered in lecture how would we use that class in passing in a function as an argument
student,i notice that stackh is very similar to listh therefore what is the use of stackh can we implement in there something that we cannot implement in listh
student,just want to clarify if we have something like 20 would it be simplified to 10
student,after debugging our popfront function it behaves correctly however after executing firstprev 0 in order to reset the prev pointer of the new first element to null we get a segfault dont know whats going on here because this type of code is used throughout lecture examples
student,so i was playing around with lists and functors and polymorphism etc etc today and i ran into an issue that i dont quite understand here is a snapshot of all the significant code the error comes in my platypus class when i try to use the functor that i have defined basically visual studio is telling me that the object is a const object and that no version of the call matches for a const object when i change the function prototype to be nonconst the error goes away likewise as seen in the donkey class using a pointer for it does not cause issues can someone explain to me whats going on i dont think im modifying anything in the function so there shouldnt be any issue
student,bool operator iterator rhs const return nodeptr rhsnodeptr when we try and use this operator we get this error
student,we are getting a seg fault in our for loop declaration in pop all we are just using a node pointer that starts at first and popfronts until the pointer points to 0 for the for loop should we be using the iterator in this function
student,i just wanted to clarify something in the spec it says you must not change the public interface of the list class so we can still add private member variables and modify them in our public member functions correct
student,will we be graded on our stacktests or just the listtests
student,all my functions are working properly except multiplication i dont know why i have the symbol programmed just like the rest and my function itself is correct any suggestionssolutions
student,in the spec it says that when the input is a we should print every element followed by a space or p we should print just the first element followed by a space however in the calctest0xoutcorrect files there are no spaces after the numbers should our programs not output spaces after the last items printed
student,when i assign lastnext to 0 in popback i get a segfault and this is after i have already made a victim node pointer to hold the original last node why would assigning 0 to a pointer be a problem
student,in the rme it says we should test for the following returns a reference the top element from the stack without popping it note since a reference is returned potentially the caller can use the call to change the top without doing a poppush you should test for that in your tests isnt this function supposed to be changing the top of the list when it is called since it is pass by reference why does the rme say we need to test for that in our tests so if the caller codes listatop 4 and lista contains 1 2 3 the function is supposed to change 3 to 4 correct
student,every time i do the make listtest00 command i get an error like the one below except for every member function in the list class what does this mean for reference line 22 is the template typename t you put before the function and 23 is listt 16 is the template for the class and 17 is declaring the class
student,me and my partner are running our calculator interactively and we keep running into problems when we type in or our program is able to identify and but it just skips over and and we dont know why any suggestions as to why this might be happening ps we are running our code in xcode
student,im think that im misunderstanding something but the effects for countif in stackh says returns the number of elements in the stack for which fdatum is true so which conditions do we need to account for iseven isodd greatern lessern inrange it seems like there are so many thanks
student,what should the order of the printing be if we decided the top of the stack is the end of the list for example stackint s spush4 spush5 spush2 cout s would it print 4 5 2 or 2 5 4 thanks
student,in a copy constructor can we visit the private variables of the argument which is another instance of this class and is it true for other function apart from copy constructor thank you
student,is the calculator supposed to read in from a file using ifstream or from cin
student,requires i is a valid iterator associated with this list effects inserts datum before the element at the specified position void insertiterator i const t datum is it possible that iterator i points to null if so could iterator i points to the null before the first node if so what is the position to insert and how to tell the difference btw the two nulls the null before the list and the null after the list thanks a lot
student,hey i have been getting this error listh380 error expected constructor destructor or type conversion before token listh387 error expected constructor destructor or type conversion before list listh406 error expected constructor destructor or type conversion before list for every function that return an iterator any help thanks
student,im not quite understanding why the operator isnt working for me in lab 11 the spec says that it returns the address of the data pointed to by the node and then the compiler reapplies the operator on the returned address so the function should return an address to an animal and then the compiler dereferences the address but when i try to call something like igetname where i is some iterator it doesnt work and it throws the following error lab11cpp998 error request for member ‘talk’ in ‘ ilisttiteratoroperatoranimal’ which is of pointer type ‘animal’ maybe you meant to use ‘’ italk can someone explain to me why this doesnt work
student,i am getting this error when i try to compile stackh stacktpop compiles properly but only throws this error when called during the copy constructor does anybody know why this is the case
student,in the lab 11 spec it says note that because we use a listanimalwe are able to have a collection of both horses and chickens why why cant we do that with listanimal if youre not sure ask a neighbor or your gsi unfortunately i wont be able to make it to discussionlab this week so would someone be kind enough to explain why this is so thanks
student,hey party people im wondering about ensuring the invariants in rationalh if i recall correctlywe need to make sure that the invariants hold after a constructor runs before a deconstructor runs and before and after all member functions is this correct also i feel like it would be a bit redundant to include them after constructors that have code to insure the invariants already in example the constructor that takes in a numerator and denominator and spits out the simplified form im also unsure how i would go about checking for invariant 3 when the rational number is equivalent to an integer including 0 denominator must be 1 since my code simplifies the denominator for the constructor that takes in a numerator and denominator i feel like this would be difficult to do would i have to run some kind of test to see if its a whole number sorry for the scrambled thoughts and long text these are just all the concerns i have right now thank you in advance
student,in listh theres an insert function which states that we insert a datum to the part before i may i know what does before here means i am generally confused by the order of the list for example in a list of 1 2 3 the front is 1 the last is 3 but the next of 1 is 2 while the previous of 3 is 2 so what does before of 2 means is it 1 since 2s prev pointer will be pointing at 1 or am i getting everything wrong thanks
student,we are trying to use lists default constructor within out stack default constructor to make an empty list but we are having immense trouble doing so we figured stack listlist would work but it does not we also have tried and failed with an initializer list any suggestions
student,everything was fine and all of a sudden i got this errori deleted the file and redownloaded it but am still having the issue
student,i have written all my files and a lot of list tests and everything runs fine so far so i decided to run everything through valgrind to check for possible memory leaks i do not have any memory leaks or errors in the liststackrational test files but when i try to run valgrind on my calc program i put in some input and according to valgrind there is possibly lost memory it does not give me any line numbers of functions within calccpp or of functions that i wrote at all i do not use new or delete within calc what could the problem be here
student,should the operator on an iterator return just the value of the datum or a reference to it i want to know if it should be changeable by the user
student,if a negative value is passed in as the denominator for the rationalint a int b custom constructor should that negative sign be removed from the denominator and applied to the numerator instead
student,im wondering because if the calculator will always be tested with input routed from input files then eof can be used as an end condition for taking in input however if the calculator is also expected to take input entered directly into the command line then this wont work
student,for part 4 of the lab do any of the functions invalidate an iterator i couldnt find an instance of invalidation in the main function if you dont want to post the answer here i can come to office hours also thanks
student,if an iterator of an empty list is created is it a valid iterator are we allowed to call insert function using this iterator
student,just to make sure im getting this right if we have a fraction 24 our constructor should reduce the fraction and make it 12
student,if we have our operator overload declared as a friend function in the stack class how would we access objs list member variable
student,the rme for the top function in the stack class says note since a reference is returned potentially the caller can use the call to change the top without doing a poppush you should test for that in your tests im a bit confused as to what this means i understand that the function returns a reference which would allow the user to bypass the stack and modify the private variables but are we supposed to guard against that in our implementation if so how and is the test supposed to make sure that such guards are in place
student,we wrote our insert function and have been debugging with it at first we had an issue where insert was silently messing things up and so when the destructor ran at the end of the program it basically blew up because it was trying to pop things that didnt follow the requirements of popping we fixed that in various ways but now were having one error such as this 28496 28496 heap summary 28496 in use at exit 24 bytes in 1 blocks 28496 total heap usage 8 allocs 7 frees 192 bytes allocated 28496 28496 24 bytes in 1 blocks are definitely lost in loss record 1 of 1 28496 at 0x4a075fc operator newunsigned long vgreplacemallocc298 28496 by 0x401244 listintinsertlistintiterator int const listh188 28496 by 0x400d47 main listtest03cpp77 28496 28496 leak summary 28496 definitely lost 24 bytes in 1 blocks 28496 indirectly lost 0 bytes in 0 blocks 28496 possibly lost 0 bytes in 0 blocks 28496 still reachable 0 bytes in 0 blocks 28496 suppressed 0 bytes in 0 blocks 28496 28496 for counts of detected and suppressed errors rerun with v 28496 error summary 1 errors from 1 contexts suppressed 6 from 6 so we have a memory leak to my understanding we shouldnt be deleting anything in insert because were inserting a new node in and not touching anything else so in our code we make a new node with datum corresponding to the input then we fix up its nextprev pointers and the pointers of the surrounding nodes in the list and then exit without calling delete even though we call new to make the new node is this correct i thought that because we want to keep that new node in the list where it is on the heap we shouldnt call delete in fact when i put delete in my function it always causes a seg fault how should we go about fixing this is my way of thinking correct or no
student,the spec says we should write the default constructor destructor copy constructor and overloaded assignment operator if we find we need them should we also turn in test cases for these fxns as well or is that not going to be a criteria were graded on since some of them might be optional
student,im trying to write test cases to ensure that front and back properly return the right values but im running into issues when i try to test an empty list of type string assertstringsfront 0 this is giving the compiler problems because stringsfront will return a string and i guess you cant compare that to 0 how should i go about testing front with an empty list of strings
student,for my push front and push back i am creating temporary node in the heap memory like how professors did during the lecture it successfully adds the node and passes the tests but when i run valgrind it says that there is a memory loss where the temp is created i heard from the office hours that you are not supposed to delete temp in push front and back i am really confused right now any help
student,ive been trying to compile my code for part 1 but the compiler keeps telling me that when i initialize my iterator with the begin function i cant access the constructor listtiteratoriteratorlisttnode since its private even though list is a friend of iterator and can see all of its code what am i doing wrong here
student,i followed the description of command line prompts in the script but when i type calc to run interactively i get message no such job what is my error
student,suppose there is a function funint so is return funn a tail recursive what is difference between that and return funn n the second one is definitely not a tail recursive also how can i check if a function is tail recursive in linux by using a specific flag of g thank you

student,if we were to run our calc it looks like the calculator ends when you input q however when looking through the calc test cases none of them end with q how do we know to stop running calc if q is not pressed
student,can we use iterator in listh when we implement size function
student,not sure if im making this more complicated than it needs to be but when we erase the element from the list do we have to change the nodes to point to each other if we have a list 1 2 3 1s next points to 2 2s next points to 3 3s prev points to 2 and 2s prev points to 1 if i delete 2 1 next points to nothing and 3 prev points to nothing do i need to make 1 and 3 point at each other and if so how do we do that
student,for every function in listh we have to put template typename t before the function and listt before the name correct
student,what would happen if we down cast animal to chicken instead of animal to chicken i am just curious it should compile i think but what would happen if what is to be dynamically casted is actually not a chicken eg a horse will it crash at runtime or something automatically happens like chicken c becomes null thanks a lot
student,since listh says requires that the current element is dereferenceable how to test iterator operator we tried to create i lend and i but that clearly does not compile because end points to the null past the end so we cannot travel back from end to begin is there any good way to test this thanks a lot
student,hi i think ive noticed that a lot of the implementations that we need to do for listh for project 5 is in the lecture slides lecture 19 notes listh is this correct or am i missing something
student,cin is said to read up to the next white space but it only reads from the buffer once enternewline is pressed otherwise it just waits i think this is causing an infinite loop issue with the autograder but how would i go about fixing it i would want it to read after every single space as well as newline or tab for example 3 2 1 a does nothing unless i press enter after the a
student,i was doing lab 07 again for practice and the spec said you can save a lot of work by treating a circle as a special case of an ellipse what is the definition of a special case
student,lets say that i create an empty list then i try to traverse it with an iterator should this iterator assert or should it simply do nothing
student,i wrote a kill function which deleted the entirety of my linked list it is not my dtor function it is a separate function in a test according to valgrind this list delete method gives me an illegal read since i delete whatever my interator is pointing to then increment my iterator void kill listanimu listptr for listanimuiterator i listptrbegin i listptrend i listptrpopfront it works fine for me otherwise and i did not realize my mistake until valgrind snarled at me i will not submit this but i want to know if writing this sort of code on the test will or will not result in lost points
student,for task 2 of the lab im having trouble figuring out how to do dynamic casting i looked at the polymorphism lecture slide but im not sure how i can get the equivalent of the askuser function should i be using the readanimals function
student,can you no longer use an iterator as soon as it reaches the end one past the last node because its now null and you cant go back for instance i have a for loop that iterates through the list using an iterator that ive declared outside the loop itself and after the loop finishes the iterator is now pointing to null can i no longer use that iterator anymore thanks
student,when you push the first piece of data into a list aka the list was previously empty should the firstnext and first prev be set to 0
student,the title really says it all im a bit stuck figuring out how to pass in a function as an argument mostly in how to use it within the function itself can anybody help clear this up for me a bit
student,hello everybody i was just a bit confused on how to return things of type rational for the operation overloads my initial thought would be to simply find the new numerator and denominator and return the division of the two but that defeats the entire purpose of the class my second though would be making a new object of type rational and returning that but im hesitant because i can see that being a problem with dynamic memory anyways any help is appreciated thank you very much
student,what does this error mean error expected nestednamespecifier before namespace using namespace std for some reason its not allowing me to put using namespace std at the top of the file
student,when we try to compile our listh we get an error for our overloaded operator function that says expected constructor destructor or type conversion before token any guesses
student,how come the project specs say you can push from either end to pop you wold just remove from the same end why does it not matter what end you add or remove from thank you
student,when i am compiling on my mac from terminal not on xcode pushfront compiles fine but when i compile in caen i get the error error u2018mylistlistintfirstu2019 is used uninitialized in this function any suggestions are we supposed to create a constructor to initialize first and last
student,to insert the new node we need to declare a dynamic var of type node and initialize it doesnt that mean that the destructor would delete this node once the function is exited how do we keep the node even after the function is exited
student,do we have to check for the invariants in all of the functions or just the constructor with two ints
student,stdostream operatorstdostream os const rational obj for this overloaded operator what is the supposed to do when it is here ostream operator
student,should we be initializing the first node in the default constructor for list or should we have the nodes point to 0
student,in project 4 we had to write something at the top of every test case describing the behavior tested do we have to do this for project 5 as well
student,how come there are different typenames in stackh the given code has template typename t typename predicate and typename u why cant they all be the same
student,requires list is not empty effects returns a reference to the first element in the list t front const requires list is not empty effects returns a reference to the last element in the list t back const isnt that the first and last are already reference to the first and last element in the list why we need additional two functions to get the reference again
student,modifies this effects inserts i into the front of the list void pushfrontconst t datum in this case what is i
student,if you call the rational constructor with 10 should this be left as 10 or changed to 10
student,i am getting a compile error that says unable to match function definition with existing function declarations for my pop back pop front push back and push front functions i was wondering why i am only getting these errors for there functions or if anyone had any idea what i am doing wrong
student,if you had a nonempty list and you used copyall on it what should happen say you copied 1 2 3 onto 4 5 6 7 is that gonna throw an error or would it be 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 or 4 1 2 3 or 4 5 6 7 1 2 3
student,when i ran rationaltest00 the terminal said floating point exception and i cant find a cout statement in the test that says that so what exactly does this mean
student,i am confused about what it means for a user to be able to destroy a stack object since list is the only member variable of a stack object does this mean to destroy a stack object is to delete all the items in its list the equivalent of popping all of the elements thanks
student,so if we wanted to make a helper function for a member function of a class would we implement the helper function outside the class
student,my question is in regards to proper methods of deleting dynamic memory so as not to have leaks in lecture 19 on slide 38 of the lecture we were showed a way to avoid orphaning by popping off the gorilla then deleting it in lecture 20 on slide 68 of the lecture the slide simply showed a for loop that iterated through and deleted the dereferenced pointers i am confused as to which method to useif they are actually the same method and why the second method does not leak memory if it helps this is in regards to completing lab11 task 3
student,31 minutes into deorios 1030 am lecture he provides a factory function for intset an interface with two derived classes that actually do something this is the code static intsetsorted iss static intsetunsorted isu intset intsetfactoryconst string type if type sorted return iss return isu in the lecture he states const string type means if the user doesnt input a particular type of inset then assume they input an empty string and run the default option what is actually happening here first of all i dont understand how you are reading the reference to a string as an actual string and not a memory address but ill admit i still dont quite understand all the quirks to referencing and dereferencing secondly how does this work lets just assume that somehow type can be read as a string and not the memory address of a string which i do not understand but is obviously happening wouldnt the compiler just automatically set type to therefore making the code useless and why is this needed at all if the user doesnt input sorted the only other option would be unsorted anyway and due to the nature of the body of the function this would work even if the header was const string type i still dont understand why type needs to be read as a reference but ill admit i am obviously missing something i kinda went with the flow and let it slide the first time i watched this lecture but now its really bugging me and i cant seem to move forward i cant find anything on the internet to help either also this string is const so how are you changing it to in the first place almost everything about this is contradicting everything i think i understand about c haha
student,when i try to unit test for a iterator function and call the function ie listinterasei where i is equal to an iterator the file does not compile i get the error that it cannot call member function without object im confused about what the problem is i get a similar error with insert as well even though the operators have been overloaded and the correct things are being passed into the function
student,1 should we be testing overloaded operators 2 if so how can we go about doing this
student,why am i getting errors with the talk function with the following code animal animal for loop cout animalgetname animaltalk endl
student,im doing the lab and finished part 3 and was wondering about the valgrind output are the numbers for still reachable and suppressed okay or are we looking to make those zero too
student,im trying to overload the output operator in stackh by using this beginning of the function templatetypename u templatetypename t inline stdostream operatorstdostream os const stacku obj but i keep getting an error saying extraneous template parameter list and invalid operands to binary expression so the operator is not getting overridden correctly additionally there are many linkage warnings how would i go about fixing this
student,this is my output on valgrind im having a hard time actually figuring out what it means the empty assertion its catching is something that happens on xcode as well but as soon as i try to debug it and step through each function the code never catches it and just runs through the code like normal im esp confused about the invalid read size of 8 and what that means bash41 valgrind

student,am i correct in stating that the linked list is a memory structure that is created manually by the programmer rather than built into the language as opposed to structures like arrays which are built into the language it seems like a linked list is just a series of node structs and we create pointers to connect them and interact with them in different ways it seems like there is nothing built into the language that allows us to interact with linked lists by default
student,is walking the list in a linked list more memoryintensive than searching through an array i know that walking through a link list is described as memoryintensive in lecture and that linear search such as searching through an array grows linearly which i understand is not that slow they seem like similar tasks
student,what are the problems that could be caused by selfassignment ie the reason for checking for selfassignment at the beginning of an implementation of an overloaded assignment operator
student,hi i was wondering in project 5 why iterator begin const iterator end const and the other functions are outside the iterator class public functions
student,could we find data stored in memory that has been leaked by invoking the address operator for instance if we have a pointer to an object called node1 and then move that pointer to a new location which would cause a memory leak could we access that object again by calling node1
student,if copyall is called on a list that is not empty should it copy all of the nodes to the front of the list
student,how does testing for functions that we might have added work for example i think that in lecture we were told that the big three isnt necessary for iterators but i still implemented a copy constructor and assignment operator if i include tests for them in the listtestnncpp files would they fail automatically when paired with the buggy code simply because that code might not have implemented them also would this be a problem in terms of other functions like the big three for the list class
student,im trying this declaration of an iterator in stackh typename listtiterator i listfront and it keeps giving the error error no viable conversion from int to typename listintiterator i feel like it should be returning an address and using that to assign a new iterator using the overloaded operator in listh any ideas on how to fix this
student,i am having a hard time understanding why we need to use both a front pointer and back pointer to implement these two member functions i know that backpointer would be useful for a function like pushback and popback
student,template typename t int stacktcountifpredicate pred const code here when i do this it says predicate has not been declared how do i write the definition of this function
student,im confused as to how to overload the output operator for stackh when i declare the function as a friend in the stackh interface at the top then i get an error saying must take only one argument and when i take this declaration out then i get an error saying no match for operator should this overloaded operator be declared as a friend member function or as a nonmember function and why could i be getting these errors thanks
student,in class we are learning about how to implement linked lists and the way we have written the code in class is highly dependent on pointers i was wondering how linked lists are implemented in other languages like java or python where there may not necessarily be pointers available i could be wrong are there pointers available in all these languages that allow us to follow a similar implementation style
student,i keep getting this error does anyone know why
student,since we overloaded the operator in list does an assignment operator between two stacks automatically make a deep copy with their member lists
student,i want to know in this course can nested class access the private member variables and private member functions of its enclosing class i mean without declaring nested class as a friend of the enclosing class i heard somebody said that for c 11 nested class can access but not for c 03 how about in our course
student,when we implement the default iterator constructor by calling the custom iterator constructor inside the body of the default constructor our tests fail because calling the default constructor in the end function leads to end returning iterator pointing to the first node instead of null however when we implement the default iterator constructor using a initializer list like in the lecture slides there is no problem why is this thanks
student,i implemented iterator identically to how we implemented it in class but the compiler doesnt recognize that the operator exists for iterators and thus listh is failing the compilecheck any suggestions
student,when we try to access first inside iterator operator xcode gives an error message saying use of nonstatic data member first of list from nested type iterator
student,i know this is probably a really stupid problem but i am trying to write the size function using for loop similar to the one in class where i declare a node ptr and set it equal to the first ptr and try to have the postbody assignment be ptr ptrnext except the compiler refuses to recognize ptrnext or any node pointers member variablespointers and im just confused as to how i am supposed to access these am i forgetting something really simple when i hover my mouse over the next part of ptrnext it reads unknown listtnodenext any suggestions
student,we are trying to think of the best way to test this in our list test files we created a for loop with an iterator like in the lecture slides and then inside the for loop created another iterator object called j and assigned it to i we then asserted i j is there a better way to test this iterator operator thanks
student,did anyone not receive a submission confirmation email for their last submission for project 4 there was a problem with my final submission and i am wondering if anyone else experienced the same
student,should our test cases for listh include tests of the iterator class as well
student,should the erase function modify the iterator to point to the next element in the list
student,requires i is a valid dereferenceable iterator associated with this list modifies this may invalidate other list iterators effects removes a single element from the list container void eraseiterator i since erasing part of a list may cause other iterators to become invalid what are we supposed to do about it should we delete all other iterators when erase or insert is called
student,we have been having a hard time implementing size function we used for loop to start from first until it becomes null however it keeps on going infinite loop and it doesnt count the size of last any hint or suggestion please
student,for list testing is it worth our time to test with other types such as chars or should we assume that we will only be working with integers
student,what does positive infinity negative infinity compute to is it 0
student,one question if noninfinity undefined00 undefined however if infinityeither positive or negative undefined00
student,im getting this error stackh74 error iso c forbids declaration of ‘list’ with no type stackh74 error expected ‘’ before ‘’ token on the line where the member variable listt list is declared inside of stack but the comments say that we are not allowed to change the private section of stack
student,hi i am writing codes for my rationalcpp while i always have this problem rationalcpp146 error ‘rational rationaloperatorconst rational const rational’ must take either zero or one argument rationalcpp167 error ‘rational rationaloperatorconst rational const rational’ must take either zero or one argument rationalcpp186 error ‘rational rationaloperatorconst rational const rational’ must take either zero or one argument rationalcpp205 error ‘rational rationaloperatorconst rational const rational’ must take exactly one argument rationalcpp224 error ‘bool rationaloperatorconst rational const rational’ must take exactly one argument can anyone help me solving this thanks
student,is it considered good or approvable style to include assert functions inside your main functions not test functions as sanity checks and keep them in when your code is finalized and commpiled since the rme shouldnt allow any of these asserts to fail would it be okay to put these in all of our functions
student,does anyone know how to access the page on the autograder website where we can view the contents of past submissions
student,i was just looking at the score how many bugs are there in the playertest because i exposed 7 bugs but my score is only 5 out of 8 and if i want to look at the autograder test case to see where i got wrong do i have to go to the instructors office hours or any gsi can show the test cases to me
student,so when i try to compile stacktest00cpp i keep getting an error with the overloaded operator in file included from stacktest00cpp1 stackh129 error u2018stdostream stacktoperatorstdostream const stackuu2019 must take exactly one argument listh in member function u2018int stacktcountifpredicate const with predicate bool int t intu2019 stacktest00cpp56 instantiated from here listh77 error u2018listintnode listintlastu2019 is private stackh112 error within this context listh128 error u2018listtiteratoriteratorlisttnode with t intu2019 is private stackh112 error within this context make stacktest00 error 1 could anyone shed some light on why im getting this error i dont understand what must take exactly one argument means as the declaration given to us had two parameters in the parameter list thanks in advance
student,since the next pointer in the node should be pointing to the next node why would it make sense to set it equal to frontptr as done in lecture and in order to initialize the prev pointer to the previous node i assume how would we know which node that should be pointing to
student,t front const what does the t mean vague memory of templates maybe
student,1 what does next do in the last element in the list and prev in first element if i recall correctly in lecture we set them 0 is this true here as well 2 is it possible for a memory address to be 0 3 for stack is it possible to have multiple elements without an operator and when given an operator does that operator act on all of them for example given the possible input 4 3 2 the equivalent statement is 4 3 2
student,when you say that 10 is infinity and 10 is infinity and etc whathow are we supposed to represent this in the rational class
student,we have no memory leaks but we have other errors that were not quite sure how to fix the reason is that our code compiles on xcode and in terminal but on caen we get errors with our assert statements when running make mytests we tried to debug by stepping through the functions tested in those assert statements but we were unable to find where the error was here is a summary of our valgrind output bash41 valgrind leakcheckfull listtest01 38911 38911 conditional jump or move depends on uninitialised values 38911 at 0x400fc8 listintsize const in text was here but i deleted it 38911 by 0x400bfa main in 38911 38911 conditional jump or move depends on uninitialised values 38911 at 0x400fc8 listintsize const in 38911 by 0x400cd4 main in 38911 38911 conditional jump or move depends on uninitialised values 38911 at 0x400fc8 listintsize const in 38911 by 0x400d5b main in 38911 pass listtest01cpp 38911 38911 heap summary 38911 in use at exit 0 bytes in 0 blocks 38911 total heap usage 9 allocs 9 frees 216 bytes allocated 38911 38911 all heap blocks were freed no leaks are possible 38911 38911 for counts of detected and suppressed errors rerun with v 38911 use trackoriginsyes to see where uninitialised values come from 38911 error summary 3 errors from 3 contexts suppressed 6 from 6 bash41 valgrind leakcheckfull listtest02 39056 conditional jump or move depends on uninitialised values 39056 at 0x4011db listintpopfront in 39056 by 0x400d7b main in 39056 39056 conditional jump or move depends on uninitialised values 39056 at 0x400d86 main in 39056 39056 conditional jump or move depends on uninitialised values 39056 at 0x40133d listintpushfrontint const in 39056 by 0x400db7 main in 39056 passed listtest02cpp 39056 39056 heap summary 39056 in use at exit 0 bytes in 0 blocks 39056 total heap usage 24 allocs 24 frees 576 bytes allocated 39056 39056 all heap blocks were freed no leaks are possible 39056 39056 for counts of detected and suppressed errors rerun with v 39056 use trackoriginsyes to see where uninitialised values come from 39056 error summary 3 errors from 3 contexts suppressed 6 from 6 how can we go about fixing these errors when debugging and stepping through doesnt seem to work or show us where the errors are
student,isnt stack just a list so wouldnt the empty and size functions for stack just be returning the empty and size functions for list
student,ive been trying to fix segmentation fault with valgrind but when i valgrind it it only says pass and never stops i forcequit the valgrind then it gives me write failed broken pipe why is that
student,when doing operator a in the calculator should there be a space character between the last rational and newline
student,currently the way the iterator is setup it is only a forward iterator are we allowed to manipulate the private members of both the list and iterator classes so that we can make the iterator bidirectional this would involve actually creating a node that points past the end and making connections for it or is there a better way to make it a bidirectional iterator also if we arent making it bidirectional whats the point of making it a doubly linked list also how are we supposed to print the stack in the top to bottom order that you want us to without actually modifying stack yet doing it in on speed and o1 linear space
student,will we be given a buggy implementation of list that works properly but has terrible memory management eg all functions work as described except nothing is ever deleted and theres just a bunch of stuff on the heap and if we are going to be given something like this how could we test it do any ways of checking the heap from inside code even exist
student,if an iterator is destroyed should the node that nodeptr points to also be removed or would only nodeptr be destroyed
student,just to be clear should we not be able to use the decrement operator on an iterator that is at the end of a list since such an iterator would be one past the end thanks
student,is it possible for one of these to be pointing to 0 and the other be pointing to an actual node it says points to first or last node in list or 0 if list is empty in the h starter but im not sure if that has the strength of a requires clause
student,when i run valgrinds memory check on one of my list test cases that successfully runs with exit code 0 i get the following output 21732 heap summary 21732 in use at exit 0 bytes in 0 blocks 21732 total heap usage 200 allocs 200 frees 4800 bytes allocated 21732 21732 all heap blocks were freed no leaks are possible 21732 21732 for counts of detected and suppressed errors rerun with v 21732 error summary 101 errors from 2 contexts suppressed 6 from 6 even though valgrind says that no memory was leaked it also says that there were 101 errors should i be concerned about this when i use trackorigins valgrind says this several times 21732 uninitialised value was created by a heap allocation should this not be occurring im not sure what to make of this output thanks
student,are there no office hours today theyre on the calendar but a few of us have been here for a while and nobodys shown up
student,i notice that the code that they give in rational for operator overaloading is rational operator while in list we are suppose to give t operator the symbol is as reference however why do we need it when it comes to operator overload thanks
student,is there a way to avoid an overflow wherein the heap and stack meet for instance if you allocate a lot of memory on the heap and have a lot of stack frames it is possible for the two to meet since the first grows upwards and the second downwards im assuming we dont have to worry about this for project 5 but just out of curiosity what is a clean way to ask the os to allocate the process more memory i know you can increase the buffer size during compile time using flags but im asking about a way to do so dynamically in c something along the lines of check if free memory left 1024 bytes and only then ask os to allocate more memory
student,for stackh how would we declare a friendly operator to allow operator to get access to the list
student,i am using a for loop to run through all of the values of the stack for countif when i try to initialize my first iterator i type in listtiterator first listbegin when i run it however i am getting the following errors stackh82 error expected ‘’ before ‘first’ the previous line contains a semi colon int counter 0 what is my error
student,in our rationalcpp file one of the variants in the class is that the numerator and denominator should not have a common factor other than 1 eliminate any common factors im not sure how to go about this the only thing i can think of is to have a for loop that goes through the denominator and the numerator to see if i denominator 0 for example and then divide by that number if it does i feel like this is really inefficient and i was wondering if there is a better way to do this
student,i dont see anywhere in the spec or in any of the requires clauses that list needs to be sorted does this mean that for the erase function inside iterator i can swap the targeted element with the last or first element and then remove it with popfront or popback and for the insert function can i pushback the element at the targeted index and put the element to be inserted at this old index thanks
student,does listend return an iterator pointer to the final node of the list or a pointer to the next location of memory after the final node of the list
student,for the and iterator operators what should we be comparing datum or node pointers also how should we refer to our second comparison
student,can someone please explain what the benefit of using recursive functions is with respect to the stack
student,i could not contain my curiosity and decided to figure out iterators by myself is the function signature t operator const t operator const or is it node operator const node operator const this decision affects the test cases that i write for them
student,in order to forgo typing rhsgetvalue a million times can we simply declare these values static ints in other words static int a rhsgetvalue foo return a
student,how many types of variables do we need to write test cases for int is a given but should we also test double float char bool
student,i wonder if we can use stoi in this project or our compiler in caen does not support this function any other way to convert string to int atoi doesnt throw exception when it fails which cannot satisfy my needs
student,how do i check the invariant for class are we allowed to edit the h so that we can add the checkinvariant thanks
student,if we submit a lab late will you grade our last submit as late or will you grade the last submit that was made before the deadline
student,hello is there a survey to complete for lab 10 2321 i cant find instructions to fill out the survey in the lab directions and i cant find an email containing a survey link thanks in advance
student,if we were in the process of writing list and we just wanted to compile it to see if the general syntax of stuff was okay would we do that with g wall werror pedantic o1 listh o list ive been doing that and it hasnt been generating any output so i dont actually know if its working thanks
student,for task 1 i am trying to make the initializer list for the arrayintvector copy constructor how do i access the variables in the arrayintvector that is passed in as a parameter i tried the following arrayintvectorconst arrayintvector other capacityothercapacity numelemsothernumelems but i guess the arrow operator is not the correct thing here
student,we didnt modify pushback at all we only coded the copy constructor and the assignment operator what could be happening here
student,can we create private member variables in the list class
student,there has to be a better way than just copy and pasting it into a document
student,on the function declaration line for the copy constructor labster is yelling at me for conversion of an unknown to an int even though it asks for const arrayintvector other im very confused because this line was already provided for us
student,how do i check for self assignment
student,im a bit confused about what the input n should do for the stack in calccpp does negating the top item just mean that it is removed from the stack the example in the project 5 pdf seems to show the n command not having any effect
student,i just had a question about commenting in general for project 3 i got marked off points on readability with a comment that i should comment only on complex block of codes and not every line i dont think that this was the sole source of missing points as there was another comment however in general why would it be bad to have short comments after even small snippets of code explaining what is going on also by no means did i have a comment after every line but i did have short comments very frequently after noncomplex blocks of code for me it makes it so much easier to go back through my code and find out where certain things are happening and i cant imagine how this would affect readability in a negative way my comments may have been in front of small snippets of code just a few lines long but this should make it easier to go through the code and i cant image why this would be looked at as a bad thing can i get some instructor input on this
student,do we need to be able to tell when the list contains pointers so that the destructor can deallocate this memory or should we write our destructor for simple types
student,i was trying to finish up this lab but it looks like when it iterates through the given grow code it gives me this error whats wrong with this i have redone my code once already doublechecking by looking at the lab and the lecture slides
student,what is the meaning of primitive as in primitive member variable
student,if we submit the lab in a different time zone is it due at midnight in that time zone or midnight edt
student,im trying to examine deeply on this line of code double ptr new double30 1 creating the double with value 30 on heap 2 creating the double pointer 3 assigning the address on heap to the double pointer can i get an answer about according to compiler what the order of execution is
student,in our submission of lab10 is it necessary to uncomment testall in the main function
student,after the spec gives definitions for and it says assume that the above formulas also work when infinities and undefined values are encountered does this mean that we should not have to write conditional checks at the beginning of our overloaded operator definitions to check for 0 infinite and undefined values
student,hi im getting some linker errors when trying to run listtest00cpp can anyone help me out i implemented all the functions in the listtest00cpp so im not totally sure why its saying theyre undefined thanks
student,for now we have a static function checkinvariant which takes in a const rational and check its invariants and we call this checkinvariant function in the ctors of rational class do we keep this function or do we delete it for efficiency i knwo we dont need to worry about it in 280 thanks
student,labster doesnt recognize me and i cannot access my work for lab 10 does anyone know how to fix this
student,do we need to submit tests for the copy constructor overloaded assignment operator and destructor i dont really understand how we can write code to test these functions
student,the function definition for iterator begin gives me an error saying that it cannot access the private member first from list did i accidentally modify the code if this is not supposed to work how can i write this function to work properly without declaring a new public function that returns a pointer to the first node rather than first value
student,from lecture when using an iterator to dereference something with like iterator i cout i the overloaded function t operator const return nodeptrdatum if the operator is of return type address reference of object t why do you return the datum and not the location same question for t listfront and back they have a return type of locations to the datum so why do we only return datum and not datum why does returning an object of t return the address of that object
student,when comparing instances of rational using is infinity equal to infinity infinity equal to infinity and undefined equal to undefined or do these comparisons evaluate to false despite the numerators and denominators of each side being equal i only ask because in some math libraries things like nannan evaluate to false and require the use of an additional function such as isnan to detect
student,im a little confused about the iterator end function it says to point past the end what would we make the value of the datum in this case
student,int main listgorilla zoo zoopushfrontnew gorilla in the second line of code we pass in new gorilla does the compiler just create an object gorilla and point to it from the datum since it is equivalent to gorilla colo new gorilla zoopushfrontcolo
student,for the calculator what happens if there arent enough operands on the stack for a certain call are we to assume that there will always be enough operands or should we do error checking
student,should copyall delete the elements in list before copying or add the elements of l onto the back of the current list
student,since we did not think of this algorithm ourselves should we cite him or the webpage that we looked at wikipedia if so what is the format thanks a lot
student,i tried some code and find that a member function can call its default ctor however if a member function calls its custom ctor there is an error saying redefinition of formal parameter secretin where secretin is the int passed into that member function and of course it will be passed into the custom ctor in the body of that member function can anyone explain why this does not work also i figured out that in lab 10 i need to use an initializer list for the copy ctor which turns out to work fine but if i use an initializer list for arrayintvector operatorconst arrayintvector rhs something is wrong why are this function and the function for copy ctor considered to be member functions of the class thanks
student,hello just wondering when jay will be arriving for his office hours in 1695 bbb on the calendar it says that they were supposed to start at 430 but it is now 505 and i havent seen him here yet thank you
student,im trying to use the makefile to compile rationalcpp but when i type make rationaltest it says there is no rule to make the target ive checked the makefile multiple times to make sure this is the correct command and have also tried many similar commands to see if they worked what is going wrong
student,when i run testall on my finished code for lab10intvectorcpp labster keeps giving me a bunch of errors on the grow and print functions for pointerrelated errors i didnt modify these functions at all i only implemented the constructor and overloaded assignment operator so im confused as to why these functions are causing errors any ideas why this could be happening thanks
student,based on our definition is end a dereferenceable iterator if it is not then it cannot use operator however in the standard library list its end iterator is able to use operator
student,what is the correct output for lab10
student,when we check the invariants for the rational class for example in the constructor that takes in the numerator and denominator do we assert false if something passed in does not match the invariants or just convert the input so that it does match for example 2 and 3 becomes 2 and 3
student,will we be getting the official grading statistics on the final project 3 grade and project 4 autograder score
student,if we insert a new node before the first node of a list should we change the first member variable of that list to the new node that we just inserted however there is no way to access the list from iterator so how can we do that
student,hello how many points will the handgrading portion of project 4 be worth will it just be 6 points for readability thanks
student,hello i know that you cannot tell us exactly what the tests are because you reuse them but can you vaguely help with what blackjacktest02 entails is the difference between student and with solution that our deckcpp playcpp handcpp and cardcpp are used or not sorry i just want to know what was wrong for future reference
student,hello im a freshman majoring in computer science and im staying in ann arbor for the spring and summer im looking to pair up with some students who want to start building a project or projects once this semester is over i dont have any coding experience outside of 183 and 280 but im excited to learn more on my own if youre interested feel free to shoot me an email mereosteumichedu thanks for reading
student,for copyall in the list class should we assume that the list is already empty or do we need to clear it before we begin to copy nodes over from the other list
student,it is clearly stated at the top of the file that we should not edit rationalh yet it also includes the comment section you should add in a default constructor destructor copy constructor and overloaded assignment operator if appropriate if these operations will work correctly without defining these you can omit them a user of the class must be able to create copy assign and destroy rational numbers i cant really see a use for a destructor given the lack of dynamic memory but i can see the use for the assignment operator and maybe a copy constructor given the two statements above should we refrain from making the big 3 in rationalh
student,if iterator end is supposed to return the iterator past the last node of a list then will it always return 0 based on our design of list
student,are we able to add an ensureinvariants function to either our rationalcpp or rationalh or will this mess up the way our project graded with the autograder
student,bigthree a42 bigthree b 0 bigthree ca bigthree d a why does this run a copy constructor instead of an assignment operator cout lizard endl endl int arr 0 bigthree e new bigthree56 b e why does this not run a copy constructor c e
student,there are multiple forms that both functions mentioned in the title can take on which ones are we supposed to implement or should we implement all of them for instance the assignment operator can be any of these myclass operator const myclass rhs myclass operator myclass rhs myclass operator myclass rhs const myclass operator const myclass rhs const myclass operator myclass rhs const myclass operator myclass rhs myclass operator const myclass rhs myclass operator myclass rhs myclass operator myclass rhs
student,
student,the rme for iterator erase says may invalidate other list iterators does this mean the iterator passed into the function is also invalidated because it is passed by value instead of by reference so there is no way to not validate it so that it points to the element past the erased element unless we have to do something fancy in the copy constructor
student,so the comment within the class iterator in listhstarter says something about overloading and within the iterator class seems fairly intuitive move the iterator to the next node in the linked list but how are we supposed to overload and
student,because soulja boy
student,i keep having issues with my definition of t front const as well as t back const when i use return firstdatum i keep getting error c2440 return cannot convert from listintnode const to int is there something im missing here
student,ive read the spec over twice and have not seen any information regarding partners on this project are we allowed to work with partners on project 5
student,prof deorio said in lecture that he can briefly show us the test cases that we failed in english version not the code version during his office hours however i have lectures during both his and prof ringenbergs office hours so where can i ask for test cases can i ask for a gsi or an ia thanks a lot
student,when i run testall in the labster program im warned about a segault in my for loop while im copying data elements in the overloaded assignment operator function i changed the capacity to rhscapacity and numelements to hrsnumelements and im looping from 0 to numelements any idea why this could be happening
student,my partner and i were originally hoping to make the competitive player cheat by knowing the whole deck unfortunately we werent able to figure out how to do it because we werent given access to the currently played deck in playercpp did anyone figure out how to do something similar to this im just curious
student,to break some of the silence after project 4 here on piazza and hopefully to give a few people some smiles take a listen original source material for audio
student,i am declaring a dynamic array exactly as done in example code from the lectures and labster is telling me that it doesnt recognize the declaration solution
student,right now the pushback function looks like this void pushbackint x if numelems capacity grow datanumelems x shouldnt grow be called if numelems is capacity 1 like this void pushbackint x if numelems capacity 1 grow datanumelems x
student,today after the project was due i tested my code against my friends code and saw that we had different values for our rand value only the second time it was called so i passed the public test i believe this is because i called the rand function one more time than he did but i did not output the value or use that number based off the comparison it seems like the values are not random and are a list of integers which i am off by one i do not see this listed as something that we are warned not to do and i believe i completed the project appropriately according to the project specifications the h file simply states that int getcut effects returns a random number between 13 and 39 i imagine that this will be a problem when testing the code so please let me know any actions i can take and i would be happy fix this tiny error if this is a problem ps i am also posting this publicly on piazza in case anyone else made the same mistake
student,while reviewing dynamic memory i was looking up these two terms for extra examples however nothing comes up when i search for the big and little void even specifying them further i get no relevant results so are these actual names for these areas in memory or are they technically called something else thank you
student,i just wanted to clarify some stuff so suppose i have the program int a 1 int blahint g return g a int main int b 2 int c blahb 1is a considered a static global variable 2 are b c and g considered static local variables if so is it because b and c both live in main whereas g lives in blah 3 is there any scenario where b would be considered a global variable in the program segment
student,i just realized i did not do the post lab survey however i finished the prelab surveyactual lab on time friday of last week will i still be able to get full credit for the lab even for doing the postlab survey a bit late
student,ill just leave this here for you to digest class foo fooey should compile but doesnt int getnum apparently it doesnt like no spaces between int and int main optionally int mainvoid exactly one of these next two lines should compile depending on whether were using c11 or not unfortunately neither of them do int nullptr 0 int lol nullptr delete 0 lol oops something went wrong should be compile error i wonder if this is defined cout cplusplus endl and one more class foo private foo void fooey const void bar cant define member functions outside the class void foobar int main lol these two lines compile foo f ffooey this should compile if everything was public but doesnt foofooey
student,i completed task 1 of lab 10 the copy constructor but the task 1 test wont run fully when i get to vec2pushback3 labster tells me i dont think youre supposed to do arithmetic with that pointer its not pointing to an array any ideas as to whats happening what i did with the copy constructor was basically what we did in lecture 16 thanks
student,my partner and i both submitted a final tar file to the autograder for project 4 i submitted the correct most uptodate file and my partner submitted a tar file from an old project which was obviously missing all of the files for this project and didnt run in the autograder he submitted the bad file after i submitted the good file and the submission period closed if the most recent submission was the wrong file from an old project is that submission counted even though we turned in the right one and got full points previously
student,so i accidentally put my uniqname and my full name in my grouptxt file which prompted this result from the autograder there was a problem with your grouptxt file you appear to have listed more than 2 uniqnames in grouptxt and it was too late for me to fix it and resubmit it before the deadline and i wasnt able to see any other feedback does that mean i get a 0 on the project
student,are we getting immediate feedback like we did project 3
student,as long as were queued on the autograder before 1155 were okay right because of course everyone is submitting right now
student,are we allowed to use other include headers than the ones listed in the spec in our test cases
student,in xcode i was able to successfully match the sample output but the code is different in caen any reason this might be happening for example the player ends with 95 in his bankroll instead of 105 and a few of the cards are off by one line again it matched perfectly in xcode
student,weve got our code almost completely finished except for one problem for some reason in the example correct output when a dealer is dealt an ace as the first card its value seems to register as 1 but in our output its an 11 like it seems like it should be is it possible to reduce the value of a soft hand once the dealer sees that he is going to bust how do i go about doing this
student,example class triangle private int a b c public triangleint a int b int c aa bb cc cout triangle endl class isosceles public triangle isoscelesint a int b trainglea a b cout isosceles endl class equilateral public isosceles equilateralint a isoscelesa a cout isosceles endl int main isosceles is23 equilateral eq4 for this example what order do things run from lecture i gathered it does this 1initializer list from isosceles 2initializer list from triangle 3 triangle constructor 4 isosceles constructor 1 initializer list from equilateral 2initializer list from isosceles 3initializer list from triangle 4 triangle constructor 5 isosceles constructor 6 equilateral constructor what if equilateral was changed to this class equilateral public isosceles equilateralint a trianglea a a would then when you initialize equilateral it goes from the initializer list of equilateral to the initializer list of triangle then to the triangle isosceles equilateral constructor
student,im getting a seg fault error after the return statement in blackjackcpp from going through gdb i think its in the string destructor i have no idea what is causing it the program runs and outputs correct all the way through
student,i was checking my output and ran over this dilemma in the spec it reads if player hasnt busted play the dealers hand the dealer must hit until reaching 17 or busting does this mean that if handvalue 17 or handvalue 21 then hand ends there or does it mean handvalue 17 or handvalue 21 then the hand ends there please let me know as soon as possible it would be an easy fix sorry for any inconvenience thank you
student,should we delete all test cases that are not decktestxxcpp and playertestxxcpp from our current directory folder when we create the make tar
student,if i run the blackjack with abnormal bankroll and hands like blackjack 1 324 simple what will the output be
student,my partner and i have made a ton of test cases but it makes the autograder take a really long time 3 or 4 minutes is that something we should be worried about is there a hard time limit for the autograder to run
student,if we have made around like 70 lines of test cases for one file would it be okay if we created multiple files of test cases with the same code and just commented out certain asserts to make sure each assert has its own file would this be an okay way to distribute the risk of a test being bad
student,are test cases graded for style what others
student,in our playertestxxcpp files is it okay to use assert statements for handcpp functions for example i frequently use the handvalue function in assert statements to check that the hand value is what its supposed to be is this alright or should the assert statements solely check for playercpp functions
student,why are 3 2 behaviors make up 7 files
student,what is the difference between blackjacktest00student and blackjacktest00withsolutionclasses i am passing the 2nd one but not the 1st one
student,i was wondering if we were supposed to make bankroll an int or double since we have to multiply it by 32 if the player gets a natural blackjack
student,blackjacktest00student 11 blackjacktest00withsolutionclasses 01 does this mean my blackjackcpp file is correct or incorrect and if blackjackcpp is incorrect how did i pass the blackjacktest00student or does this mean my file only works with my h files and i must have edited one of them accidently
student,should counting players draw function use the expose
student,my competitorplayer is derived from the counting player i have my countingplayer ctor implemented like so countingplayercountingplayer count00 and my competitorplayer default ctor is implemented like this competitorplayercompetitorplayer shouldnt that competitor ctor activate the counting player ctor im getting an error that states in function competitorplayercompetitorplayer playercpptext0x26 undefined reference to vtable for competitorplayer
student,hi im having an issue with calling the functions from the simple player inside the blackjack function when i call them it doesnt even enter the function or return anything from it the drawcpp functions work great however so im confused i didnt see any other posts about this so any help would be appreciated
student,could someone clarify if were supposed to print the player total when the player busts eg players total is 22 player busts 1997 and 2579 are giving different answers one from an instructor and the other endorsed by an instructor
student,will the player functions that we are trying to test expose the dealers upcard in the draw function or should we expose the dealers upcard in our test cases
student,in the spec it says when testing to give at most a 3 sentence explanation of what the test is trying to accomplish should this be at the top of each testcpp or include a txt overview list of what each testcpp is doing thanks
student,ive just realized that i do not call hands discardall function in any of my files my playerdealer hands in the blackjackcpp driver are local variables so i do not end up calling discardall on them is this something i should be worried about
student,can we do things in our driver that are specific to our competitor
student,what does the blackjacktest00withsolutionclasses test ive double checked to make sure that my card operator doesnt output a newline and my code works with the regular public test so i have no idea what to look for
student,in one of my player tests i created a hand and called addcard on that hand i received the error error request for member addcard in hand5 which is of nonclass type hand are we not allowed to use functions from carddeckhand i have been using the card constructor just fine but this function wont work any tips would be appreciated thanks in advance
student,i feel like the whole point of counting cards is to be better than someone who does not but my counting player plays worse than my simple at many different number of hands my code has passed the diff output provided and the autograder but im still wondering is this incorrect
student,if the player continued to hit after their two cards are dealt should it print the dealers hole card before she begins to hit ie is this correct output player bets 5 player dealt two of hearts dealer dealt eight of hearts player dealt six of clubs player dealt four of diamonds player dealt two of clubs player dealt queen of spades or should the hole card have been printed before the player plays
student,my blackjackcpp file was not separated into functions and is instead just a block of code in main this prevents me from adding rme for this file since there are no functions to annotate will i lose style points for this
student,can i print to cout in my tests that i submit
student,if the dealer gets a natural 21 after the player doesnt do we announce it
student,when i submit to the autograder my playertest01 thru playertest05 all fail to compile but when im using an ssh connection they compile and run all the way through and pass the tests all five of these tests test the bet function for the counting player that is all they have in common has anyone run into a similar problem or does anyone know how to fix this
student,
student,if the dealer busts should we still print the output dealers total is i would think not since we dont do this if the player busts but the correct blackjack output given to us in the starter files prints both dealers total is 22 and dealer busts for hand 2
student,should our test cases cover test cases that would never happen in a real game of black jack for instance if you already have a king and an ace in a black jack game you wouldnt draw however should we write our addcard function to be able to handle a case where the player draws again
student,is expose only called if the dealer exposes his cards does the counting player only count the dealers cards or also his own cards also for the draw function is the upcard always the first card drawn for the dealer
student,when the spec says that the competitor must take a different strategy does that mean that the competitor must play each hand differently or could our competitor play basic strategy like the counting and simple player but use a different counting system for instance
student,do we need to write test cases for constructors
student,i tried to initialize my private int count variable to 0 when a player was first created this worked in visual but when i shipped it over to linux i got this error error iso c forbids initialization of member count error making count static error iso c forbids inclass initialization of a nonconst static member count why cant i do this
student,should we keep our competitor player from overflowing the bankroll into negatives
student,er i know it said on the spec that each file should represent a test case does that mean we should just have one test case is represented by one assert like in each file only have one assert or can we have more than one assert
student,is it always the most recent card the dealer has received
student,we cut seven times whenever we shuffle correct thank you
student,im trying to compile my simple player and i keep getting this error playercpp in member function ‘virtual bool simpledrawcard const hand’ playercpp542 error control reaches end of nonvoid function werrorreturntype cc1plus all warnings being treated as errors now i know this isnt possible because i already ensured that it cant exit the function without hitting one of the three branches namely if soft true do something else if soft false do something else assertfalse its saying that the error is occurring after that last else assert statement so im not sure what else it wants me to add to that
student,when you define an interface with a pure virtual function such as virtual int betint bankroll int minimum 0 and then later override that function in a derived class is it necessary to include the virtual keyword so is this fine int betint bankroll int minimum or does it need to be virtual int betint bankroll int minimum
student,if the counting player has 8 the minimum bet is 5 and count is 3 what should they bet 5 or 8
student,some coding humor to brighten up everyones day since the project is due today in c14 you just write auto autoauto auto auto the compiler infers the rest from context
student,is there supposed to be a specific name for each of the derived classes i couldnt find it in the specs and i wasnt sure how else i am supposed to make an instance of the counting player in my tests that will work with your code
student,after valgrind and gdbing i found out that my simpleplayer shuffled function is setting the player pointer that i declared in blackjack to null or 0x0 i have it as virtual and open brackets with nothing inside i also did this for expose why is it resetting it how could i fix it
student,should we name the tests we perform on simple and competitor something different than playertestnncpp so the final file doesnt include them or is it okay to just add them to our list of playertestnncpp
student,why does decktest00cpp have include cardh it includes deckh which already has include cardh in it wouldnt you be including it twice then decktest00cpp does compile with just deckh included in the caen environment am i missing something or does this not make a difference
student,if i made the minimum bet 5 but the counting player only had a bankroll of 3 he would bet all 3 of his bankroll right moreover he would still bet all 5 in his bankroll if his count was 2 or over too
student,just out of curiosity what is the advantage to declaring a function static why not just keep it as a regular function is it a memory usage issue
student,what should the driver program do if a command line argument of bankroll 5 is passed through what should the driver program do if hands 0
student,my simple class is doing exactly the same thing as my counting class i am deriving my counting from simple with syntax like this class countingplayer public simple player private int count public initial constructor other functions right now i have a private member variable called count that i initialize in my initial constructor is this the correct way to derive the countingplayer from the simpleplayer i was sure to use add virtual when overriding functions it seems that bet and expose never get used because the countingplayer always bets 5
student,in player addcard if the dealer is showing an ace as the up card the player looking at the dealers up card would assume its value to be 11 since that would be the best hand correct or would the player looking at the up card assume its value is 1
student,do we need any tests for simple player if we have them will that be counted against us
student,my partner and i made a competitor that is slightly better than counting player but the changes we made arent apparent until 20 hands have been played is this ok or should we make competitor more different from counting player
student,for those of us who are still struggling take heart you can do it listen to this to help relax httpswwwyoutubecomwatchvylo7tcdbvra
student,im returning a pointer to my simple player and get an error that says my simple player cant be cast to its private base class why could this be
student,if the player is dealt two aces the total should be 12 but if the player is dealt a 10 after that how do we tell the program to put the other ace to a one so the hand total is 12 if we only have one soft variable
student,will the dealer continue to hit until his hand reaches a value of 17 or greater if it is already greater than the value of the players hand
student,this is probably a really simple question but how do i declare a player in playertestxxcpp if i type in player p1 i get a compile error stating that no type named simple exists ive made sure to include all relevant files do i need to make a char array and use the playerfactory function every time
student,suppose the dealer has an ace and a seven this could be a total of 18 which is above the seventeen cutoff over 8 which is below would he hit again or would the hand end there
student,does it matter where in the playercpp file that we declare the three static global instances of each player because i am declaring it at the top after my include statements but the variables arent found in my factory function
student,is all reset supposed to do is reset the pointer to the beginning of cards as in if we have deck d dshuffle1 dreset card first ddeal would first be the two of spades or three of spades
student,this was the first project i decided to do in xcode i compiled everything locally and submitted it to the autograder and received full credit 2626 would it be recommended that i do it again in caen or does the autograder score ensure that ill be fine
student,if we got blackjacktest00correct to work what more else can i do to test that my code is working im concerned about the counting player and all that
student,ive looked this up and seen a few unhelpful answers so im going to ask during the game we are supposed to check if there are less than 20 cards remaining and reshuffle the deck if so if the number of cards is less than 20 do we open a new pack and shuffle it or do we restore the deck back into the order it was at the end of the last shuffle and continue shuffling it if its the latter in what case would we use deckreset
student,so when i run all my test cases using makefile commands in the terminal they compile fine and run fine but when i submit to the autogravder its telling me that a bunch are failing to compile is there any reason why test cases wouldnt compile in the autograder test case blackjacktest00student failed to compile blackjacktest00student 01 test case blackjacktest00withsolutionclasses failed to compile blackjacktest00withsolutionclasses 01 compiling student test cases student test decktest03cpp compiled successfully student test decktest00cpp compiled successfully student test decktest05cpp compiled successfully student test decktest06cpp compiled successfully student test decktest04cpp compiled successfully student test decktest07cpp compiled successfully student test decktest01cpp compiled successfully student test decktest02cpp compiled successfully student test decktest08cpp compiled successfully student test playertest01cpp failed to compile student test playertest00cpp failed to compile student test playertest02cpp failed to compile
student,getting this compiler error undefined symbols for architecture x8664 vtable for competitor referenced from player3 in playerb4eb4do note a missing vtable usually means the first noninline virtual member function has no definition vtable for simple referenced from player1 in playerb4eb4do note a missing vtable usually means the first noninline virtual member function has no definition vtable for counting referenced from player2 in playerb4eb4do note a missing vtable usually means the first noninline virtual member function has no definition ld symbols not found for architecture x8664 clang error linker command failed with exit code 1 use v to see invocation make playertest00 error 1 i think it has to do with where i am implementing my functions and which function declarations are in my derived classes for example my simple inherits all of players functions counting inherits all of simples functions i implemented bet expose and shuffled in the class declaration and then declared draw again although it was implemented in my simple class is that alright
student,why cant a constructor be declared virtual playercpp7612 error constructor cannot be declared virtual virtual counting
student,i know in lecture going over the intset factory function we discussed how using static global variables is not a good technique and we avoided that problem by learning about dynamic memory for the player factory function are we supposed to use 3 static global variables i used dynamic memory but the spec said that is strongly discouraged if anyone knows id appreciate it thank you
student,so we coded project04 in xcode and everything works fine but when i went to submit to caen i got this error program received signal sigsegv segmentation fault i debugged with gdb and it occured when i tried to execute this line of code bool isnat21 false anyone know whats going on here
student,when i try compiling my playertestxxcpp i keep getting tons of errors like the following playercpptextzn6simple4drawe4cardrk4handsimpledrawcard hand const0x28 undefined reference to handhandvalue const and playertest00cpptext0x2ec undefined reference to handhandvalue const i dont get these errors when compiling blackjackcpp and such and ive checked to make sure everything is include correctly and all the definitions match the declarations so im pretty confused as to what is causing these errors any help appreciated
student,same as the title
student,sdfgsdfg so im a little confused about this valgrind output that told us we have a segfault at line 151 in our blackjackcpp we went to see what line was causing the segfault and the code was int bankroll atoiargv1 we included cstdlib does anyone have an idea of what could be going on here thanks w
student,are we allowed to use try and catch for the test cases as long as we return the proper integer values just wanted to know before we started to write more cases thanks
student,so if im interpreting the spec correctly if the player is dealt a natural 21 it doesnt even give the dealer a chance to get 21 as well nor does it output his totals or his hole card should we do the same thing if a person gets a regular 21 from more than 2 cards or if the 21 is not natural should the dealer have a shot to play as well
student,i have spent several hours on this and would appreciate any help when i run blackjack with a bankroll of at least a couple hundred the game outputs correctly for many hands until the bankroll inexplicably jumps down to 7 its always 7 i have no idea why ive set a conditional breakpoint on a hand number that i know this occurs at i start at this line in my code bankroll 3 bet 2 and i can see that before this line is executed my bankroll is at 60 then immediately after that line is executed my bankroll is 7 i am completely baffled as to what could cause this any ideas thanks
student,if i want to access count in competitor i need to make a getter and setter function in the counting player class would that have to be static like static type classnamegetter
student,i get the below when i enter runmytestspy any ideas on what this error is is it even an error
student,for the simple player the specs only say that the simple player always bets the minimum so is it possible for players to bet more than is in their bankroll same with the counting player if the count less than 2 the counting player bets the minimum but what if the bankroll is lower than the minimum
student,my program starts repeating cards used after exactly 39 hands like this player dealt seven of clubs dealer dealt nine of diamonds player dealt seven of clubs and then after 49 hands it always segfaults it should never be dealing past the end of the deck because i shuffle when i have less than 20 cards and my overloaded operator is testing correctly are 39 or 49 hands significant in any way
student,can i make a competitor that asks a person to play by reading the bet and whether to hit or pass by using cin
student,should our helper functions be static
student,i know this would ever happen but just for testing cases if you were to add an ace a ten then another ace would the hand value be 12 or 22
student,do we need to check if the cards dealt goes past 52 cards if so should it return a negative value or an error messageseg fault
student,just as it says in the title the file is compiling when i use make but when i try to do blackjack 100 5 simple or even adding the blackjackout i dont get any output help
student,my output for the blackjack 100 3 simple blackjackout is shown to identical to blackjacktest00outcorrect when using the diff w command ie ignoring whitespace but every line is shown without the diff command then when i open the files with vim the correct file was listed as containing 40 extra characters one for each line however when showing extra characters using set list the line terminations were identical any ideas about what could be causing this
student,is there a difference between endl and n
student,when i submit my code to the autograder it says my playertest00cpp failed to compile but i have no problems compiling it and running it in the terminal my test is very straight forward theres nothing tricky going on i dont know while the autograder wont compile it
student,im using a helper function as ive implemented my shuffle algorithm recursively but i cant seem to bring it into scope of the deck class since the helper function isnt declared in the header file i try to bring it into scope by using deckdeck in the parameter list any ideas
student,can someone please explain the meaning behind blackjacktest00student 01 blackjacktest00withsolutionclasses 01 i take it the first test is supplied by us but not sure what the second one means
student,i meet on problem when i want to test the performance of expose the result of expose is changing the count which is a private variable which means that i have no access of the behavior of expose
student,i read on one of the other post that we only need to submit test cases for counting however we submitted test cases for simple counting and competitor is that okay or should we go back and submit only the test cases that test counting
student,im trying to compile with g so i can use valgrind and when i enter g g blackjackcpp im getting a ton of undefined references to different functions that i call in the driver does anybody know what this means thanks
student,this is more of a question of my sanity than anything else the spec states that the final output is supposed to be cout player has bankroll after thishand­1 handsn now upon diffing the output of my project and that of blackjacktest00outcorrect i was told that i had an extra line at the end of my output i suspect somehow an extra line was taken out of my local blackjacktest00outcorrect can i get a confirmation that an extra line is supposed to be printed at the end of output as the spec states
student,we created a test case for deck and it is passing through it correctly but it is saying segmentation fault at the end output card nine of clubs correct card nine of clubs pass segmentation fault what could be happening
student,should we be submitting test cases for counting player that test general functionality behavior when playing blackjack or will our test cases only be used against code that tests betting behavior which is specific to the counting player class i understand that we should test the functionality of the player class anyway and i already wrote a lot of tests for the simple player class my question is only referring to the individual test cases that we have to submit
student,do we need to have one
student,i have found that when i give my player either counting or simple a bankroll of 152 or anything greater the bankroll is always eventually miscalculated to be 7 what i mean is all the hands are being played correctly and the bankroll is always correctly calculated but then something happens after many hands where the bankroll will jump from whatever number its at 50 for example and then it will always jump down to 7 is anyone else having a similar error if anyone has any idea as to what could cause this please let me know thanks
student,i was looking over my project and realized i only used reset in my deck constructor was that all we needed it for
student,hi some of my implementations in playercpp contain only selectional statements when i try to compile i get an error saying that control reaches end of nonvoid function etc etc for example the player playerfactory function has no return statement after the last if statement what should i do to resolve this i cant just return a random player can i
student,is there a way i can compare the output im getting vs the correct one side by side like maybe outputting to a file the diff thing is a little confusing
student,since assert returns a non zero value and the end of the main function returns 0 we can use assert statements to take care of sending the appropriate value for our test cases right
student,if the player decides to hit are we meant to print anything when the player receives his new cards ie player dealt jack of clubs
student,do we include playercpp in our test cases as well as the header file since the derived classes arent defined in header
student,do we need to provide rmes for member functions in derived classes that are modified from those in the player base class
student,i just figured out that no matter how much you shuffled the deck the first card is always two spades right
student,do we need to test all the functions in deck and player how can i test this in deck int deckcardsremaining const
student,if we need to use the counting constructor for the inherited competitor class should the counting constructor be defined as publicprotected
student,is there a suggested number of test file for this project
student,i have written a test days ago and i add aces again and again until the soft value is larger than 22ie 11 1 1 1 until the sum is 22 and in my opinion the value then will be 12 2210 since the first ace added in this hand is served as 11 but i just wonder if such kinds of test files will be serve as buggy file since it wont happen in real game according to the hit rule player will stand at 21 and we dont have so much ace in fact
student,if my competitor class is a subclass of counting should i use countingcount to access the variable keeping track of the count or is there a better way of accessing the variable i only need to access the variables value not change its value
student,if wager 0 then there would be no point in playing the hand just wondering how the output should look
student,just to clarify if a player had a bankroll of 100 placed a minimum wager of 5 and was then dealt a natural 21 should hisher bankroll increase to 102 100 5 7 or to 107 100 7
student,i describe what the test tests for at the top of each test case does this suffice for an rme
student,i read through a lot of posts but found a lot of contradictory information just to clarify if you have two aces in your hand one worth 11 and one worth 1 your hand is soft right your hand is only hard when there are no aces worth 11
student,all of my code compiles and runs successfully on the caen computers but for some reason when i submit online to the project 4 autograder my player tests always fail to compile i was wondering what could be causing this issue and how can i fix this im a little confused because i thought the autograder compiles the code the same way the caen computers do thanks in advance for your help
student,should we be doing this even through you gave us the function let me know
student,how can the dealer bust he only gets two cards right
student,i run game simulations with a bankroll of 10000 and a maximum of 1000000 hands simple lasts almost 64 thousand hands and counting lasts just under 60 thousand hands shouldnt counting outperform simple does this mean my code is incorrect or does betting big when the deck is hot not necessarily mean better performance over the long run
student,for my factory function i am trying to make static instances of player for the factory function to point to but i am getting an error message that all of my classes are abstract classes what are some common reasons for this not sure what the problem could be
student,for testing in our test files if we decided to do several assert statements does that mean we shouldnt put return 0 at the end of int main
student,if we have dealt 52 cards from the deck should we make sure cardsremaining returns 0
student,sorry if this was asked already there are a lot of posts so it was hard to check but how ridiculous could the bugs that our test files are testing be for example if the player has a hard count and his hand totals 11 or less he hits so lets say we want one of our playertestnncpp files to test this is it necessary that we test every single hand value 11 or less to make sure he hits the only reason i can see it being necessary would be if the buggy file was coded to specifically mess up when the hand value equals something specific like 3 so my question is are there going to be bugs like this that we have to catch or will it mostly be common mistakesthings that could reasonably be unintentional obviously in the example i gave we could test it all fairly easy using a loop but there are other places where we would have to test many combinations of dealer up cards and hand values to catch bugs like this is there an easier way to catch these bugs that im missing furthermore ignoring the actual game and looking at the requirements for hand and player it is possible for a hand value to be over 21 and if we call playerdraw it should return false however since for this part of the grade we are only testing playercpp and not the game is it reasonable for this to happen and again could there be a bug where it works fine for everything except when hand value 57 then it returns true for some reason i am assuming these kind of bugs wont be tested but i wanted to make sure
student,when i run make mytests the only tests run are deck tests a is this supposed to happen if not how can i resolve it b how can i test the rest of my test cases in batch thanks
student,every time i try compiling playertest00 or any other test i get this error error unknown type name countingplayer i realize that this is because countingplayer isnt declared in playerh but instead in playercpp so when i include playerh in playertest00cpp it doesnt know that my subclasses simpleplayer countingplayer and competitorplayer exist but isnt that how were supposed to code this arent we supposed to put the subclass declarations and definitions all in playercpp i thought that maybe i should put include playercpp in playertest00cpp so that the compiler would know about the subclasses but when i compiled it i got an enormous error i also remember the professor deorio saying we should never include a cpp file so im at a loss any help is greatly appreciated thanks
student,if our function implementations in our cpp files are correct
student,is the last argument of argv given as a string or cstring
student,if one test case report bug for a correct cpp file say deckcpp will it be used for testing playercpp or it is just thrown away and cant test any other cpp
student,hello i was wondering if well need to make test cases to test for the player factory function in addition to the test case already given to us or is the one given to us enough since i cant think of any other ways to test this function thanks
student,is the constructor for a hand simply the discardall function ie we should initialize the hands value and soft member variables in discardall when i try to compile blackjackcpp i get the following error so im trying to figure out if im implementing hand correctly thank you blackjackcpptext0x64 undefined reference to handhand blackjackcpptext0x6e undefined reference to handhand
student,i have python installed and i run the same command as noted in the spec but it just tells me out of 0 tests run 0 tests passed 0 tests failed can anyone explain why running it on caen is fine but not on windows
student,i have one question about separating test cases what i want to do is to separate test case such that each test case can test only one function but the problem is that sometimes we have to use other functions form that class if that function has bug then our test case will have wrong result for example if decktest01cpp is to test deck i also use deal if the sample deckcpp has a correct deck but have wrong deal then i will report wrong for that correct deck which is what i dont want so is the only way to solve this problem is to put all test case for deckcpp into one test casei really dont want to do so
student,so in the spec it says to reshuffle if the number of cards left in the deck is left than 20 does this mean reset the deck so make it a newly opened deck again and then cut and shuffle seven times
student,for example the simple player doesnt do anything for expose or shuffled but i still have to declare these in the simple class correct what should i write in their implementations so they do nothing thanks in advance
student,are we allowed to use the function given in player factory test exposeandcheckplayerbet in our other test cases for player
student,one question about constructor can we use constructor like this card card52 for int ii 0 ii 52 ii cardii card i mean even though a constructor have no return value but we still try to use it as if it has a return value thanks
student,im a bit confused on splitting up the test cases based on behaviors for example should we split up tests for bets when count 1 and when count 1 into separate test case files since theyre different behaviors of the counting player or can we just keep them all in one file splitting them up seems fairly tedious since the behaviors are quite similar and involve very similar setups
student,i was thinking about the specifications and i was a little unclear about how the counting player is supposed to work so there is of course the expose function that will allow him to keep count does the draw function do anything with count like when the draw function is called the player gets to see his hand should i add his hand to the count or do i just call the expose function when his hand is delt thank you in advanced
student,i have accidentally wrote test cases for simple player i have read somewhere on piazza that we might lose marks if we submit test cases for player type competitor is it okay if i submit my test cases for simple player as well even if it is not required
student,if a derived class is going to use one of the same functions as its parent class we dont have to include it in the derived class since it inherited right
student,i sent my project to autograder and these two tests failed as they didnt compile test case results cardtest00 11 decktest00 11 test case playerfactorytest failed to compile playerfactorytest 01 test case blackjacktest00student failed to compile blackjacktest00student 01 blackjacktest00withsolutionclasses 11 i have included playerh cstring cassert iostream and cstdlib and i passed the test on caen is there anyone having ideas on this problem thank you so much
student,quick question that seems to not be covered in the specs when the dealer and player tie a push what should be the output do we output push or some other variation or nothing at all thanks in advance
student,the spec says that when there are more face cards than lownumbered cards the deck is favorable to the player and that the converse is also true so when implementing functions that check if count is 2 or greater should we also check if the count is 2 or lower
student,ive reread through previous piazza posts about this and im a little confused as to when and why you need a constructor i understand that you dont need one in simple and that you do need one in counting but what if my competitor is derived again from player and does not include any new member variables or functions do i still not need a constructor if not how does the compiler know when i want a simple player and when i want a competitor
student,are ifdealerrank 4 5 6 and ifdealerrank 4 dealerrank 5 dealerrank 6 equivalent
student,do we need to write any test cases for what player bets when minimum is less than 5 should we test when the minimum is 0 for example or because we know that the minimum will always be at least five do we not have to worry about it
student,in blackjackcpp does it matter if we pass values into static functions by pointer or by reference
student,is it smart and allowed to implement a getcount function in counting player so that competitor player can access the private member variable count of counting player is there a better way to enable competitor player access to count
student,just to confirm i can include handh in my playertestcpp files
student,do magic numbers matter in our test cases
student,having trouble keeping track of the count for the counting player when i have the line int count 0 in the counting player class it compiles in xcode but caen sends back playercpp65 error iso c forbids initialization of member ‘count’ but when i add the word static to it xcode says nonconst static data member must be initialized out of line not sure what to do here to keep track of count
student,some of our deck tests compile in autograder and some dont the ones that dont compile have similar functions and outputs as the ones that do is there any reason why some would compile over others before we split them up into their own files we had them all together in one and that compiled and we didnt change anything by splitting it up
student,i dont get why one of the strategies for soft count of a counting player is like this if the players hand totals 18 he stands if the dealer shows a 2 7 or 8 otherwise he hits why these three numbers 2 7 8 are significant thank you
student,the spec says for this project you are required to write describe and submit individual focused test cases for your deck and counting player dose it mean that we only need to write test cases for counting player no test needed for simple and competitor
student,im trying to test a simple player and its draw function the draw function requires a hand passed in as a parameter if i already created a pointer to the player through the player factory how do i access its hand
student,can we use exposeandcheckplayerbet in our test cases this is the function given to us in the sample player test
student,do we need to take steps to guarantee the right arguments are passed in to our blackjack file for example just running blackjack leads to a seg fault for our code
student,what should we output if the player is dealt a natural 21 specifically what do we print after player dealt natural 21n do we print players total is 21n followed by player wins or we just add 32 of hisher bet and move on to the next hand ive read the spec which says if the player is not dealt a natural 21 have the player play hisher hand if neither the dealer nor the player bust compare the totals and announce the outcome add to the bankroll subtract from it or leave it unchanged as appropriate however it does not make it very clear which situation a natural 21 fits into thanks a lot
student,in messing around with different strategies for competitor i decided to make competitor a derived class of counting for some reason however it will not inherit the expose or shuffled functions does anyone have any idea why this might be the case
student,i am using gdb but for some reason it doesnt take into account the inputs for argv how would you structure your commands while running gdb so that it actually got vallues for the argvargc input
student,we derive our competitor from the counting player however for some reason expose wont work unless we write it again into competitor we know were not supposed to do this but our test cases and blackjackcpp will not work otherwise is there something we could be doing incorrectly that would make this happen
student,playertest00cpp complies and passes on caen however it fails to compile on the autograder can someone please tell me why this is happening thanks
student,i am getting errors in my playertestcpp when i call shuffled and bet it is saying that it using an undeclared identifier how do i fix this
student,can someone help me clarify some questions regarding our test files 1 in the spec it is required to list specific behavior that the implementation must exhibit in at most three sentences what does it mean can someone give me an example on how to write this 2 it seems that we are encouraged to write unit tests for each function and split them into different test files but can we test cardsremaining without calling deal or test deck reset without calling shuffling thank you
student,in our implementation of cardcpp to help out with the ostream function that prints the card we added these two arrays taken from euchre at the top of cardcpp const char const suitnames spades hearts clubs diamonds const char const ranknames two three four five six seven eight nine ten jack queen king ace this was to help us be able to print the correct output however do we need to find another way to do this or is this something that the correct solution classes would have as well
student,when i declare my simpleplayer countingplayer and competitorplayer classes through syntax like this class simpleplayer public player code i get the errors class does not name a type and simpleplayer does not name a type any advice on where i am going wrong thanks in advance
student,im getting confused on how to implement the derived functions in counting so like for draw our code for the countingdrawcard c hand player just callsreturns the corresponding simpledraw function is this correct or is this in itself redundant
student,can someone answer 2338 please
student,we have one player test solely dedicated to testing the functions we implemented in handcpp this was to make sure our hand class was correct however if we include this in our tests we submit to the autograder will we lose points
student,for our test cases is it alright to be testing one function per test case for example deck has 5 functions so we have 5 test cases each of which individually assumes that one of those functions doesnt work and tests solely that function is this correct or do we need to split them up even more also we have just been using assert statements in our code is this the correct way to return a nonzero as it says in the spec for player for example when testing how count is changing when using expose we are exposing cards to the player and then asserting how the players bet changes because of it cause we cant see count there is no hand variable involved is this correct
student,when we write our tests for counting player that will be submitted do we also test the functions in counting player that are inherited from simple as in do we also test draw in our test cases even though its inherited from simple
student,does anyone know what arguments the staff passed in it looks like bankroll was 100 hands was 3 but which type of player
student,is the autograders playerfactorytest different than the one given to us our code passes our playerfactorytest but we didnt receive credit on the autograder thanks in advance
student,hello simple counting competitor i understand that counting should be drived from simple and competitor can be derived from counting but should we be writing a base class simply called player that will be the initial constructor for simple as in we would have one basic player class and then these 3 classes thanks in advance
student,can anyone provide any insight as to what the blackjacktest00student is on the autograder
student,im getting a time skew error and i dont know what that means or how to deal with it make warning file decktest02cpp has modification time 11e04 s in the future make warning clock skew detected your build may be incomplete for reference my test case file deals out two cards and checks that the second is in the correct location
student,the exposed function in player talks about how the hole card is exposed if the player doesnt get a natural 21 and doesnt bust however even in this case wouldnt it be unnecessary to call the exposed function as only after the player fully finishes hisher turn does the dealer begin hisher turn so the hole card would be exposed after the player no longer wants to hit and would not affect the players choice to hitstand am i correct with this analysis
student,when i run the make mytests command in caen i get this message im not really sure what i have to fix i dont think its an error coming from my test cases
student,is the counting player a derived class of simple player is competitor then also a derived class when it says that the counting player is keeping a count is the count specific to each card counting the number of kings or face cards that have appeared for example or is count exactly 1 for every 2 3 5 6 and 1for each face card
student,when i submitted to the autograder a lot of my tests apparently didnt compile even though they worked fine in the caen environment when i used make mytests does this mean there is a problem with the files or could this just mean that those files didnt catch a bug
student,what does it mean to have an undefined reference to vtable or typeinfo g wall werror pedantic o1 playertest00cpp cardcpp handcpp deckcpp playercpp randcpp o playertest00 tmpccr6bupzo in function global constructors keyed to z14playerfactorypkc playercpptext0x47 undefined reference to vtable for simple tmpccr6bupzorodatazti8countingtypeinfo for counting0x10 undefined reference to typeinfo for simple collect2 ld returned 1 exit status
student,i know that it says in the requires clause that it would be in the format simple counting and competitor but what should we return if none of those inputs are involved right now i just have it returning null
student,my project compiles in linux on caen on terminal and in xcode with no errors there is no difference between the output of our blackjackout and the correct output but for some reason we are getting a 01 on all the test cases except deck and card in the autograder im confused because i dont know where to start to look for an error also i dont understand why the player factory test isnt working we basically took code from the slides in lecture to make our player factory test and i dont understand why it wouldnt work please help
student,test case blackjacktest00student failed to compile blackjacktest00student 01 test case blackjacktest00withsolutionclasses failed to compile blackjacktest00withsolutionclasses 01 it keeps giving me this my code runs fine on caen and other operating systems any know why it produces the correct output for the given test
student,eg the bet method for simple counting and competitor
student,when writing our test cases can we assume that hand and card are implemented correctly
student,i just want to clarify it is ok for us to have output in our deck and player test as long as we eventually either return a 0 in cases that pass and a nonzero value in cases that dont pass so im aloud to print out cards etc
student,so i am confused about the order we are supposed to display the shuffle know we do it before hand but if after hand 7 say there are less then 20 cards do we display the shuffling then say hand 8 and the bankroll of do we display the hand first
student,the spec says if your case believes the deckplayer to be incorrect it should return any value other than zero the value 1 is commonly used to denote failure assert will return a nonzero value so this is another acceptable way to test does this mean the only way i can use assert in my test functions would be return assertsomething something why i ask right now i have multiple assert statements in each test that sort of makes sure different things are correct throughout the test for example first i test and assert that adding one card 26 didnt thus incrementing count by 1 did not make the counting player bet double the minimum then if that passes i test and assert that adding one more will make the player bet double the minimum i am trying to understand how to do it this way since i cant put multiple return statements in since it would just return once the first one is correct
student,for tests can we assume that there will only be one bug to test for each time for instance my partner and i have tests for deckdeal that rely on the fact that deckdeck is correct since the only way to know if your deal is coming out in the right order is if you know your deck is in the right order but our tests for deckdeck rely on the fact that deckdeal is correct since the only way you can see the cards in the deck is by dealing them all of our other tests rely upon deckdeal being correct as well i couldnt remember if this was stated in the spec so i just wanted to make sure because if both deckdeck and deckdeal are wrong that could cause some weirdness thanks in advance
student,is it ok for me to implement a getcount function thats not static that i can use for testing or should i test that independently then take it out of my final code
student,lets say i make count a protected member variable in counting player lets say i also make my competitor a derived class of counting player when i define my competitor does it need to have private int count or would that just be initialized with the counting player portion
student,should she shuffled function in player set count 0
student,so ive read about this on piazza and read the spec but i am still a little confused am i allowed to include cardh and handh in my player tests for example would the snippet card c6cardsix cardhearts be allowed within a player test file
student,if i pick up an 8 and a 4 my decision making in draw depends on the status of soft isnt this grey area as the hand could be initialized to either a soft count or a hard count im trying to write my test cases and this is confusing me i guess what im asking is can we assume soft is set to 1 as default in the hand constructor
student,when i run the command line prompt blackjack 100 700 counting blackjackout the outputted code uses the simple version of the bet function and when i run blackjack 100 700 simple blackjackout the code uses the counting version any advice as to common pitfalls that could be causing this i dont think the problem is with my factory function
student,so i dont know much about black jack and certainly not more than the information provided in the spec any tips or websites to go to in order to get the competitor to outperform the counting player additionally our competitor cannot split double down or take insurance correct
student,stupid question but nonetheless an important one we can submit twice a day until the deadline as usual correct
student,sorry to be this person but could an instructor please answer 2332 it seems like the sample output contradicts the rme for the handvalue function and that could be an issue for some people
student,me and my partner have the same exact code for deck on her computer no seg faults on my computer all the values and cards come out correctly but at the end of my program is notifies me of a segfault segmentation fault 11 is this just something with my computer
student,the spec tells us to used shuffled when shuffling in blackjackcpp when i do that it prints this are we supposed to get thisor should it say the deck has been reshuffled once at the end of the shuffle also when i am shuffling for the first time at the start of the game should the print say re shuffle or shuffle at the end when the scores are the same the output should be cout pushn right
student,where do i keep track of the dealers score throughout the game will this happen in the driver
student,what does this mean cardcpp22 error expected unqualifiedid before ‘’ token i had no trouble compiling remotely
student,is the minimum always 5
student,when we submitted yesterday the autograder returned a score of 1313 but when we submitted again today with more test cases it returned 2424 we are not sure what the actual score should be is it dependent on the number of test cases or something else
student,ive included cstring in my player cpp and when i compile it locally everything works fine but when i compile it in caen i get the following error message how can i fix this thanks
student,when i try to cout cardsremaining the correct value comes out but i get a seg fault however strangely enough when i cout something right after that i get no seg fault any ideas why this could be
student,do we have to check that the arguments being passed in are valid similar to the way we did with euchre as in checking if theyre acceptable intsstringschecking the number of args and if it violates it throw an error message
student,i dont understand this sentence if the players hand totals 12 he stands if the dealer shows 4 5 or 6 otherwise he hits does this mean the player stands if the dealer has one of 4 5 6 in the hand thanks in advance
student,in a previous post 2337 they say to begin the count at 1 but shuffle says to reset the count to zero why would it start at 1 and be reset to zero can someone clarify this itll be a pretty big bug
student,we are not submitting our competitor test cases correct
student,i notice that as the number of test cases submitted the total score goes up does the final score depend on the number of tests cases submitted or the percentage of them being useful
student,do we need to add an assert statement in the beginning and end of our functions or make a checkinvariant function to check the assumptions
student,when i initialize a variable to keep track of the card count for the counting player the compiler says iso c forbids inclass initialization of nonconst static member how do i go about declaring this variable without getting a compiler warning
student,does anyone know why decktest00 failed to compile butafter compiling student test cases it says it compiled successfully also i dont get why playerfactory is failing to compile because we didnt change anything and it is a starter file
student,it will make the implementation of certain strategies much easier if we have access to dynamic memory particularly for varying array sizes vectors are not listed among the allowed stdlibs
student,so i wanted to give my counting player a getter function for the count variable but whenever i call that function in one of my test files the compiler tells me no such function exists why is this the case also will i not be able to use any kind of getter function to help testing
student,i understand that when we have a potential bust and the hand is already soft that we convert one ace 11 to 1 but how do we know that we have more soft aces hand is still soft or we just converted our last soft ace to hard hand is now hard
student,so im trying to write my competitor to be a form of counting player that simply uses a different card counting strategy but still uses the same countbased algorithm to place bets my thought would be then to simply override the exposecard c function and leave everything else the same as it is for the counting player however i made the count variable in my counting player private so i had to create a new count variable for my competitor the issue with this is that when i call any of the other functions on a competitor the counting version is called as it should be but the counting classs count variable is used instead of the competitor s is there any way around this or will i have to reimplement all the other functions i know i could make the count variable in my counting player protected but id really rather not
student,my partner and i continue to get a compile error stating that rand was not declared in the scope we have a include randh statement and are using the compiling command given in the spec that include randcpp is anyonehas anyone else had a similar problem
student,when your are announcing the hands in the driver program is the first hand hand 0 or is the first hand hand 1
student,if count 2 bankroll minimum 0 should the correct output be 0
student,can we use copy the function exposeandcheckplayerbet from playerfactorytestcpp can we copy the code in that function and use it in out own test cases
student,in hand 2 of the correct output for the given test case the dealer receives face up ace of clubs hole card three of clubs he goes on to draw jack of spades eight of diamonds and busts at a total of 22 this must mean that the dealer chooses for his first ace to count as 1 why is this the case wouldnt the dealer count that ace as 11 since his hand value was 0 before the ace was drawn thanks
student,prof deorio mentioned that global variables usually imply bad design but why are dynamic variables better to use one reason i can think of is that we can delete dynamic variables whenever we want to so programmers have more control but is there any other reason i am just curious thanks a lot
student,just to double check this test case is run along with our others right
student,does the dealer hit on a soft 17 i know the spec says he hits until 17 or higherdo aces contribute to that
student,if i want to use a helper function for the competitor player i know that i need to also declare it in player class or whatever the parent class can i do this without modifying h file is there something like static virtual
student,according to the spec we should be shuffling the deck when the number of cards remaining is less than 20 can the call for the shuffle be done in blackjackcpp or should it be a conditional statement in deckcpp thank you in advance
student,should we assume that the number of hands played will be high enough some times that the deck will need to be reshuffled if so when with how many cards left in the deck should we reshuffle the deck
student,if first card dealt to player is an ace should it be counted as 11 or should it be counted as 1 or should its value not be determined until after the second card is dealt
student,
student,why does the random cuts function always choose the same 7 numbers to cut at cut at 39 cut at 22 cut at 33 cut at 37 cut at 38 cut at 37 cut at 38 should it be this way
student,when it says competitor and counting should have different strategies does that mean only in regards to how they count cards ie the expose function or does it mean they should also bet differently as well
student,the spec says the counting player should not reimplement methods of the simple player unnecessarily does this mean the counting player needs to be derived from the simple player class if not how would i go about doing this
student,when you say it is suggested to split up test cases into different files do you mean 1 1 test case per function in each file 2 all the test cases for 1 function in each file each file extensively tests 1 function 3 something else also do our test cases have to test every function for example the player factory test given to us doesnt test constructors or the draw function i just want to make sure i am understanding how to set my test cases updivide them into multiple files so that i can get the most points possible thanks
student,i have the logic worked out for addcard in handcpp and i understand how to solve for what value the incoming card contributes to the hand but what do i do with it afterwards i cant change the private member variable value to update the value of the hand and handvalue only returns the value of the hand it cant change the value of the hand i feel like this is a really simple question but i cant figure it out thank you in advance
student,when trying to compile my decktests00cpp i get this in my terminal 0587389686project 4 ed g pedantic wall werror o1 o decktest deckcpp decktest00cpp undefined symbols for architecture x8664 cardcard referenced from deckdeck in deckd77475o deckshuffleint in deckd77475o cardgetrank const referenced from main in decktest00639506o cardgetsuit const referenced from main in decktest00639506o operatorstd1basicostreamchar std1chartraitschar card const referenced from main in decktest00639506o ld symbols not found for architecture x8664 clang error linker command failed with exit code 1 use v to see invocation my cardtests00cpp compiled fine but it seems the errors are coming from my functions in cardtests im not sure anything should be wrong with the given decktests00cpp either so what does this error mean
student,before we consider the draw strategy outlined in the specs should we be checking if the upcard would produce a bust value 21
student,can we test functions of handcpp in playertestxxcpp
student,for adding to the hand value can i copy and paste the rank and suit enum into handcpp as global variables and set the card values accordingly or is there a better way to go about this
student,if anyone is good at xcode and can help me out that would be great im getting this error when i try to use the getcut function in my player test i made sure i included randh but its still not working undefined symbols for architecture x8664 getcut referenced from main in decktest01o ld symbols not found for architecture x8664 clang error linker command failed with exit code 1 use v to see invocation
student,is it a possible scenario that the cards in the deck will run out during a hand being played out if so how are we expected to handle it i know that we are supposed to check at the beginning of a hand if a deck is less than 20 cards and to therefore shuffle it but what happens if it becomes less than 20 during the hand
student,so my code is passing the blackjack test but is not passing the blackjack test with solution classes i have no idea why that is so what is exactly being tested in that one
student,does the hand count start with 0 or 1
student,not sure how to approach the implementation of discardall and addcard the rmes seem very simple so should we be following some guidelines from the spec
student,we have a lot of compiler messages for undefined references advice please
student,question 1 in the project spec it says that if dealt a natural 21 we ignore the play phase and the player wins immediately but do we have to cout the statement player wins immediately afterward or leave it as is 2 lets say we give our counting player a hand value of 100 should it continue standing as is or should it complain
student,the rme clause given in handh for handhandvalue says int handvalue const effects returns the present value of the blackjack hand the highest blackjack total possible without going over 21 if the hand is over 21 any value over 21 may be returned so according to this specification for example returning 200 for any hand which has busted meets the specification however as part of the game driver were required to print the value of a hand even if it goes over 21 for example from blackjacktest00outcorrect on lines 28 and 29 dealers total is 22 dealer busts so that means there is a value that is officially assigned to each hand since its specifically printed here according to the spec since each of your implementation cpp files will be graded separately by compiling it with our solution code do not write code that contains interfile dependencies such that one of your files depends on another one of your files emphasis added so we wont run into any difficulties when our blackjackcpp is being graded since it will use the official correct handcpp however are we supposed to replicate this behavior anyway for our own handcpp or is it actually sufficient to return any arbitrary value over 21 as the rme suggests
student,since we are not allowed to access private data member how can we test a specific position in the array of cards do we just keep deal one to that position
student,1 do we have to test playerfactory 2 what does best total count mean if the player has a six and an ace what would be the best total count 3 is the default value for ace 11 if that is the case does it mean we only change the value of ace to 1 when the player will bust if the ace is counted as 11 4 do we have to increment the next after deal do we have to guarantee that the pointer next will be set back to the address of the first card in shuffle 5 if may not happen in the real case just for testing the individual function what should the function deal behave if the next pointer is currently pointed to the last card will next still be incremented or stay at the current position and what would be the expected value of cardremaining if pointer is out of bound should it be 0
student,i was thinking about calling the alternative constructor for reset and i was wondering if that would be okay to do or if it is not okay since it is in another file
student,should we make dealer as in player in blackjackcpp i do not really get how else we can keep the track of dealers score also if the player is counting and when the deck shuffles in the beginning are we supposed to call shuffled 7 times or just once
student,still looking for a clarification any help would be appreciated 2199
student,im confused about what private member variables we need or do not need in our derived player classes i thought the players would need a bankroll and a hand but i saw in other piazza posts that bankroll is not necessary which led me to question whether a hand member variable is necessary following on this for the draw function would simplecounting need a hand in their member variables in order to pass in hand simple or hand counting to the function or can it be done entirely outside of the class and in the implementation of blackjackcpp finally if there are no member variables for any of the derived players except for a count variable for counting does this mean that our simple player doesnt need a constructor thanks
student,if we add a function such as a getcount function in playercpp for testing purposes and call it in our test cases will it not work because it will be linked to other cpp files
student,the project spec asks us to list the specific behavior that the implementation must exhibit in at most three sentences im just wondering where this should be in my files should i have the three sentences in a comment at the top of each test case file
student,1 is handissoft simply a getter function or the decision of hard or soft should be made within this 2 for simply player if the player has no aces which rule would she follow 3 if the player has 2 aces one if hard and the other is soft then the bool value of soft in hand should be true
student,im getting the following error when i try to compile my deck files nonmember function cannot have const qualifier int cardsremaining const anyone know what this means
student,i believe my grow function is correctly implemented however i am getting the following compiler error intvectorlab09cpp in member function ‘void arrayintvectorgrow’ intvectorlab09cpp113 error no matching function for call to ‘arrayintvectorarrayintvector’ intvectorlab09cpp17 note candidates are virtual arrayintvectorarrayintvector any help would be much appreciated
student,can the count of cards go negative for example suppose the count is 0 and a face card is exposed would that make the count 1 or leave it as 0
student,when it says returns next card to be dealt is that referring to the card at the top of the deck when you call deal or the card after you move the next pointer to the next card
student,according to the specs we are supposed to call getcut in the beginning of the game to shuffle the deck at specific cuts but when i run the program i am getting the same cut points every time i am not sure if this is how its supposed to be or the getcut function is supposed to randomly generate different numbers every time it runs
student,how will competitor be graded will you try and run it with the autograder with some inputs and see what bankroll we make it to or is it hand graded also how many rounds should we usually expect i only ask because i made my competitor cheat and be ultraintelligent so i get an int overflow for the bankroll after about 62 hands will this be a problem for the autograder
student,i have been checking in ctools for a while and have submitted all labs on time however labs 1 6 7 8 still havent been graded they are noted as submitted in ctools i was just wondering if there is something wrong or are they still in the process of being graded thank you
student,if i can access the private variable soft in side all the functions in hand why do i need a function to do it
student,i have this test case for my deck which runs normally on xcode and normally on linux when compiled with g but it seg faults when i use o1 wall werror when i use gdb to see the backtrace after it segfaults it says main is the only thing on the stack and just has its address what could be the possible cause for this and how can i fix it
student,lets say that the player wants to hit and get more cards after the first four cards have been dealt he gets some and notices that he has a 21 he stands what should be outputted here should the dealer continue to play and add more cards should he still reveal his hole card or should it just output that the player dealt natural 21 and move on to the next hand
student,if next points to cards51 and i deal that card next will point to cards52 which doesnt exist will the memory location of my pointer be right next to cards51 or is it undefined if it is undefined how can i do cardsremaining because currently i have it returning cards51 next 1 if i cant count on next to always be next too or in side of cards then tips on how to do this function
student,what kind difference between my strategy and given strategy is acceptable i mean if i just change some numberseg player bets double when count 1 player stands when hard 12 and dealer shows 47 will this difference be too minor for this project thanks
student,hi at the top of blackjackcpp are randh playerh and deckh the only header files i want to include i was looking through the other piazza posts but couldnt find a concrete answer to my question thanks
student,the player interface selection is selfexplanatory however the previous two arguments are not as simple of course it does not make sense for the bankroll or hands to be negative however can they be equal to 0 even if it makes things somewhat pointless and what is the upper bound for the values 100 hands 1000000 bankroll
student,currently i have getrank returning the integer value of its enum so passing the two of spades returns 0 three returns 1 etc my program works fine but im worried about the unit tests after seeing this line in the spec each card numbered 210 is worth its rank value the number on the card does this mean my getrank function should be returning the play value of the card instead if so ten jack queen and king have the same rank thanks
student,if player and dealer are both dealt natural 21s do we cout push in the specs it says that that is the only case where the hands are equal but not considered push but does this only affect the bankroll or what we cout too
student,should we print error messages and call exit failure if the command line arguments arent in proper formatone of the specified commands or is it a given that the arguments will be correct
student,in the draw fnc what is card dealer in the inputs is that the up card that the dealer has it just seems weird it effects it so much
student,i was wondering if i have to write explicit tests for the deal function in testing my shuffle reset and ctor i use deal to access the next card to make sure that the deck was correct will any buggy deal code be caught by these indirect tests or should i create a specialized file
student,i ge the error devlaration of player as member of simple on the line of my virtual player in all three classes
student,just to clarify we would not lose points if we only changed the bet function in competitor correct it is not necessary to also change draw
student,if our test cases test both the simple and the counting player will that be an issue
student,ive searched piazza but im still not sure about this do we need to declare a private member variable for hand in our implementation of each player or do we declare the hand object parallel to the player ie when im testing should i just be able to ask my player object for its hand or do i need to declare a separate hand object
student,hello so my partner and i are running into a conundrum he has the exact same files as me hes been running the project off linux while im running it off ssh through my mac terminal mine is working fine when compiling and running the test files individually through g or through python his either way is getting stack smashing errors and were not sure why any advice
student,in deck for cards remaining i am trying to move next to point to the next card doing next but the compiler gives an error saying read only variable is not assignable i thought my approach was valid
student,as im working on playercpp im noticing that ive been using the suit and rank enum types defined in cardh for some of my decision making logic ive noted in the spec that my own files should not be interdependent however 1968 seems to indicate that we should be using these enum types is it safe to assume that playercpp and also deckcpp can depend on cardh for the suit and rank enum types thanks
student,when do we use the vs the operator for actions that are being done to the deck in blackjackcpp where we have to use those functions do we have to declare a deck for example declare deck a and get cards remaining by doing acardsremaining we cant just call member functions from the other classes deckhand etc in blackjack without declaring an object of that class right
student,when testing playerfactory i realized my function is returning null pointers how do i fix this issue
student,i would assume that the answer is yes but when writing the destructor in the post lab survey do structs contain multiple memory spaces so when deleting the struct you use the delete operator
student,i couldnt find what the holecard was is that the card that is facedown to the dealer also when the spec says that the dealer deals four cards faceup to the player faceup to himself faceup to the player and facedown to himself can i imagine this as all faceup cards to the dealerplayer as cards in the dealersplayers hand that the other person cannot see and the facedown card to the dealer as a card just laying on the table in front of the dealer
student,if i want to implement a strategy for the competitor player to bet based off of how many wins the player has is there a way we can do this with competitor as a derived type we cant really create our own accessible member functions for competitor such as playerwon or playerlost since were just using the player interface so is there a better way to keep track of wins within the player class parameters
student,so my code compiles and runs my output matches the blackjackoutcorrect or whatever it is exactly however when i submit it to the autograder i get the following errors are there any common errors that students do that results in this
student,the spec states if the hand is over 21 any value over 21 may be returned if the value is 22 should i return 1 or 22
student,the spec says we only need to submit tests for deck and counting player then will it be a problem that we submit our simple tests as well we just realize we dont need to hand in tests for simple player actually
student,are we supposed to output the player and dealer hands values every time they hit or just after they are done adding cards
student,may we include deckh in our player tests if we want to make a deck and use it for testing of player
student,hi when we submit all our files to the autograder we get 5050 but when we run all of our tests in caen using the provided script it says something like 1065 tests failed or somethingis there any way to see which test files are failing without compiling them one by one also does the autograder just not check to see if a test file passes or fails thanks
student,the driver program takes three command line arguments blackjack bankroll hands simplecountingcompetitor since the program is called blackjack that would be argv0 right and simplecountingcompetitor would be argv3 right doesnt that mean the size should be 4 not 3
student,dynamic memory seems fundamental for classes that we define but do classes that can be imported into code use dynamic memory i was trying to think of places in like string where it would be used but i have no idea and im not sure if the code for string is even open source are there any examples of dynamic memory that we have been using all along
student,in lecture we seemed to have fixed every leak problem we found by adding a new part of the big three so if a custom class has a destructor copy constructor and overloaded assignment operator is it still possible to have a memory leak with that class could you provide an example please
student,lets say that i have a player and lets say that i deal him the following cards 1 an ace of diamonds his count is 11 a soft hand 2 an ace of clubs his count is now 12 a hard hand 3 then lets say i deal him a king of hearts the players hand is now classified as a hard hand with a count of 22 if i read the spec correctly in real life he would have the option of converting his score of 22 into a score of 12 are we supposed to implement a feature in our program similar to this option
student,what does just one ace in a hand count as lets say that i am writing my test cases and i give player1 an ace regardless of whether it is a one or eleven the player must hit but i am not sure if i should count it as a one or eleven
student,are we allowed to make count a public member variable
student,im trying to figure out where my code isnt working what is the correct output of the deal test that is given to us with the starter files ie 2 of spades 2 of clubs etc
student,hi i need clarification on the specs it is stated that in deckshuffle the way they shuffle is splitting the deck into two parts left is when the cards with previous index of 0 to n1 and right is the index from n to 51 it is stated that the way the new deck is rearrange is that the new decks index 0 is the first card in the right which is the index n then the left index 0 then n1 then 1 and so on however in the examples when we shuffle when n 26 the first card is 2 of clubs which is the first card in the left then 3 of clubs which is n 26 and then index 1 and so on may i know if i misunderstood the specification thanks
student,in handcpp do we need to create an array of cards in the constructor or are we simply keeping track of the points based on the value of the hand
student,i am trying to declare card nextcard deckdeal apparently the compiler tells me that it is a segmentation fault can someone help me with that thanks
student,im trying to count with abool value can a bool hold a value of 2 or 3 and still return true or once you place a value in it becomes strictly logical say i have bool example so what im saying is i say example 2 then later on i want it to be example 1 will these values hold so that both 2 and 1 will return true and then if i subtract another from it it will become false
student,i was wondering if this means that n can take on the values 152 or if it can take on the values 051 originally when reading it seemed as though it could be 052 however that gives a total of 53 cards impossible i just want to make sure i am understanding its implications correctly thank you
student,what does adding using namespace std after the include statements do exactly will code not work if you omit that ive always just added it in every file ive written but never really asked why
student,since the rme for the bet function says nothing about actually modifying the bankroll variable are we supposed to keep track of the players bankroll somewhere else and leave it untouched in the bet function
student,hand 52 bankroll 980 player bets 5 player dealt ace of diamonds dealer dealt queen of clubs player dealt king of hearts player dealt natural 21 players total is 21 dealers hole card is three of spades dealer dealt eight of spades dealers total is 21 push hand 53 bankroll 987 looking through my output i was wondering whether a natural 21 should make the dealer reveal and continue to play in this case it results in a push however the payout is still 7 should the hand end after the player gets a natural 21
student,is it okay to edit the mytests python file in order to include tests for the hand card and deck i feel like these portions are just as critical to the project as the player file can we edit it an leave it like that if not i will just edit it and download the original before submittal
student,could we write our own cardcompare function in say cardcpp to make it easier to compare two cards just want to make sure this wont mess anything up with regards to submission
student,when the specs say to tell the player that the deck was shuffled what does this mean i understand that the counter would be set back to zero if the player was of type counting but besides that how do you let the player know the deck was shuffled
student,what exactly does blackjacktest00withsolutionclasses 01 mean
student,still a little confused with what the expose function should do how is it different from addcard could we call expose in addcard thanks
student,is there a way to increment enums for instance if i want to do hearts is there a way i can increment spades to get it
student,does the autograder score depend on how many files we submit or how good our test cases are also is there a max amount of points we can get on the autograder
student,when player hits do we need to add card to her hand if so how do we know which card to add
student,are we allowed to use return in void functions to preemptively end the functionsay to break out of an ifelse situation context hand addcard
student,quick question about playerdraw why is the players hand passed in like this const hand player i should know this but what does the ampersand denote does it mean that the players hand is passed in by reference or its a pointer
student,how do we determine whether the hand is soft or hard i know this has to be done in the respective if statement in the add card function but im confused as to what determines whether it is soft or hard from another piazza question you have to consider whether the hand is currently hard or soft and based on that and the current hand value add 11 or 1 such that the player has the most preferable choice from 1 and 11 what that means is the handvalue should not go over 21 because of using 11 where 1 would have prevented it from going over 21 2 questions from that post 1 we dont initialize bool soft until we get to the add card function so how do we fix that issue 2 so basically we add 11 if adding 11 doesnt put the value over the 21 mark otherwise we add 1 then change the bool soft respectively
student,i am getting an error that says the stack around d is corrupted what would cause this is this a memory leak
student,the spec says that if a player has a natural 21 and there wager is 5 the payout with integer arithmetic would be 7 do we fix this and change it to 75 somehow or leave the payout at 7
student,so even though the spec says write your test cases first we do not need to submit test cases for card and hand correct only deck0n and player 0n
student,what does this mean error player may be used uninitialized in this function
student,the spec says the counting player should not reimplement methods of the simple player unnecessarily i know that this includes the draw function what im confused about is whether or not i have to put anything into the counting class for draw if i just dont put anything then later on in my main function i have competitorptrdraw will it know to use the draw function from simple thanks
student,this question is kind of basic i wrote and compiled cardcpp shouldnt the next step be to compile cardtest00cpp and run that function shouldnt this be the method of writing deck and hand as well when i try running cardtest00cpp the terminal tells me permission denied thanks in advance
student,hello we are trying to implement our player class but when we try to declare a player variable we get an error object of abstract class simple not allowedwhy might this be
student,is the shuffle supposed to happen as soon as there is less than 20 cards in the deck or do we wait till the end of that hand then shuffle
student,i know that in the driver program when the player has too little money to make a minimum wager the game is over for testing purposes of player then can i assume that there will never be a case in which bet is called with minimum bankroll
student,should our code output player dealt ace of spades and dealer dealt two of hearts the first time through or are those arbitrary examples thanks
student,just looking for some clarification here its my understanding that we will be declaring thee additional derived player classes simple counting competitor in the playerh file and add their respective function implementations in the playercpp file i also believe well have to declare our own member variables for each of the three derived classes is this thinking correct thanks in advance
student,in playercpp i declared static simple psimple it seems like visual studio does not like it when i changed it to static simple psimple or static simple psimple it works fine i understand that it is due to the fact that simple is abstract however it seems like the first method is the way we do it in class or on xcode is that due to the fact that i dont have constructor in simple thanks
student,when calling playerfactory in my blackjackcpp file i am getting the following error tmpcctvuttdo in function playerfactorychar const blackjackcpptext0x441 multiple definition of playerfactorychar const tmpccukik8foplayercpptext0x6f first defined here collect2 ld returned 1 exit status i have left playerh untouched and then wrote the implementation for playerfactory in my playercpp file so im confused as to what this error means thanks in advance
student,do we have to announce the players total each time heshe takes a card or do we announce the players total one time after they have stopped taking cards
student,i am confused about this in regards to the overloaded operator function discussed in lecture today since this function modifies the current objects member variables why must we return a reference to itself wont all of the copying already be complete by the time return this is reached how would returning void be any different id really appreciate it if someone could explain this to me thanks
student,should expose have output or is its only job to adjust the count
student,when i run blackjackcpp i have found that my simple player does consistently better than my counting player also when i have the game go for many hands 10000 i found that the player doesnt seem to be losing but rather their bankroll just keeps steadily increasing is something wrong or is this ok
student,is the draw function called after the dealt cards are added to the players hand or before
student,when there are less than 20 cards remaining in the deck how many times are we supposed to shuffle do we do it 7 times or just once
student,what does calling the constructor in the reset deck function really doing is is creating another deck of card just conceptually confused
student,just to clarify the minimum wager a player can make is 5
student,my main function wasnt working with grow doubling datacapacity as too much memory was eaten up by doubling the size of the array each time so instead of doubling i just increment datacapacity by one in grow copy the current array into a new one that is one space bigger and use delete on data before setting data to point to the new dynamic array the main function works fine now and all the answers match the solutions but im sure im doing something incorrect what is it

student,i know that we are supposed to code the player derived classes in playercpp i also know that we are not supposed to include any cpp files but how then are we supposed to test the implementations of these derived classes in the playertest files for example i am trying to test the bet function for the simple player derived class and i am not sure how to link the test file with the file containing the implementation of the simple player derived class
student,bool drawcard dealer const hand player the const hand player is of type hand when implementing this function we want to take into account the hands value to determine if the dealer hits or not but since they are in the hand class doesnt that mean they are private how do we access that information from my simple class
student,im trying to work out a solution to the problem of skipping over code once a winning condition has been met natural 21 either player busts goto would work but were not allowed to use it for this project conditioning every code block on win conditions is a workable but very tedious solution is there a more efficient way to solve this problem using the tools were allowed to use
student,the spec makes it sound like we only need to submit test cases for counting player not for simple or competitor is this true
student,just clarifying that i understood the rme correctly the card dealer passed to the draw function is the first card dealt to the dealer thanks
student,im trying to compile my player using the command make playertests and i am getting the error no rule to make target file playertest00 needed by playertests
student,just to clarify the only thing that counting player will do different than simple player is bet more when the count is high counting player will not use the count in any other way
student,using valgrind my output comes out with 0 free errors but there is a lot of text surrounding the output of the grow function is this normal or do i need to do something to get rid of this
student,if draw is true is that the equivalent of a hit for example if the handvalue is already 12 and the upcard in draw is an ace of spades does draw return true
student,where is the count for the counting player located and how does the count interact with expose in other words is anything happening within expose that directly affects the count kept track by the counting player
student,when trying to increment next in my deckcpp file im hit with an error telling me that readonly variable is not assignable any explanations thanks in advance
student,any hint on how to improve the performance of the competitor player it seems that the counting player has already have a wellrounded strategy
student,i do not really get how to make the function remember what the cards were dealt previouslyor restore the cards that are already dealt can someone guide me to the right direction with this
student,for blackjackcpp do we have to include errors and exitmessages if the user types in more than 3 arguments plus the executable like we did with the euchre project
student,can i add a dealer class to keep track of their hand value through a private member variable or something
student,i am a little confused about expose i understand that not every card is exposedthe dealers down card if the player busts or if he gets a bj but are those exceptions coded into expose or is that going to be taken into account later on and we only need to deal with lowering or raising the count in exposed
student,why did i always get the same result for getcut it always returned me 39 22 33 37 38 37 38
student,just want to make sure i have the understanding of the game correctly even if a player reaches 21 not natural 21 the dealer still plays until he either stands or busts then compare the two values to see who won
student,when i run make mytests i get the error no rule to make target decktest00 needed by decktests i have all the starter files and the spec says to name the test files as decktest00cppdecktest01cppdecktestnncpp so i am confused as to why make mytests is calling for decktest00 and not decktest00cpp
student,should our code output player dealt ace of spades and dealer dealt two of hearts the first time through or are those arbitrary examples thanks
student,does competitor player must be derived from counting player
student,for this function pushback i simply added one line of code which checks if numelements capacity if so increment capacity when i run the main function it tells me that lab09exe has triggered a breakpoint why is that
student,a previous post stated that we should improve both the bet and draw functions for the competitor however after looking at a few hitstand tables it seems the simple player already uses the correct method for drawing for our simplified version of blackjack is there a way using card counting to improve the draw function i have been looking online and have been unable to find anything
student,where can i find the lab09 postquiz i got the email for the prequiz but not the post quiz
student,no variables exist in the player class so i was wondering if we should be adding variables to the simple and counting players i know for counting we should probably have an int count so it can keep track but for simple and counting are we supposed to be keeping track of each players bankroll and how it changes every round within the players derived class aka defining a private variable called bankroll
student,partner and i just submitted and got xx36 but on a previous submit we got xx34 am i going insane or are these supposed to be changing is the out of points changing because we are adding more test case files or because they are publishing more test cases thank you
student,the spec says the simple player always places the minimum allowable wager the function provides us with the minimum wager and their bankroll doesnt this mean we just return the minimum as the bet why do we need the bankroll argument feel like im missing something
student,i am on part three of the lab and i believe i have done the first two parts of the lab correctly i keep getting this error lab0915100x7fff73464300 malloc error for object 0x7fb990404b60 pointer being freed was not allocated after adding in the part that delete the data array setting the data pointer to null works independently what do this error mean and how could i go about fixing it
student,how does one go about getting valgrind on a mac i do my coding in xcode but since there are multiple main functions due to the test cases in the projects i need to compile through the terminal and id like to use valgrind to debug
student,when are test case files thrown out only if they return a false negative
student,the constructor in the prelab survey is myclassint xin double yin x xin y yin c new int d new mystruct arr new int10 but x and y arent defined in the scope i think its either supposed to be bx and by or something but this will definitely not compile
student,do we want to make a derived class for the dealer or how should we hand their handcards during the game
student,can we make functions above the main in blackjackcpp to use in our driver
student,i assume our definitions for the 3 derived classes go in playercpp and we need to implement the pure virtual functions that will be used for the derived classes
student,we need to declare 3 global variable pointers in player to pass into the factory function im confused on what they would be initialized to though what address do you assign to them
student,how would you recommend i go about testing shuffle ive gone through using a real deck to make sure i know what the deck would look like if i shuffled it at multiple spots but then would i have to manually go through each card in the deck or just check a few cards in the deck
student,quick question on soft and hard do we consider each ace hard or soft or once the hand is set as hard or soft all aces are changed to that
student,how will test cases factor into our project 4 grade percent wise or will we not know that until after grading has been finished
student,netbeans has given me blackjackcpp975 error stray 302 in program for the line were supposed to write if all hands have been played or if the players bankroll does not meet the minimum bet blackjackcpp975 error stray 302 in program netbeans also spit out blackjackcpp975 error stray 255 in program for this line int mainint char any idea on what these errors mean
student,correct me if i misinterpreted the specs but we should expose the holecard after the player stands whats the point of exposing the holecard if the player stands i mean the player isnt gonna draw any more cards
student,can we directly use the code written for card print in our project 4 or is this considered an honor code violation if so is the declaration of static const suit names legal under the specs
student,quick question in my deck shuffle function i am trying to make two temporary arrays of cards the left side and the right side when i compile i am getting an iso c forbids variable length array arrayname error i googled this and it seems that the best way around this is using vectors which i am not looking to do is there anything else i can do to fix this
student,is it fine to make constructors in our derived classes also could we add a get function that we could use to look at our private member variables while we are in playertests would this cause the auto grader to fail if we used asserts with our own get function
student,usually when we make global constants we put them at the top if i want global contents of a class type do i have to implement them below the classes or am i missing something
student,when we are testing the counting player can we use expose in our playertests to keep track of the count for the cards that are in the players hand this is the only way i can think of how to be able to tell what the count is because draw will only be able to keep track of the dealers card
student,do we call expose for all face up cards like even including the players cards
student,can we create extra member functions in our derived classes for example in my counting player i have a private member variable or two and when i need to reset them to the initial state can i have a member function that does so or do i have to create a whole new player to run the constructor
student,everything compiles and runs on my machine and in the caen environment but when i send it to the autograder i get an error saying student test playertest00cpp failed to compile ive triple checked everything to the best of my ability and still nothing am i missing something obvious
student,im working on the blackjackcpp file and when i try to initialize the result of playerfactory the compiler tells me that class player has no member variable named bankroll this makes sense since player has no private member variables but my factory function passes the published test case so shouldnt i be able to expect that the object i passed to it with the argument simple will be of type simple my definition of simple includes a bankroll member variable
student,i didnt catch this in lecture but does the destructor on this code run after the delete or the ptr0 if you did just delete would the destructor still run
student,in deckcpp i have included cardh and deckh but the following code does not work card ccardrank0 cardsuit0 cardsi c the compiler says that i cannot use the operator but instead candidates are card cardoperatorconst card why is this isnt cards an array of cards not an array of card addresses in addition i tried to fill the deck using the next pointer but this also failed so if anyone could give me any pointers no pun intended on how to fill the deck that would be greatly appreciated thanks
student,found this in the spec just wanted to confirm is the player min bet always 5 this would also mean that the bankroll must be 5 or greater so is that a check we need to make from the command line input lastly do we need to have fail checks like we did in euchre or are we promised no erroneous input
student,will we receive a style grade on our test cases that we submit
student,does the reset function change the next pointer to the first card in the deck or keep the card it was pointing to before
student,when compiling blackjackcpp i get this error it goes on for quite a while i think it might be because im using the hand class wrong but i really dont know thanks
student,partner and i are looking to start the competitor and we have been perusing blackjack sight for inspiration some of the more popular strategies look really fun such as paroli and 1326 is it ok to use those for competitor if we cite where we got the idea from or does our plan need to be completely independent of public strategies thank you
student,i got the following code include iostream using namespace std class base public base virtual void talk cout base talkn virtual base cout destroying basen it is important because the c standard exprdelete paragraph 3 states in the first alternative delete object if the static type of the object to be deleted is different from its dynamic type the static type shall be a base class of the dynamic type of the object to be deleted and the static type shall have a virtual destructor or the behavior is undefined and it is must be virtual or the dtor for derive will not be called even if you explicitly define it class derive public base public derive virtual void talk cout derive talkn derive cout destroying deriven then may deallocate dynamic data if you dont provide a destructor for derived then one gets created automatically int main base baseptr new derive delete baseptr return 0 i want c experts to check if i understand the concepts correctly 1 no dtor for both the compiler will create only 1 dtor for base for me prints nothing 2 no dtor for base but has derive the compiler will crete only 1 dtor for base for me but prints nothing 3 no dtor for base and virtual derive the compiler will crete only 1 dtor for base for me but prints nothing 4 base and no dtor for derive the compiler wont create any dtor for me prints destroying base 5 base and derive for derive the compiler wont create any dtor for me prints destroying base 6 base and virtual derive for derive the compiler wont create any dtor for me prints destroying base 7 virtual base and no dtor for derive the compiler will create a dtor for derive for me prints destroying base 8 virtual base and derive the compiler will call both dtors prints destroying base followed by destroying derive 9 virtual base and virtual derive the compiler will call both dtors prints destroying base followed by destroying derive in case 13 since we may create new int in derive and no dtor for derive is ever created there will be memory leak in case 46 since dtor for base is not virtual the destroying process will stop at base so there will be memory leak still in case 7 although we have virtual dtor for base since dtor for derive is not defined the destroying process will still stop at base so there will be memory leak still case 89 refer to what prof deorio said in lecture put another way if you have a virtual function and a destructor then the destructor probably needs to be virtual too but my question is why case 8 gives what we want even though dtor for derive is not virtual does it mean that we only need to make the base dtor virtual and the derived dtor is always virtual by default as long as we explicity type derive sorry for my lengthy question thank you very much
student,while writing various test cases we know when the assert should terminate the program therefore should we try to write a bunch of obviously buggy test cases to purposely trigger the assert statement for example considering the given test case for counting player bet if i leave the values of min 10 expectedbet 20 but change the bankroll to a much smaller number to force the assert statement to happen is this what we should be doing along with some obviously correct test cases thanks
student,i was reading that we are only required to test counting player functions not simple or competitive the only functions in the counting player subclass are the expose bet and shuffled functions therefore are we not required to test the player draw function at all thank you
student,if i want to initialize the cards array using cardsi cardranksuit does this mean that a new card object is built and it will last till the end of the function
student,is there a maximum number of cards that a player can have in his hand
student,our players are using the wrong expose function for example if the player is simple it is using countings expose and vice versa also for the bet functions it works fine when we say simple beti j but when it runs in exposeandcheckplayerbet it runs countings bet function and vice versa we cannot find where the problem is thank you
student,im slightly confused on the implementation of the driver file if the deck has less than 20 cards does that mean we reset the deck to its original 52 card state along with shuffling it if not how do we avoid the deck running out of cards after enough hands
student,how different must the competitor strategy be from the simplecounting players could it be as minor as just making a slightly more intelligent betting strategy and thats it or must it improve both bet draw
student,do you have to include next in the initializer list if so should it be initialized to null the first card in the deck what should the argument be that youre putting into it ie i tried nextcards0 which doesnt work any hintstips would be appreciated thanks
student,when running the command makecardtest00 i generate twenty errors some of which claim that my code contains the word book and recommends changing it to bool as well as many errors stating that a null character was ignored my partner and i have the exact same code and his is running properly any idea what the problem is
student,when testing a function such as bet how do we know that the expose function works and that it keeps track of count can we count the expose functions behavior as part of the bet functions behavior does the version of counting player were testing have a private variable for the count or do we keep track of that ourselves in the test and if they do do we count its correctness or failure as part of the bet functions behavior
student,is it recommendedallowed to create extra member variables in the classes whose header files are already given for example i think an integer variable that holds the value of a card would be useful in the card class is this a good idea
student,does the countingplayer class have to be derived from simpleplayer or can both just be derived from the player base class it doesnt seem to make a significant difference to me either way but the spec said not to unnecessarily reimplement fxns from simpleplayer in countingplayer so im not sure if thats implying that countingplayer needs to be derived from simpleplayer
student,do we need to decrement cardsremaining in our deal function if yes any hints
student,when i try to compile and run my deckcpp and decktest00cpp classes i am getting some weird errors the compiler is giving me several undefined reference to cardgetrank const and undefined reference to cardgetsuit const in the decktest00cpp file i havent changed anything in decktest00cpp so im not really sure what this error means any help appreciated
student,if natural 21 or player or dealer busts do we announce the winner or is that assumed i would assume not but i just want to be sure
student,im having trouble declaring the three global instances for each player currently i just have static simpleplayer simple where simpleplayer is the name of my simple player class this gives me an error saying that it is an unknown type name is there something else that i should include
student,what is handvalue if ace nine and another nine are added to the hand i think it should be 19 instead of 29 bust because soft can be changed back to false if not chaning soft would lead to busting right if so do we need to test for this case in playertestnncpp i dont think so because no functions in player keep track of handvalue draw takes a hand but that is done in handcpp for which we do not need to write tests right thanks a lot
student,does anyone remember which lecture to look at for an example of how to downcast through an adt im trying to downcast my player pointer to one of the types to access the private member variable
student,just some clarification because im being confused by some other piazza posts the only adts were required to write tests for as part of this project are the deck and countingplayer correct the simpleplayer card hand and competitorplayer should be tested thoroughly but not as part of the impltestnn portion yes
student,im assuming this playerfactorytest is not referring to the one in the starter files
student,were writing our deck behavior test cases and trying to test specific features of the adt to make sure a deck has 52 cards for example just like the spec said but were also wondering if we have to within each of these behavior test cases make sure they work alongside a member function like shuffle do we have to do this or should shuffle itself be considered its own behavior that we can just test within 1 separate cpp file
student,when the player is dealt a natural 21 the spec mentions that the player wins at 32 odds if a player wagers 10 they win 15 does this mean that they win 15 on top of getting their wager back or just 15
student,im sure this is a dumb question but how do i compile just my cardcpp tests to a file i can run like cardtestnn this is possible right
student,so while doing test cases for deck i wanted to initialize a card to compare to the expected card in a certain part of the deck but the compiler fails saying that spades is not declared in this scope even though i did include cardh what is the reason for this can i not initialize a card in a deck test case
student,can we shuffle a deck of 40 cards another way i may ask is do we need to factor the cardsremaining into our shuffle or we always shuffle all 52
student,can anyone explain as to why this happens
student,the specs say i cannot include anything besides what is given and cant call any functions outside my library just to clarify does this mean i cannot use the card constructor in my deckcpp because im having a hard time doing that
student,see question
student,if the dealer has a six and nine in hand then he receives an ace will he hit or he can choose to count the ace as an 1
student,will there be any possible regrades for project 3 if our project didnt compile in linux but worked fine on xcode i know that this is 100 due to our own fault thanks
student,how do you print a card to output i know we are provided with this function definition stdostream operator stdostream os const card c how would you use that to print a card out
student,i realize that test cases are super important but im not sure what to look out for when testing cards i realize its unnecessary to test and assert every single card of every suit in the deck but what special instances of cards should i be extra careful of thanks
student,can we include deckh in our playercpp file
student,are the player classes supposed to be called simple counting and competitor or something different
student,is it true that the reshuffle is basically performing the shuffle again on the deck and reset next to the first card if that is the case when will we need to call the function deckreset
student,they both modify the hand to be that of an empty blackjack hand doesnt this mean we just have to modify the private data variable so that the hand would be empty i dont understand the difference between the functions
student,are we allowed to print a private member variable specifically count within a member function if not is there any other way to access this member variable for debugging purposes or am i just left with printing this member variable in the member function and then before submitting deleting the cout statement
student,when testing with player factory our bet for simple player returns the value after going through the counting players bet function rather than the simple players we think the problem is because counting player is derived from simple player but were pretty sure were declaring it correctly any ideas
student,what does this error mean deckcpp3411 error variable length array of nonpod element type card card leftsizeleft declared temp arrays for left and right arrays in my deck shuffle function
student,are we allowed to make setter functions in cardcpp to be used for the reset function in deckcpp
student,how would we test blackjackcpp to make sure everything displays properly eg natural 21 the way im thinking of right now is disabling the shuffling in the game and redefine reset in deckcpp so that it resets to a specific order is there any other way anyone else can think of
student,note if shuffle is called on a deck that has already had some cards dealt those cards should first be restored to the deck in the order in which they were dealt preserving the most recent postshuffledpostreset state so if i do this deck d dshuffle32 ddeal ddeal ddeal dshuffle32 will the above code result in the same order as deck e eshuffle32 ereset eshuffle32 in other words should deck d and e possess the same order
student,so in my playercpp i have class simpleplayer public player implementation here static simpleplayer sp but when i try to compile this it says expected initializer before sp whats my problem thanks
student,i am trying to set the next pointer to the first card in the deck after shuffling however i cant figure out how to do it my thought was to do nextcards0 but that doesnt seem to be working could someone give a hint on how to fix thisan example of how to correctly use the next pointer thanks
student,since each of your implementation cpp files will be graded separately by compiling it with our solution code do not write code that contains interfile dependencies such that one of your files depends on another one of your files for example do not write an extern function in handcpp that you use in playercpp i am having a hard time understanding what this means for example is this saying that my handcpp file should not have an include cardh how does this impact writing test files
student,is the following considered to contain a magic number in our decktestxxcpp assertdcardsremaining 51 i can easily change this to dcardsremaining decksize 1 but there are many similar cases in our test files so should we change them all thanks a lot
student,can we assume functions in handcpp work properly when testing playercpp specifically can we just test bet draw expose and shuffled in playertestnncpp thanks a lot
student,when trying to use the enums for rank and suit from cardh in deckcpp we get an error type not declared in scope we thought since they were public in cardh they would be visible to deckcpp after they were include cardh how do you access these enums or do you have to make new enums in deckcpp
student,so i understand that we dont need to keep track of the individual cards we can just add their value to the hand however is the addcard function supposed to be where we determine if it should be hard or soft for example if we were passed an ace to that function should it look at the currently value variable and add a 1 if otherwise adding an 11 would make it bust
student,are all the cout statements to be placed in main rather than individual functions
student,for deck a lot of the rmes say the member function modifies this i dont see a member variable called this though what is this
student,q does simple have the power to switch between hard and soft or does it stick to one once it is set what should the default be for aces
student,from the specs the first set of rules apply if the player has a hard count ie hisher best total counts an ace if any for 1 not 11 the second set of rules applies if the player has a soft count i e hisher best total includes one ace worth 11 note that a hand would never count two aces as 11 each – thats a bust of 22 if a hand has two aces and one is counted as a 1 and the other is counted as 11 then the hand both counts an ace for 1 and includes one ace worth 11 therefore it is both soft and hard under the above definitions would it be better to word it this way a soft count includes an ace counted as 11 a hard count is is everything else
student,is there a way to make the member function draw take three parameters instead of the original two or are we pretty much stuck with the original number of parameters
student,so i wrote all my code in xcode and i tested it and everything works fine but when i tried using the make file in linux the getcut function is giving me really weird numbers to shuffle at sample output from my program cut at 0 cut at 715522736 cut at 8 cut at 5 cut at 2 cut at 1 cut at 11 the weird thing is that everything works perfectly on my mac using xcode i checked and doubled checked that i copied an untouched version of randh and randcpp from the p4starters so that is definitely not the problem i submitted to the autograder and i passed all cases except for the blackjacktest00student which i am assuming is the blackjack test we are given
student,if one were to create a dynamic variable solely for use in a function parameter would there be a way to delete it or would such a strategy automatically lead to a memory leak for example void somefunctionobject o oprint int main somefunctionnew object return 0 obviously assume the class object has to have a print function and a valid constructor
student,effects writes the card to the stream for example two of spades stdostream operator stdostream os const card c should we also write a newline to the stream
student,is the autograder open for project 4 cause i cannot access it
student,i checked 1987 and the specs and still not sure i understand the purpose of expose is the concept of expose sort of like a getter function so in the driver wed expose three of the four dealt cards if i am completely mistaken can someone please clarify
student,i have a counting player that is a derived class of simple player but whenever i compile this is the error message that its giving me cannot initialize return object of type player with an rvalue of type counting what does this mean i only have one counting constructor counting is the error due to the fact that my constructor is incorrect my simple class has a default and a custom constructor
student,how do we check what the value of hand value is in our tests if it is a private member variable
student,so the spec gives us two sets of rules for simple player the first set of rules is for a player whos best total counts an ace for 1 not 11 the second set of rules is for a player whos best total counts an ace for 11 not 1 which of these two sets of rules does the player follow when they have no aces
student,i declared a couple functions for my blackjackcpp outside of main and they are all static void i define and use all of the functions but my compiler is telling my that one of my functions was declared static but never defined its just giving me a warning but how can i make this go away why would it only affect one of my multiple static void functions
student,sorry if it is already asked by someone else project4 specification says the dealer must hit until reaching seventeen or busting does it mean dealer stop as soon as his hand reaches 17 say dealer have a 3 and 10 at the beginning and when it is his turn he gets a 7 does he just stop and compare his handvalue with player
student,say i have deck d dshuffle18 dshuffle36 does this mean that the second shuffle should shuffle on top of the original shuffle18 in other words is calling shuffle36 based on the default order or is it based on the latest order in this case shuffle18
student,im trying to test my deck constructor to make sure the deck is being initialized correctly in my decktest01cpp i want to loop through each card in the deck and print each card but every combination i try it seems like i cant access next or any element in cardsdecksize ive tried doing d1deckcards0 for example but no success any tips
student,we were provided some basic tests for testing the player bet function in the playerfactorytestcpp but i am still quite confused as how to test the player draw function is it allowed for somebody to provide a super basic test case to test player draw so we can have some form of reference thank you
student,for the hand constructor what is the default value for ace is it 11soft or 1hard
student,do we exit1 thanks
student,are we allowed to just leave this one unmodified and make our test cases in 01 02 etc or should we modify the 00 one too im not entirely sure how the plagiarism checking stuff will work if we leave decktest00cpp untouched
student,if reset shuffle or deal are implemented incorrectly in the buggy code we have test i could imagine the next pointer going off the end of the cards array and this leading to a seg fault when deal is called would a seg fault on buggy code be counted as a success on the part of our testing code or would it count as a failure if it would count as a failure is there anyway to catch a seg fault and return 1 instead thanks
student,there is no maximumminimum bankroll amount listed in the spec correct so a player could potentially start with a bankroll of 0 or the game could be played for 0 hands
student,do we need to add another card in decktestnncpp when the hand value is already 21 i know the player would not ask for another card because it is already 21 but just to make sure whether we need to test for this in decktestnncpp thanks a lot
student,how do you check if the an index in the array is empty is it just initialized to 0
student,what are we supposed to be using the cardtestnncpp for the spec says we are only required to code the deck and player test files is the card test files just for our own good
student,im stuck when trying to write test cases for this class one of the private member variables that i have for simple player is hand hand but i cannot find a way to access this member variable without messing with the h file any suggestions
student,should we have any private member variables to track that
student,it says add it to the end of intvector does this mean add it to the last index of data at index 99
student,since these two function do nothing in the simple strategy do we have to implement them
student,do we have to set all the numbers in simple strategy to be const int at the beginning if that is the case what variable names should we give to them
student,are we allowed to edit the h file here similar to lab07 or should we just be coding in the playercpp also are there not supposed to be any private member variables in player because i am not quite sure how to set up a constructor without having those thank you
student,
student,im a bit confused about the linking for the testing of our individual cpp files it says that none of our individual cpp files should depend on each other but it seems like deckcpp will have to depend on cardcpp otherwise the deck wont know what a card is a previous piazza answer seemed to suggest that our cpp files dont have to literally have no external dependence we just shouldnt expect to be able to see extra helper functions we wrote in other cpp files because when each of our cpp files are tested individually the linked files will be those provided by you rather than the other cpp files we wrote i just wanted to ask again to make sure because the command that we were provided to compile deckcpp individually g ­pedantic ­wall ­werror –o1 ­c deckcpp does not include cardcpp which makes me wonder whether deckcpp isnt somehow supposed to literally have no external dependence even though it doesnt seem like this is possible
student,when adding an ace to the hand how do we know whether we want to consider it hard and add 1 to value or soft and add 11 to value do we have to consider the current value of the hand before adding it
student,the hint in the specs say that we dont have to use the public member functions and can simply edit the private member variables because we are already inside the class because its in hint does it mean that attempting to use the public member functions causes problems if so why if not why are we recommended to simply alter the private variables directly better style
student,can i include deck inside of playercpp to use in conjunction with my competitor or is this not allowed
student,if the input for const char s in playerfactory isnt simple counting or competitor what should the function do or can we assume that the input will always be one of these types
student,is it good styleshould we check representation invariants in print functions in general not just referring to the lab
student,i was wondering if somebody could point me in the right direction for writing shuffle should i copy the entire array of cards first or can the shuffling be done using a few temporary variables i just need a nudge in the right direction for starting it
student,does deck deal need to move the pointer to the next card or just return the next card because the test case says that the deal function is going to throw away a card
student,im a little confused as to how to implement the deck constructor are we supposed to create an array of 52 elements and assign each element to a card if so any hints on how to go about doing that my biggest part of being stuck in the constructor is that i have cards which is i think supposed to take arguments similar to the constructor in card but i cant figure out what to put in there thanks
student,in other words can we add getter functions to playercpp or is that ill advised because playercpp wont be used in compiling our blackjackcpp
student,how do we keep track of how many aces are in a hand if there isnt an array holding the cards in a hand are we to call another class or is using the member variables within the hand class enough
student,on page 7 the spec says to list the specific behaviors that the implementation must exhibit in at most three sentences is this just for our own benefit or something we should turn in and if we need to turn it in where should we put it thanks
student,hey i have few questions regarding project 4 1 how many players are playing is it only one player or is it one player and the dealer or is it more than that 2 it is stated that if 21 is made with an ace with a point of 11 it is called soft otherwise it is called hard what does hard means does it mean that an ace of 1 point is used to win the 21 points only or any possible combination of 21 that does not involve ace with 11 points thanks
student,i mean so it knows the entire deck and knows when to hit and stay and bets its entire bankroll because it knows exactly how to win
student,it says in the project description that the a hand will be soft if the best total counts an ace as 11 rather than a 1 im pretty sure that best total here means the highest number that isnt over 21 but i wanted to check to make sure technically you might in some cases prefer to count the ace as a 1 even if counting it as 11 wouldnt be a bust if the higher total were close enough to 21 that it would be risky to hit again but far enough away that it would be likely to lose to the dealer i am probably overthinking this but i thought it would be worth it to ask thanks
student,i would tend to think that we dont have to modify the deck array when cards are dealt but rather simply decrease the deck size however the phrasing in the rme clause for the shuffle function seems to imply that some actual reordering of the deck will be necessary which makes me think that we may have to deal from the 0th element of the deck and then shift all the other cards down in this case we would have to literally restore the deck array rather than just moving the next card pointer in addition to functionality this is also relevant for our test cases because if there is actual shifting of cards then that process could have bugs we could make test cases test for thanks
student,so i tried declaring a count variable for counting player like int count 0 however c spit out this error message playercpp10721 error nonstatic data member initializers only available with stdc11 or stdgnu11 werror what does this error message mean
student,i would like to set up a global variable to count the cards remaining since there isnt a member variable that indicates deck size is this the correct approach or am i overthinking it
student,if a simple player does not have enough money to pay the minimum wage they must pay their whole bankroll then right
student,in the driver cpp one requirement is if card remaining less than 20 we need to reshuffle the deck so my question is whether we need to reset the deck before reshuffle it or we just shuffle the deck which has been dealt
student,so in the rme for deal in deckh it says that this is being modified however when i go to use this in the deckcpp it tells me that this may only be used in a nonstatic member functionhow exactly could we go about using this for this function thanks
student,hypothetically if we wanted to use a loop to initialize our deck is there a way to cycle through the enums using an integer value i thought that there was but i dont remember for sure thanks
student,hello so i noticed we were given an exposeandcheckplayerbet function in one of the filesare we allowed to use this in our player tests or should we write our own functions to test these i dont see anything that says we cant but i just wanted to know thanks
student,or am i just overthinking this and the code would be exactly the same as deckdeck i read the other two posts on this and still am a bit confused as to what direction to go in
student,are these two functions basically the getters of the hand class all the decisions of whether an ace should be treated as 1 or 11 should be taken care of in the previous function handaddcard
student,can we
student,is there a command to make it so your compiled executables go into a subfolder in the directory youre working in
student,seeing as we dont have access to any deck how are we supposed to know when a deck is shuffled for the shuffled function when implementing the counting player
student,would somebody please give me an explanation of how the variable this works is it just a placeholder in a class that denotes the class element being worked upon
student,a question about project4 test cases it seems that we are required to submit multiple test cases for some classes so are we required to separate our tests into multiple files or we can write as many test cases in one cpp as we want in other words say we want to test 10 different cases for deckcpp do we have to write them in decktest01cpp to decktest10cpp shall we just write them in a huge decktestcpp
student,my card tests wont compile due to the overloaded operator that is supposed to allow it to cout a card to stdout am i supposed to do something with this code
student,can we assume the args passed into the driver program fulfill the required conditions or do we need to check this in our code thanks
student,i would have thought handh would have an array of cards like the hand in euchre but there is only value and soft im mainly worrying about when ill have to switch the value of an ace back and forth do i just add the card value to value
student,in the constructor in hand should we just initialize the bool soft to false
student,can count be negative should we test for count going below 0 technically count could be 20 at the least and 20 at the max right do we need to test for all of these situations thanks
student,im having some very weird behavior in my driver program i declare my rounds variable as a const but for some reason its being changed i printed out its value after every block of code that runs in my driver before the first deal takes place and its fine this includes the argv value immediately after i used atoi to convert it to an integer where it is made const etc and it remains the same however i have a function in my driver to shuffle which i call right before the first deal and immediately after i call shuffle my rounds variable is set to 0 it doesnt reference rounds at all and like i said its declared const any ideas
student,just to make sure shuffle0 shuffle52 would do nothing to the deck right
student,im just trying to get my deckcpp to compile and when i try i get an error as such with my deal function im trying to declare it as cardcard deckdeal i believe im using the right syntax trying to use card befor deckdeal but im just confused on how to fix this the error makes sense since it is a class but how else would we declare the type that deal returns without doing this
student,what can we test for card other than using get rank and get suit for different cards
student,are we allowed to create an array of cards like in project 3 in the header file to print the initialized cards
student,right now theyre public since theyre placed immediately following the class declaration without a private marker not quite sure if this is intended or not since this opens up the option of directly manipulating the contents of deck
student,in the sample file hand 2 the dealer has an ace and a three he then takes a jack and then he takes an eight he busts because his score is 22 in my output the dealer counts his ace as an 11 and busts after he picks up the jack why does the dealer count his ace as a 1 and not an 11
student,im trying to test the constructor and reset functions for deck and was wondering whether were allowed to create getters in deckscpp so that we can check whats in the cards array since we cant access private member variables directly from main or should we exclusively be using deal to figure out whats in the cards array
student,do we need to reset the deck before we reshuffle it because shuffle can work without reset im not sure which way is correct
student,when im calling my deck constructor like deck d and i step through the code the entire deck constructor is skipped over no matter where i set a breakpoint inside of the constructor stepping into the constructor results only in ending up at the final bracket of the function does anyone have an idea as to what could cause this thanks
student,im having trouble understanding what exactly it means to remove an element from an arraylike just set it up so that the numelements is one smaller or overwrite the last element in the array to be 0 or something completely different
student,the spec does not include the cardtest00cpp files among the list of files to submit or does the makefile include it in the tar file is this an oversight or is cardtest00cpp provided for our personal use not for submission then again it is a pretty simple file to implement
student,are we allowed to create new member variables like for the counting player maybe have a count member variable
student,does counting player follow the same strategy as simple player when drawing a card
student,so in the player factory function i try to create an object of each of the different players for example simpleplayer simp c is telling me simpleplayer was not declared in this scope why is that
student,why are there 0s after function declarations in the player header file and when we write out the implementations of the player functions in the derived classes will we need to keep them
student,ok im definitely making these more complicated than they need to be but what does the rme for exposed mean when it says allows the player to see the newlyexposed card c likewise what does the rme for shuffled mean when it says tells the player that the deck has been reshuffled does this simply mean that we need to cout something
student,what is the difference between container and class thanks
student,we have implemented simple player and are trying to test it but our test case file gives an error saying unknown type simple when we try to create a simple object in mainsimple s we have included playerh and we know our simple class is defined fully because creating a static simple object in playercpp works without an error what are we doing wrong thanks
student,we are provided with playertest00cpp decktest00cpp and cardtest00cpp as such should our first custom test be impltest01cpp or should we clear out the provided tests with new ones that we write ourselves
student,is there any easy way to know what a deck would look like after a shuffle for testing purposes or do we have to manually go through it and figure it out also when it says you rearrange the deck using the 1st card in right then the 1st card in left and so on are these the top cards of the deck or the at the bottom
student,i have a link error related to this effects writes the card to the stream for example two of spades stdostream operator stdostream os const card c does anyone know why this is happening thanks
student,can we write some of our test cases assuming that a certain invariant holds true for example the shuffle function will run when cardsremaining returns a value less than 20 thus resetting the cards remaining to 52 do we have to write and test a cardsremaining function that works with 0 cards left in the deck even though it will never be called with less than 19 cards remaining will our tests that we submit be expected to test for this kind of case even though it wont happen in actual game play
student,what does this mean indirection requires pointer operand const card invalid i get it when i try to make a pointer to the last card in the deck like card lastcard cards51
student,can we change wager when were playing one hand
student,when i use getrank and getsuit it gives me the rank and suit as ints when i want the name such as two of spades is there a way to do this apart from writing an enumtostring function i want to avoid this because when the other files are compiled they wont include my card class which has the enumtostring function written
student,my counting player has private int count and my competitor is a counting player class competitor counting player shouldnt this give competitor access to variable count my compiler is giving me errors regarding count being private
student,
student,is there a way to run only the unit tests on deckcpp make mytests crashes because playercpp has one or two compiler errors in it but i want to get deckcpp working before working on player
student,i used somepointer null in my project4 without include cstddef but it worked fine why it worked fine thanks by the way i later changed somepointer nullptr which still works
student,effects allocates an array of specified size and initializes each element to zero int getzeroarrayintsize int arraysize for inti0 isize i arrayi 0 return array int main int a getzeroarray3 cout a0 endl why did prof deorio say that it is undefined does int arraysize automatically go away from the stack when you exit the function does it mean that local variables may still exist even when the stack of the function is destroyed another question where does int main live in memory the stack thanks
student,if we want to add additional private member variables or additional private member functions to our classes how should we go about doing this without modifying the header files this is obviously specifically for the player derived classes for which we actually have to establish entire class structures so how should we do this especially to avoid the compiler telling us that functions are not defined
student,when i try to run make mytests i get the following error no rule to make target playertest00 needed by playertests i have not modified anything in the makefile so i was wondering what this error could mean
student,do we need to create switch statements to convert the enums for rank and suit to strings within the output operator to output to the stream
student,hey guys my compiler is giving me errors when i try to return cardsuit and cardrank from the getter functions because theyre accessing private variables when these private variables should be perfectly visible to these functions because theyre members of the card class im using codeblocks any idea what the problem here is thanks a lot
student,do we announce the total of a player or a dealers hand even when they bust or do we simply announce that they have busted
student,what should happen for the player factory if an incorrect string is entered or will this not be an issue
student,does not playing the same strategy for the competitor class mean that it can either bet differently draw differently or both
student,i dont know what im missing but for some reason the handtest00 i wrote will not compile the issue appears to be with my include statements since i get lots of code like this tmpccjgr5zvo in function main handtest00cpptext0x35 undefined reference to handhand handtest00cpptext0x49 undefined reference to cardcardcardrank cardsuit handtest00cpptext0x5d undefined reference to cardcardcardrank cardsuit handtest00cpptext0x71 undefined reference to cardcardcardrank cardsuit handtest00cpptext0x83 undefined reference to cardcardcardrank cardsuit handtest00cpptext0x90 undefined reference to handaddcardcard handtest00cpptext0x9d undefined reference to handaddcardcard handtest00cpptext0xa5 undefined reference to handhandissoft const handtest00cpptext0xcc undefined reference to handhandvalue const handtest00cpptext0xfc undefined reference to handaddcardcard handtest00cpptext0x104 undefined reference to handhandissoft const handtest00cpptext0x12b undefined reference to handhandvalue const handtest00cpptext0x15a undefined reference to handaddcardcard handtest00cpptext0x162 undefined reference to handhandvalue const handtest00cpptext0x18d undefined reference to handdiscardall handtest00cpptext0x195 undefined reference to handhandvalue const handtest00cpptext0x1bc undefined reference to handhandissoft const handtest00cpptext0x1ea undefined reference to handaddcardcard handtest00cpptext0x1f2 undefined reference to handhandvalue const handtest00cpptext0x222 undefined reference to handaddcardcard handtest00cpptext0x22a undefined reference to handhandvalue const handtest00cpptext0x252 undefined reference to handhandissoft const the undefined reference leads me to believe for some reason the cpp implementations arent available for the file i have include handcpp and include cardcpp any idea what i could be missing
student,int handvalue const effects returns the present value of the blackjack hand the highest blackjack total possible without going over 21 if the hand is over 21 any value over 21 may be returned i think i can just return value right if so why does it specify if over 21 can return any value over 21 is there any catch thanks a lot
student,can my partner and i set up a private git repository on bit bucket for working on project 4
student,in the deckshuffleint n function the specs notes us tha t if shuffle is called on a deck that has already had some cards dealt those cards should first be restored to the deck in the order in which they were dealt preserving the most recent postshuffledpostreset state but assume we have dealt 4 cards and we want to shuffle49 my understanding is that the number n needs to count from the first undeal card which is the card4 however if in this way the shuffle49 card52 gonna points to somewhere unknown how should i deal with this problem thanks
student,so weve been using the overloaded output operator but all we are outputting are the index numbers of the rank and suit that is we get 0 of 0 instead of two of spades or is that supposed to happen or are we supposed to write our own array of ranksuit names
student,what should the next pointer point to if theres no remaining cards to be dealt
student,do we need to implement functions in simple player that have no use in simpleplayer but are used in countingplayer for example expose and shuffled
student,im confused about the typedef bool unarypredicateint in lab08h for testing filter in task 4 i made a function bool filteroddint x which follows the rules for a unary predicate however im not sure where to go from here i tried doing the line of code that said unarypredicate t filterodd but it didnt work
student,any clue as to how we can get cardsremaining working i wanted to add an int cardsleft into the deck class as this would make all work calculating and returning cardsremaining very simple but this would violate the spec any hints
student,i have two questions 1 for playertest do we only have to test the behavior of counting player or do we need to make tests for the simple player and competitor too also when we are testing for player can we assume the player factory function correctly returns the counting player 2 does it matter how long our test cases take to run
student,i am imported cardh into cardcpp i am getting compile errors that rank and suit dont name a type when i try to return values of those types the enums for the types are declared in the header file anyone know why this is happening any suggestions as to a solution
student,
student,what does this line from the spec mean you may use global state in the class implementations but it must be static and except for the three players const
student,do we have to reshuffle the deck if it gets below 20 while the dealer deals cards
student,for functions that say to modify this do we just change what this points to like for reset i have next card0 obviously the modifies clause says it modifies this so id just have to say thisnext right
student,essentially we supposed to create completely new files cardcpp playercpp handcpp so is there a template we can follow and are we not allowed to use using namespace std
student,note if shuffle is called on a deck that has already had some cards dealt those cards should first be restored to the deck in the order in which they were dealt preserving the most recent postshuffledpostreset state what does preserving the most recent postshuffledpostreset state mean
student,does the counting player is exactly the simpler player plus a more complexed betting i am confused if i am right can i derive counting players class from simple players one
student,i was wondering if the instructors would be doing an exam review for the final similar to the midterm and if so what day that would be i know it is a little ridiculous that i am asking now but you guys knew it would be very helpful i am planning out my schedule and definitely wouldnt want to miss the review thanks
student,im working on tests for my counting player specifically for betting and i was wondering if we need to test for busting if so how do we show successfailure
student,at the end of lecture it is mentioned that this implementation of remove has on timing why isnt it o1isnt just one swap required
student,i see multiple functions within the project that modify this when i wrote my functions for these files i assumed that it meant this class as in this class member variables but here on piazza ive seen this was my original interpretation correct or am i missing something major if this is some kind of variable where is it declared
student,i apologize if this question is already asked in lecture 14 when using intset as interface we only have pure virtual functions in intset we do not have a constructor why do we omit constructor here if we add a line intset under the public will there be any compiling errors or other issues
student,rank cardgetrank const return rank this is all i have and ive included cardh why does c tell me that ranksuit does not name a type
student,what if the variables used in the factory function are not declared static you can still see it in the main as long as you include the cpp file correct then why do we need to make it static
student,in blackjackcpp when there are fewer than 20 cards do we print shuffling and then all the cuts before announcing the hand number or after
student,in a previous post one instructor says we cannot use ctor but i think reset would be a lot like the ctor so can we assign a new deck ie deck to this thanks
student,if we have a function that technically modifies a variable outside the function but then it always changes that variable pack to its original value before the function returns so that the function effectively doesnt modify anything should we still have a modifies clause for that for instance consider this rather contrived example int getnextint x x return x yes i know x doesnt need to be passed by reference this is just for the sake of example here x gets modified inside the function but it gets restored to its original value before the function returns furthermore since int is a builtin fundamental type theres no extra code ie overloaded operators that could possibly run on either the x or the return x lines so the function behaves in all cases as if it never modified x at all so should the rme for this function be effects returns x 1 or modifies x effects returns x 1
student,ive been using the template provided by cardtest00cpp to make test cases but im not able to compile cardtest00cpp because i have an undefined reference to the operator when trying to print cards what should i do here
student,if a function is in a class of type of deck and no return type is declared is the return variable of the function the same as the class type ex deck for deckdeck
student,we were wondering how to test dcardsremaining from deckcpp with the starting test code in decktest00cpp we believe that the dcardsreminaing should return 49 starting deck size of 52 and then three calls to ddeal is this correct
student,would the value of soft changed during play like if currently its treated as 11 but then dealt another card maybe the player will have a greater chance to win if the ace is treated as 1 now will it change to 1 because it looks like that we cant keep track of what cards player has in hand also whats the point of handissoft since there is no array of cards to memorize what cards player has it seems like this function will only be called in addcard
student,are we allowed to edit header files for this project i would like to add some functions to make debugging easier and also possibly a few helper functions in some of the classes
student,i know that it should go to playerh but since we dont always get to modify h file i just want to make sure where it should go in this project
student,the spec says do not write code that contains interfile dependencies i dont really understand what you mean by this for an example does this mean that i cant call a function thats in another file
student,spec says that if the player is dealt a natural 21 the players get paid off without examining the dealers cards but then on the second following paragraph it says that the player and dealer could both be dealt natural 21s my question is that if the player finds out that she has a natural 21 then she choose to stand then dealer still needs to play but when comparing totals theres no need to check dealers right and if both of them get a total of 21 but not a natural 21 player still wins and the player doesnt get paid off 32 in this case
student,i think i understand the general rules of blackjack but i dont really understand what goes in to the strategies for counting and simple players when implementing competitor do i need to create something significantly better or does it only need to perform a bit better than the others also will there be any office hours or other ways to understand blackjack strategies better so that we can make a better competitor
student,are we allowed to use dynamic memory variable length arrays to implement functions for example my current implementation of deckshuffle uses vlas to keep track of the left and right halves of the deck while shuffling
student,first page regarding dealing the first faceup to the player the second faceup to himself the third faceup to the player the fourth facedown to himself that leaves the player with two faceup cards is this right
student,if the dealer gets an ace does he get to decide if the ace counts as a 1 or 11 in the same way as the player
student,the spec says we can include other libraries to help our competitor class make decisions and that we should ask the instructors when we want to add a new library can i include the vector and map libraries
student,how do we know what the minimum wager is supposed to be
student,does the counting player follow the same rules as simple for whether to hit or stand
student,is there anyway to track the players hand and bankroll within the actual class i cant really see how this could occur unless new functions were added to the derived classes of player is this allowed or would we just track these values within blackjackcpp
student,im unsure as to why this error is happening or what could be causing it it doesnt specify any lines of code where it is happening either but im pretty sure its happening where i call a card constructor does anyone know why an error like this happens
student,we have to write playertest files and i assume well have to write tests for the simple and counting players but since the staff wont have a buggy version of our own competitor are we required to test our own competitor player for points
student,when player hit after 4 cards dealt by dealer do we need to print something like player dealt xxxx of xxxx thanks
student,when you reset the deck before shuffling isnt it a different type of reset than deckreset from what i understand the reseting in shuffle puts the cards back on the deck as if they hadnt been dealt but deckreset completely reorders the cards to be a new deck is this correct
student,are we allowed to say declare our own functions that we are using across classes in the header file of some class and then just implement the function once or can we create our own library of sorts instead of redundantly copying functions across our cpp files for instance i want to create a function that returns the value of a card based on a rank and this could easily be used in hand and player
student,in the addcard function in the hand class does the function decide whether an ace should be treated as a 1 or 11 for example if an ace is added and would cause the value to go over 21 if it was 11 does the function only increment value by 1 otherwise where would this decision be made
student,bash41 g wall werror o1 pedantic canvascpp shapescpp lab07cpp lab07 usrbinld cannot find lab07 collect2 ld returned 1 exit status when i compile the lab in the terminal i get this error message im not sure what it means and how i should fix it could someone please help me thank you
student,im confused by the wording about how the shuffle function works if cards have already been dealt namely what it means by the cards already dealt must be restored to the deck in the order they were dealt since when cards are dealt the order of the cards in the array is unchanged does this mean that you should start shuffling normally starting from the location of next for instance if say all but 2 cards of a newly opened deck had been dealt and you call shuffle4 then the resulting deck will have king diamonds four spades ace diamonds five spades two spades six spades three spades seven spades etc or is next reset to the beginning of the deck before shuffling
student,if i have an array of pointers to ellipse objects ellipse a2 why cant i use shape s a
student,i am implementing the draw function for the rectangle class and i am getting an error that this is a redefinition of draw what am i doing wrong here
student,hello i missed my discussion section this week and i wanted to know if there would be a way to get my midterm back because of this i cant seem to find my discussion instructors email on the syllabus or website so i would like some help please
student,title says it all
student,no default constructor exists for class ellipse flagged on my circle constructor do i need to create a default constructor for ellipse or did i do something wrong
student,about how much of a curve can we expect for the class
student,can one of the upcoming labs be using labster and subclasses i think it would help me understand what is really going on
student,im sorry i have to ask this i didnt change the time in my calendar its 2 hours before the original time for the final correct
student,i failed to pass all the test cases so how can i know where i made the mistakes can we have those test cases ourselves
student,how will project 3 be graded as in what is the breakdown autograder hand grade checkpoint grade and how many points for each aspect also does the handgrade only grade for style or does it also give some partial credit within the code itself
student,my partner and i both tried to submit at about 1150 tonight and he managed to submit our latest copy but my ctoolsautograder kept saying no project to show giving me an empty scroll menu are we still okay if he submitted and mine couldnt get through who should i email about this
student,so i run my program and it runs exactly as expected but when i run diff it says there are differences when the files are visually identical when i click though the out file which i produce i find something i have never seen before on a computer it requires two clicks of the arrow keys to move the cursor one spot but only at the end of the names of cathy and alice literally everything else it spot on and i have run almost 100 tests so i am confident the rest works is my computer broken
student,does our main function in euchrecpp need to have an rme
student,i heard a rumor that the autograder runs out test cases with our buggy code to see if it catches the bugs is this true
student,hey everybody my shuffle function is being called in gamecpp but it doesnt seem to be doing anything to the pack does anybody have any idea why this might be im referring to the pack with packshufflegameptrpack is there a reason that wouldnt work for modifying the pack thanks in advance
student,ive been grinding away at what i thought would be the last steps of this project for about 12 hours now and my code runs into a segmentation fault when i have more than one hand in play my out has the following in the second hand hand 0 alice deals jack of diamonds turned up bob passes passes passes alice passes bob orders up hearts the way i designed the function this shouldnt happen with players at all because my indices wrap around also they start playing with twos and dont see any twos in packin please help
student,bash41 make tar make no rule to make target tar stop
student,hello we were given the code return asuit aranksuitsize bsuit branksuitsize initially to compare cards however when it compares an ace of spades and a jack of spades hearts being trump it returns the jack of spades as being bigger than the ace of spades and we cant figure out why this is happening
student,if youre still working keep it up you can do the thing
student,ive had no problem compilingrunning on linux and no differences have come up when i run diff check commands for euchre test00 and 01 there are no differences however the autograder gave me the print out below after the other tests and i have no idea whats going wrong i considered the idea that the files got messed up when i transferred them using mfile im clueless thanks in advance for any help test case euchretest00 failed to compile euchretest00 04 test case euchretest01 failed to compile euchretest01 04
student,hello i am trying to find style guidelines in google drive but i couldnt could someone let me know where it is thanks in advance
student,i am attempting to submit a targz file to the autograder and it keeps telling me that it cannot find any of my cpp files this is incredibly frustrating because when i unzip the same folder that i uploaded i can see that all of those files are there any advice
student,could someone please give me some guidance on how to test the pack functions from looking at other piazza posts i can see that we are not supposed to create another packin file but i am having trouble seeing how i can test the pack functions without creating a different pack file with a different ordering of cards thanks
student,do we need to cout the argv arguments like in the eurchretest correct files
student,just to be totally clear we do not need to write any test cases for euchrecpp or gamecpp or creating xxxxxin pack files of known card order and running them against what you think the answer should be ie playing out a hand using physical cards is sufficient testing id greatly appreciate an answer without a link to a different post thank you
student,tested my proj up to 1000 points for shuffle just to see if i was running into segfaults and i wasnt when i am testing with noshuffle though i run into a segfaul what could be happening is it a problem with my shuffle commented the line called shuffle out but still ran into the segfault alice and cathy win the hand euchred alice and cathy have 2 points bob and drew have 0 points hand 1 bob deals segmentation fault 11
student,i know that style is graded only on the last partner to submits code but is the function testing the same or are both partners functions tested do the partners receive the higher of the two grades
student,so whenever i run the code i get this bash41 euchre packin shuffle 10 alice bob cathy drew hand 0 deals segmentation fault is there a way to find and debug this
student,is it bad if my final submit is taking an extremely long time in the autograder many other submits come and go while mine is still running
student,i wrote like 20 helper functions should i put them all at the top or near as i can to the various functions that use them i have helper functions that use other helpersmy gameplay is not long at all because i broke everything up into a bunch of functions thanks
student,this is really frustrating me because everything matches the two given example correct test cases except for the very end at the end of my output is this of course i use variables for the names but just to show cout alice and cathy win endl now this passes test 00 but then test 01 fails even though im couting the same thing cout bob and drew win endl now when i add an extra endl to both of those test 01 fails and test 00 passes why is this how do i fix this thank you so much in advance
student,how do we test the game functions gameinit and gameplay i ran it with different inputs in the command line but im not sure how to turn it in thanks
student,i have a helper function in gamecpp where i pass my array of players i know the instructions say to pass large structs by pointer but does the array need to be a pointer as well or is it fine to simply pass the player
student,if trump is diamonds and the led suit is hearts and a player is supposed to play the highest nontrump card in their hand can they play the jack of hearts because that is the same as the led suit or does jack of hearts count as trump in this scenario and therefore a different card should be played
student,so when i am trying to run euchre in linux it is telling me that stoi was not declared in this scope and i have include string at the top of euchrecpp i wasnt sure if there was something else that i needed to include or if there was another reason that i could be getting this error
student,so im getting this message when i use diff in makefile files euchretest00out and euchretest00outcorrect differ it doesnt tell me exactly where they differdoes this mean they are different or because nothing else outputted its fine sorry its silly question
student,i am trying to create a cstring with many letters so i am trying to put the many letters onto multiple lines my code currently basically looks like char longword aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa however when i try to compile the code i get the message error deprecated conversion from string constant to char how can i fix this thanks in advance
student,i know we are supposed to submit our own tests for all the functions we wrote but im not sure where to put our tests for the gamecpp functions any insight would be appreciated thanks
student,what does a cout fall under effects or modifies
student,do we have to restate the rems for fncs in the cpp files if they are declared in the h file with an rem
student,“he the dealer then discards the lowest card among his hand and the turnup for a final total of 5 cards” does this mean that the dealer can reject the turnup card i thought he must pick it up
student,do we need to declare area and draw in circle or we can just use these functions from ellipse
student,in hand 2 of euchretest01 cathy orders up spades so her hand should be a of clubs a of spades j of spades k of diamonds k of spades when it comes time for her to play on the first trick the leading suit was hearts but as she has no hearts she should play the lowest card in this case the lowest card would be the k of diamonds but the correct output has the a of clubs as her play why is this
student,if we got a full score on the autograder 1414 do we need to write anymore test cases doesnt this mean that the functionality of our files passes the extensive tests written into the autograder i know there are some similar posts to this one but i just wanted some clarification
student,i admit i didnt get around to learning how to use the file transfer methods instead i use virtualsites to reach my network drive so i can see my files and folders visually i would copy and paste my files there and then run commands with putty for compiling and testing my projects but now my network drive doesnt show up anymore even after restarting my connection a few times anyone know what network drive it is or how i can reestablish a connection thank you in advance
student,when we created our own tests for packtests we created our own pack to read in but since the makefile doesnt send the our own packs to the autograder if someone ran our packtests they would get a file not found error is this ok or is there some way to send our packs in with the autograder thanks
student,does anyone have any idea as to why this would happen and potential ways to fix it i saw a previous answer on piazza but i didnt really get much out of it
student,i created a new packin file which i open in my packtestcpp and then i do all my testing on that pack the pack isnt in the final tar and therefore my tests wouldnt work should i redo all my testing or is the grade just based on the presence of test cases it doesnt seem very effective to repeat the tests on the same pack ie packinit packreset
student,do we always cout the inputs even if the program is supposed to exit for example if the inputs were euchre packin shuffle 0 a b c d should we exit immediately or output euchre packin shuffle 0 a b c d and then exit
student,say you have the upcard as jack of spades the player has jack of clubs in their hand which is technically a spade in the second round they would order up clubs if given the chance correct
student,good evening i have a large problem that after running my deal function which works other than this error after the deal the 9 of spades is my upcard the pack doesnt save the pointer location after the deal has anybody else had this problem or can anyone help offer insight thank you for your help in advance
student,in hand 0 when alice order up diamonds why doesnt she add the ace of diamonds to her hand and discard the her lowest card
student,does it make sense to have a test case where the orderupsuit is different from the upcard suit thanks
student,is it acceptable to write loops in this style like for int i 0 i length i fctnptr i with appropriate assumed info ie fctn takes in some pointer ptr is declared already theres no segfault problems i found this way more convenient for some parts of the project will i lose points for doing this or is it okay
student,lets say the illegal pack was named packillegalin should the output be euchre packillegalin noshuffle 5 alice bob cathy drew error opening packillegalin or just error opening packillegalin
student,are we allowed to use printf to print some of the cstring thanks
student,if a player only has a two of clubs and a two of spades and the leading card was a five of spades with trump being clubs which card would the player put down is the order of the suits trump the suit of the leading card and then the rest are determined by diamonds first then clubs hearts and spades
student,player 1 hand nine of spades ten of spades jack of spades king of hearts ace of hearts player 2 hand queen of spaces king of spades nine of clubs ten of clubs jack of clubs player 3 hand ace of spades nine of hearts ten of hearts queen of clubs king of clubs player 4 hand jack of hearts queen of hearts ace of clubs nine of diamonds ten of diamonds upcard jack of diamonds according to the spec in this situation player two would order up hearts during the second round can someone please explain why this is true
student,we are not exactly sure what this means if we make the tests individually make playertests they are working and the code is compiling but it does not work when we use make test
student,hey everybody im in the final debugging process for the project but im having some problems when it comes to printing suits as it stands right now im using the following to get suit gameptrpacknextsuit although when put into a cout statement this prints a number how can i get this to print the suit instead thank you for your help in advance
student,your hand nine of spades jack of spades jack of diamonds ace of spades ace of hearts is the led card and trump suit is clubs what should be played
student,for the adddiscard fnc i was wondering what would happen if the ordered up card was jack of spades would the trump suit be spades or would it be clubs i guess this applies to making trump too as in if the upcard is jack of spades would you only consider spades in your hand or also clubs
student,in lab07 i declared a custom constructor for class circle public ellipse which takes in a single double since the constructor needs to initialize xrad to radin and yrad to radin i want to call the custom constructor of its parent class ellipse so i just call ellipseradin radin however the compiler says no default constructor exists for class ellipse why do i need a default constructor for its parent class thanks a lot
student,this is probably a silly question but i just wanted to double check before my final submit in order to make sure euchrecpp outputs the correct error message and exits at the right time if the filename is wrong i have it open the filestream in euchre before cardcpp is called to make sure the filename is correct and then close it right afterwards so long as i get full points on the autograder will this cause any other issues with autograding
student,hi could someone please give me a sanity check on my understanding of cardcompare when there is a trump suit and a led suit thank you in advance rank of cards from biggest to smallest trump clubs lead suit spades jack of clubs jack of spades ace of clubs king of clubs queen of clubs 10 of clubs 9 of clubs ace of spades ace of hearts ace of diamonds king of spades king of hearts king of diamonds queen of spades queen of hearts queen of diamonds etc
student,can anyone tell me what this means i got it when i modified my playerleadcard function
student,im not sure whats going wrong my code compiled on the autograder and i make a couple fixes to my gamecpp that shouldnt affect it it compiles when i compile on caen with the terminal but the autograder is giving me test case euchretest00 failed to compile euchretest00 04 test case euchretest01 failed to compile euchretest01 04
student,we are testing game and we are not sure what our player should do for this scenario suppose that clubs is trump and jack of spades is led if our player has queen of diamonds 10 of clubs what should our player play
student,i printed out the dealers hand after all the cards are dealt and hisher cards are correct during round 1 of making trump inside the playeraddand discard function i print out the dealers cards again first thing done in the function but the cards are all 2 of spades i print the dealers cards a 3rd time after making trump has been finished and the cards go back to how they originally were before dealing the upcard wasnt picked up if it was supposed to be how do i solve this issue of the random 2 of spades showing up
student,what happens if you try to convert the empty string to a cstring or if you try to initialize a cstring to the empty string literal does it work as expected so would both of these string s const char c scstr and const char c work because theres a nullterminating character and so c is still pointing to something thanks
student,when testing against euchretest00outcorrect i get the following output is there some reason why alice leads two of spades and are the rest of my other mismatches just cascading errors of the alices leading card mismatch hand 0 alice deals jack of diamonds turned up bob passes cathy passes drew passes alice passes bob orders up hearts jack of spades led by bob king of spades played by cathy ace of spades played by drew nine of diamonds played by alice drew takes the trick king of clubs led by drew ace of clubs played by alice nine of spades played by bob jack of clubs played by cathy alice takes the trick two of spades led by alice ten of spades played by bob queen of spades played by cathy queen of clubs played by drew cathy takes the trick ten of clubs led by cathy nine of hearts played by drew queen of hearts played by alice king of hearts played by bob bob takes the trick ace of hearts led by bob nine of clubs played by cathy ten of hearts played by drew jack of hearts played by alice alice takes the trick alice and cathy win the hand euchred alice and cathy have 2 points bob and drew have 0 points the correct output hand 0 alice deals jack of diamonds turned up bob passes cathy passes drew passes alice passes bob orders up hearts jack of spades led by bob king of spades played by cathy ace of spades played by drew nine of diamonds played by alice drew takes the trick king of clubs led by drew ace of clubs played by alice nine of spades played by bob jack of clubs played by cathy alice takes the trick ten of diamonds led by alice ten of spades played by bob nine of clubs played by cathy queen of clubs played by drew alice takes the trick jack of hearts led by alice ace of hearts played by bob ten of clubs played by cathy ten of hearts played by drew alice takes the trick queen of hearts led by alice king of hearts played by bob queen of spades played by cathy nine of hearts played by drew bob takes the trick alice and cathy win the hand euchred alice and cathy have 2 points bob and drew have 0 points
student,i got my program to compile and output the correct results for one of the public test cases on visual studio upon moving to caen the entire output got changed other team won 10 multiple players played the same card in different tricks other issues and after a little bit of fixing its now returned a segfault to compile on visual studio i did have to change all strcpy to strcpys and change the cstring library in packcpp to string but i cant figure out why all of a sudden it freaks out here is what valgrind outputs for the first test case bash41 valgrind euchre packin noshuffle 1 alice bob cathy drew 6724 memcheck a memory error detector 6724 copyright c 20022012 and gnu gpld by julian seward et al 6724 using valgrind381 and libvex rerun with h for copyright info 6724 command euchre packin noshuffle 1 alice bob cathy drew 6724 euchre packin noshuffle 1 alice bob cathy drew hand 0 alice deals jack of diamonds turned up bob passes cathy passes drew passes alice passes bob orders up hearts jack of spades led by bob 6724 conditional jump or move depends on uninitialised values 6724 at 0x402a02 playerplaycardplayer card const suit playercpp139 6724 by 0x401ff2 trickgame player int suit gamecpp243 6724 by 0x401652 gameplaygame gamecpp79 6724 by 0x40130f main euchrecpp60 6724 king of spades played by cathy ace of spades played by drew nine of diamonds played by alice drew takes the trick king of clubs led by drew 6724 use of uninitialised value of size 8 6724 at 0x403241 cardprintcard const cardcpp50 6724 by 0x402002 trickgame player int suit gamecpp244 6724 by 0x401652 gameplaygame gamecpp79 6724 by 0x40130f main euchrecpp60 6724 6724 use of uninitialised value of size 8 6724 at 0x403251 cardprintcard const cardcpp50 6724 by 0x402002 trickgame player int suit gamecpp244 6724 by 0x401652 gameplaygame gamecpp79 6724 by 0x40130f main euchrecpp60 6724 6724 invalid read of size 8 6724 at 0x403251 cardprintcard const cardcpp50 6724 by 0x402002 trickgame player int suit gamecpp244 6724 by 0x401652 gameplaygame gamecpp79 6724 by 0x40130f main euchrecpp60 6724 address 0x3427ea0 is not stackd mallocd or recently freed 6724 6724 6724 process terminating with default action of signal 11 sigsegv 6724 access not within mapped region at address 0x3427ea0 6724 at 0x403251 cardprintcard const cardcpp50 6724 by 0x402002 trickgame player int suit gamecpp244 6724 by 0x401652 gameplaygame gamecpp79 6724 by 0x40130f main euchrecpp60 6724 if you believe this happened as a result of a stack 6724 overflow in your programs main thread unlikely but 6724 possible you can try to increase the size of the 6724 main thread stack using the mainstacksize flag 6724 the main thread stack size used in this run was 10485760 6724 6724 heap summary 6724 in use at exit 0 bytes in 0 blocks 6724 total heap usage 8 allocs 8 frees 8949 bytes allocated 6724 6724 all heap blocks were freed no leaks are possible 6724 6724 for counts of detected and suppressed errors rerun with v 6724 use trackoriginsyes to see where uninitialised values come from 6724 error summary 6 errors from 4 contexts suppressed 6 from 6 segmentation fault
student,i am trying to make the loop for gameplay but its making like 50000 hands for each game right now my loop condition checks if the partnerships of both scores is below pointsneededtowin do partners win if they get more than the needed points or only when they have exactly the amount of points needed
student,so just to be sure since the make finaltar command doesnt include any game test files we do not have to turn those in right therefore the only test functions we will be graded on are the ones we wrote for card pack and player correct
student,what are we supposed to enter into the terminal when we try to find errors in game with gdb or valgrind since there are many files that are being utilized here what exactly is the correct one to be testing is it test from the makefile
student,how many submissions do we have i have a partner by the way but we forgot how to check our remaining times of submission a detailed answer will be really appreciated thanks
student,is it alright if we print statements from anyall of the files playercpp cardcpp packcpp or are we only allowed to print from gamecpp im not sure if this might have something to do with the linking change in the autograder the other day thanks
student,when a side marched which exactly is being printed out march or marched thank you
student,i ran my code in xcode and it worked fine but in the terminal on mac and now on caen computers it keeps giving me a segfault but only when i do the noshuffle option when i do shuffle it compiles and the output is 100 right diff says its the same no clue whats wrong
student,im having trouble with implementing this i can get the right cards played when the eldest hand starts leading but after that trick i can get the next lead right and that is it any tips
student,output jack of diamonds led by alice ten of clubs played by bob queen of clubs played by cathy jack of hearts played by drew alice takes the trick if drews hand is jack of hearts ten of diamonds nine of diamonds and diamonds is ordered up in the first round of making trump shouldnt jack play 10 of diamonds if a player can follow suit he plays the highest card that follows suit why would drew play jack of hearts
student,so lets say alice has a king of hearts and a jack of heats diamonds is trump and the lead card is an ace of hearts alice can follow the lead suit and she should put down the king of hearts and not the jack of hearts because thats technically a diamond correct
student,everything is working fine in xcode is there a reason why the files arent compiling when we put them through the autograder this is the feedback we got please take a moment to verify that the contents of the attached submission archive are what you intended to submit you can extract the archive with the following command mkdir p tmp tar c tmp xzvf submissiontargz this will create a directory called tmp and extract the archive into that directory submission results for kayoonj hayterji test case results cardtest00 11 test case cardtests failed to compile cardtests 01 packtest00 11 test case packtests failed to compile packtests 01 playertest00 11 test case playertests failed to compile playertests 01 euchretest00 04 euchretest01 04
student,are we expected to test the functions that were given to us or just the ones we modifiedmade
student,when i pass arguments to xcode by editing the project scheme it appears to work fine except the filepath is always the first argument xcode passes to the shell even though i dont specify it as that this results in all the argvs being off by one which is a real pain to change when i go to test the code on caen any idea how to fix this
student,this is the output when i try to compile my euchrecpp function bash41 make euchre g euchrecpp o euchre tmpccwyoxjco in function main euchrecpptext0x321 undefined reference to gameinitgame char const bool int char const const euchrecpptext0x330 undefined reference to gameplaygame collect2 ld returned 1 exit status make euchre error 1 bash41 what could be going wrong here i saw the other posts about what to do with an undefined reference error and that did not work i have quadruple checked that all of my includes are correct and that all of my files are named correctly thanks
student,lets say that one team has 9 points in a game to 10 points another hand is played and that team euchres the other team giving them 2 points should i print that they have 11 points thus winning or should i just cap it at the max points and print that they have 10
student,can we use strings as compared to cstrings when reading from the args list in euchrecpp i know its stated that we can use strings when reading from files but i wasnt sure if this counted
student,does the player that orders up trump lead the trick or does the player to the left lead the trick also when a player makes trump do we end the hand as in does a player lead a trick the moment one of the players makes trump or do we continue the trump making process for all two rounds even if one of the players already made trump earlier
student,when i try to run packtests and playertests both give me the following blank line and bash41 does not reappear does anyone have any idea why it is doing this thanks
student,what is the best way to compare a player referenced by a player pointer to a player in the array of players in the game struct without using their names ive tried this with names and it works fine with some tests but im afraid that this will cause some confusion and our program may not work properly all the time when ive tried comparing them by the cards in their hands we encountered many seg faults is there another better way to do this or am i missing something
student,for some reason the output of my program does not change even if i change my code via functions if i add a cout statement in the middle of my gameplay i see the statement but if i were to add a function in my case printhand that im using for debugging purposes the function does nothing ive tried this with several different types functions that take no parameters and just cout and still nothing any idea why the eecs devil has cursed me
student,during the second round of making trump a player orders up if they have one or more face cards of the suit opposite of the upcard does the bower count for this for example if the upcard is clubs and someone has no clubs in their hand but the jack of spades do they order up during second round of making
student,i understand that when euchre packin shuffle 10 alice bob cathy drew extraname usage euchre packfilename shufflenoshuffle pointstowin name1 name2 name3 name4 should be outputted before the system exits however if an invalid pack is entered euchre nonexistentpackin shuffle 10 alice bob cathy drew should the output be usage euchre packfilename shufflenoshuffle pointstowin name1 name2 name3 name4 error opening nonexistentpackin or just error opening nonexistentpackin
student,since enums cannot be static i must ask can i create a new enum type in project 3
student,we have sent our final project on sunday and get full score on autograder but we get 0 point on euchretest0004 why this happened same file but for the different result
student,i submitted project 3 on sunday and i got 1414 today i tried to submit the identical file and only get 614 my test 00 and test 11 failed i downloaded my submission file from auto grader email the auto grader must have been changed
student,im confused about the return value im getting from int cardcompareconst card a const card b card a is the queen of hearts and card b is the ten of clubs obviously clubs is greater than hearts however i get a return value of positive 7 why is this the case thanks
student,after hours and hours of debugging other stuff i came across the following error when doing the diff test the output files look identical to the eye but i get these differences im not sure what this means any quick helpsuggestions
student,euchretest00 are and euchretest01 are both failing to compile on the autograder we have made sure all header files were not altered by adding the original header files to the project and have also made sure packcpp includes only packh besides the libraries playercpp includes playerh etc what else could be the problem thank you
student,when passing in the arguments euchre packin shuffle x alice bob cathy drew bob and drew always win and have a score double of alice and cathy no matter the value for x and when passing in the arguments euchre packin noshuffle x alice bob cathy drew alice and cathy always win with a score of two more than bob and drew is this correct because of the nature of the shuffle
student,could someone please confirm if what im thinking is correct lets say diamonds is trump ace of hearts is led by a nine of hearts is played by b ten of hearts is played by c jack of hearts is played by d should player d take the trick because the jack of hearts is the left bower thanks
student,me and my partner made a new pack and were testing if our gamecpp still works but we are kind of confused what should happen in these scenerios suppose if alice has these cards queen of clubs jack of spades king of hearts ace of hearts ten of hearts where clubs is trump for the first round we get this output ace of spades led by cathy nine of spades played by drew jack of spades played by alice king of spades played by bob alice takes the trick however since jack of spades is a left bower should that card be considered as a club in another scenario if alice has jack of spades king of hearts ace of hearts queen of hearts where clubs is trump we get this output jack of clubs led by cathy king of clubs played by drew queen of hearts played by alice nine of hearts played by bob cathy takes the trick however shouldnt alice play the jack of spades since she needs to follow suit and a left bower is technically a club thank you so much
student,what is supposed to print if the team that orders up wins 0 tricks and the other team wins all 5 tricks ie they are euchered and marched at the same time in real euchre this would never happen but how should our program handle this situation
student,everything runs fine on my first two loops but then on the third one things get weird the names of my players disappear deals and shortly after the program crashes with a segmentation fault what could be going on these names are really causing problems for me
student,please correct me if im mistaken in eurchretest01outcorrect hand0 trick 3 jack of diamonds led by alice ten of clubs played by bob queen of clubs played by cathy jack of hearts played by drew alice takes the trick diamonds is the led suit unless my dealing is messed up drew at this point has jhearts 10diamonds 9diamonds in his hand according to playerplaycard he should play the highest card that follow suit diamondsif he has diamonds in his hand or play the lowest card in his hand so knowing this why does he play the jhearts and not the 10diamonds
student,is lab07cpp supposed to only print circles area or ellipses area too what is the correct output
student,for pack tests what packin is the autograder going to be using the provided test case is card c packdealonepack assert cardcomparec ninespades 0 but for the autograder im not sure what to assert that the card c should be equal is the autograder going to using packin
student,i know that we need to write at least one extra test case per function for submission but i am confused how you can do a second test case for packreset given we cant submit another pack we also call packreset in our shuffle function so i am not sure what else we can do
student,hello we were finishing tonight and we noticed people in our project were playing seven of spades which doesnt even exist in a euchre deck where could i have possibly gone wrong or where some common errors which might cause this thanks
student,is it okay to have magic numbers if we include comments that describe what the numbers mean for instance we use magic numbers in our deal function to do the 3 2 3 2 2 3 2 3 deal pattern i think adding constant ints would just make the code uglier
student,like i said my partner and i passed the two given outcorrect files but is there an easier way to test to see if our project completely works without physically writing out hands of euchre
student,is it illegal to call cardinit like so cardinitcard playerleadcardrank playerleadcardsuit i keep getting a seg fault at this point in my code
student,packshufflegameptrpack packresetgameptrpack these two lines of code work in visual both 00 and 01 are correct to my eye when i run 01 through caen the pack does not shuffle hand 0 is fine but hand 1 and the rest are not my initial shuffle is done in gameinit and i suppose that is why hand 0 is not having any problems
student,since make finaltar dosnt take in make final how do you guys see our regression test we are required to make
student,i passed 1001 in my euchre packin 1001 names names names names command it worked just fine it seems like atoi truncates the 1 am i supposed to make sure that this 1001 does not work thanks
student,her hand consists of jh qh ac 9d 10d the trump suit is hearts and the led suit is spades cardcompare should return card value order as trump led d c h s hearts spades diamonds clubs playerplaycard should return the highest card in led suit or lowest card in nonled suit ac 9d 10d jh qh by priority not by value therefore alice should play the ace of clubs before the nine of diamonds where is the mistake in my reasoning
student,when i run make test there does not seem to be any errors in euchretest00out and euchretest00outcorrect however when i use diff between the two files there are multiple errors but only in lines that print with the first persons name there are no visible differences there is not even a change when using w with the diff function when i tried changing the name of the first person to abby the first name then became abby for some reason i have no idea what is wrong
student,do we need to concern ourselves if the argument for points to win game is a decimal if command is greater than 8 for example when testing our test case we use the command euchre packin shuffle 10 alice bob cathy drew euchre test00out diff euchretest1outcorrect euchretest00out this will fail the test case when number of arguments is greater than 8 do we need to be concerned about this
student,in my project when compiling wall throws an error because i may have unused variables in my function i have been compiling with out wall and everything is fine just need to know if u guys use wall when testing our projects
student,why does bob lead the first trick with a jack of spades w trump being hearts per the specs when a player leads a trick he plays the highest non­trump card in his hand by highest card we go by suit first then rank using the debugger in my ide i know that bobs hand has the following nine spades ten spades jack spades king hearts ace hearts since the highest suit is hearts and since ace is the highest heart he has shouldnt bob lead with ace of hearts
student,drew has to lead because he won the last trick drew has these cards jack of hearts king of diamonds queen of diamonds ten of clubs is it correct to assume that drew would lead with the ten of clubs or would he lead with the jack of hearts thank you in advance
student,what is the output if pointstowin is 101 is it just usage euchre packfilename shufflenoshuffle pointstowin name1 name2 name3 name4 or euchre packin noshuffle 101 a b c d usage euchre packfilename shufflenoshuffle pointstowin name1 name2 name3 name4 thanks a lot
student,ive read several other posts about how tests are graded and i just want to be clear if i have a correct test for every function in addition to those given to us will i receive full credit im fully aware that the more tests the better i just want to know the grading standard
student,do i have to make a similar files to packin in order to create more test cases for pack packinit in particular
student,my project keeps giving me this segmentation fault program received signal sigsegv segmentation fault im not sure how to find where this is occuringwhat to do to fix it
student,hi all just wonder are we allowed to use break or staticcast in project3
student,in the spec it says if a player can follow suit he plays the highest card that follows suit otherwise he plays the lowest card in his hand does the lowest card account for trump
student,i created a card array to hold all of the lead cards in a players hand to determine the highest card of the lead suit i was able to compile my program in xcode however it gives me the following error when attempting to compile in g playercpp191 error iso c forbids variable length array leadsuit make euchre error 1
student,are we required to submit any tests for the second half of the project like function tests for all the functions in gamecpp we wrote or a test of our whole project
student,do we need to test our own static functions for example in cardcpp in our cardtestscpp or is testing the functions that use them enough
student,after testing on the caen linux server i realized that i had an issue with my code i needed to pass a variable by reference i fixed it and everything is outputting perfectly when i test it in xcode but once i move back to linux its like i never fixed the problem is there any reason pass by reference for an int wouldnt work for linux
student,in the output for euchretest00out why does bob order up hearts its my understanding that the hands would be as follows alice nine spades ten spades jack spades king hearts ace hearts bob queen spades king spades nine clubs ten clubs jack clubs cathy ace spades nine hearts ten hearts queen clubs king clubs drew jack hearts queen hearts ace clubs nine diamonds ten diamonds jack of diamonds had turned up the only person with a diamonds card would be drew since the left bower for diamonds is jack of hearts so shouldnt drew have ordered up diamonds
student,im still a bit confused about the pack used after each hand if the upcard is at the top of the pack after dealing for each card played do i have to put that played card on to of the upcard and rebuild the pack up starting from that point or after a hand the pack is still the same as at the beginning of that hand and i can just reset my pointer to the first card and shuffle again without worrying about the order of the cards played
student,if im using diff in terminal for euchretest00 and euchretest01 and all of our output matches why is it not passing the autograder for those two test cases is something other than the output being tested please advise thank you
student,my output seems to be the same after using a diffchecker online so im guessing i might just be screwing up some whitespace after printing the winner ex alice and cathy win how many new lines should i print 0 1 2
student,do we have an unlimited amount per day
student,is there any opportunity to pick up exams prior to deorios next office hours on monday i would really like more than one day to look over my exam and possibly submit it for a regrade if at all possible
student,hey all so i just did the shapesh for the circle but i am really confused about the syntax in the shapescpp file ellipseellipsedouble xradin double yradin xradxradin yradyradin double ellipsearea const return pi xrad yrad etc i looked through all of deorios code from the corresponding lectures and i feel like they dont match up more so when i go to fill out circle in a similar fashion it just says and i m not sure what i am missing could someone point me to a particularly helpful tutorial or maybe just some slides that i over looked thank you
student,im confused about when a player willwont order up trump i understand the two face card part of it but does the dealer consider the actual rank of the card for example if bob is the dealer and the jack of spades is flipped up bobs hand jack of clubs face card trump queen clubs ace diamonds 9 spades 10 spades would bob pick up the jack of spades he does not currently have 2 spade face cards but would he consider that the upcard is a facecard itself the project spec does not touch on this exact scenario
student,alice queen of diamonds queen of hearts nine of diamonds jack of spades ace of hearts bob ace of diamonds ace of spades nine of clubs nine of spades nine of hearts cathy king of spades queen of clubs queen of spades jack of diamonds ten of hearts drew jack of clubs king of clubs jack of hearts ten of spades king of hearts alice deals ten of diamonds is turned up they should all pass in round 1 in round 2 who would order up and what suit would they order up thanks in advance for the clarification
student,this is a little late but i just want to give a massive thanks to vidal for staying overtime last night to help everyone on their projects your help is extremely appreciated and it definitely does not go unnoticed by us thanks vidal
student,i ran my code through both diff and sdiff and this is the output im getting why is it showing a difference in that line i know there are many people with diff check problems ive read through a lot of piazza posts and i havent found anything to answer this specific problem if anyone has any ideas or can direct me to a post i missed id appreciate it thank you
student,i know there have been several questions about this but im still having trouble with passing in argv4 through argv7 for the player names in gameinit ive tried creating a new array with just those elements and passing in the address of the first element but there were type conversion errors passing in the address of argv4 just gets the first name could someone please help me out
student,for round 2 the instructions say that a player will order up if he has one or more face cards of the suit which is the same color as the up card i was wondering is a card that would be a left bower of this suit jack of the same suit as the up card be considered as one of these face cards since the left bower takes the trump suit example during round 2 a player has the jack of spades in his hand and the up card is the 9 of spades would this card fulfill the requirement since as a left bower the jack of spades is considered a club the kind of card we are looking for in the second round thanks in advance
student,i know in round 1 of making trump the dealer picks up the upcard and discards their lowest card just wanted to double check that in round 2 if the next suit of the upcard is ordered up the dealer will not pick up the upcard right same goes for screw the dealer
student,i am trying to compare players against who won to tally up how many tricks each team has won however since the winners hand is different than the gameptrplayerx hand its not knowing they are the same player when i do statements like if winner player1 i dont want to use strcmp for fear of players having the same name how can i get around this issue
student,just wanted to be surethere is no special output for when screw the dealer occurs
student,i was wondering if there was any length restriction on the test case files mine are pretty long thank you
student,lets say you have a game that is being played with noshuffle at the end of the first hand youve dealt 20 cards for the 4 hands one upcard what should be the first card dealt for the next hand should it be the upcard one card after the upcard or the first card in the deck
student,lets say the upcard has a suit of clubs and making has reached second round if a player has a jack of clubs and no face cards of spades or clubs is it considered to be a suit of the same color and therefore spades are ordered up or is it still considered to be just a club and therefore the player would not order up
student,can somebody please explain the logic behind the ellipsedraw function and how it is determined what pixels need to be set to true and which remain false ie the inside of the for loop
student,will an exam key be posted at any time or is it just an office hours thing if we want rework some of the questions
student,if we didnt pick up our exams after lecture and we cant make it to oh is there another way to get them
student,in example01 hand0 alice orders up diamonds if a player can follow suit he plays the highest card that follows suit otherwise he plays the lowest card in his hand why does drew play a queen of hearts when he has a jack of hearts left bower in his hand similarly alice plays an ace of hearts when she has a jack of diamonds right bower in her hand
student,our output matches the test output exactly on diffchecker but our player and game functions still dont pass in the autograder does anyone have any idea on what may have gone wrong thanks
student,so my code was working not perfectly before running through at least 4 hands of play but now im getting errors and it cannot even finish the first hand this is making it pretty difficult to debug now i was wondering if there are any suggestions for a quick fix so i dont sped hours trying to figure it out these are the errors im getting warning unable to restore previously selected frame no memory available to program now unsafe to call malloc warning unable to restore previously selected frame
student,how is that possible if packin only has cards 9 and higher should it make sense that my upcard was 2 of spades if so why
student,we have a test with the following data trump diamonds led card ace of spades cards in hand ace of diamonds king of diamonds queen of diamonds 9 of clubs and ace of hearts the correct card returned is the ace of hearts but we keep getting the 9 of clubs shouldnt it be the 9 of clubs because the player cant follow suit doesnt have a trump and the 9 of clubs is their lowest card
student,how would i go about getting rid of the card played and playing the next card currently my code prints the same cards for each round in a hand and doesnt play any other card
student,my shuffle fcn works when it is called in the unit tests why is it not working when it is being called within game
student,this is probably a dumb question but in the spec it says that circle should not override any member functions does that include if all we do in the function is call the parent classes function
student,i am just a bit confused on what test cases we should be writing to catch the tricky bugs does this mean testing almost every card i dont understand what an edge case in this scenario would be other than the impossible cases of having identical cards
student,if anyone could shed any insight on this that would be extremely helpful and appreciated so our program passes our tests when we call it with noshuffle when we call it with shuffle the first hand is played correctly so if we make the points to win 1 our program works fine however when multiple hands our played we get a ton of seg faults after it shuffles the second time and we have absolutely no idea why we think it has something to do with our gameshuffle helper function which says if the gameptrshuffle is true to call our packshuffle otherwise it should reset the pack thanks
student,assume this person has js 9s 10s 9h 10h and the order up card is 9c and this is during round 2 will this person order up or pass i thought this person would order up because js would be recognized as clubs left bower during round 2 and because it is a face card this person would order up
student,i play cards passed by reference for the first trick but then when i play the second trick all the cards in each hand are set back as if they were never played but the hand number still remains correct4 what could be going wrong after debugging when looking at playcard the cards play exactly as they are supposed to and appear correct in each hand until i start resetting players for the new trick based on who won the previous trick if that makes sense any help would be appreciated
student,is there any way we can get the correct output for the test cases given in the spec
student,if a pack only has 24 cards and each player has 5 cards thats 20 cards cant you only play one hand per game and that is not enough if you needed 100 points to win the game so what do you do
student,code ran fine in xcode in terminal it gave the following regarding generalized initalizers if i cant use these how else can i write this function that is supposed to return a card with a suit that is variable
student,1 are we only required to write test cases for the functions that are wrote by ourselves 2 do we also have to test the functions provided by starter files 3 is one test case per function sufficient to get full credit for test cases style thanks
student,when we find the add the upcard to our hand and then find the lowest card within the hand including the upcard are we allowed to discard that upcard if its the lowest card
student,the spec says we need to submit header files while in the make finaltar the header files are not included i am not sure if we need to submit those files
student,in playeraddanddiscard after picking up the upcard we are supposed to find and discard the lowest card taking trump into consideration how are we supposed to find the suit of the upcard if we do not know the trump suit
student,hello so i noticed every time i call packdealone to deal a card to a player i get a segmentation fault and i do not know whyanyone else have this problem and could offer up some advice thanks
student,when i submit to the autograder it says my player function doesnt compile what does this mean for my code on my own computer it compiles and runs perfectly
student,seems like a stupid question but just want to make sure is the upcard the card on top of the deck after shuffling and dealing
student,weve been compiling our code in terminal on my macbook and were getting some segfaults when we play the game with shuffling so we want to compile on caen and use valgrind havent done this before so if anyone knows how to get started any advice would be greatly appreciated thanks
student,our elaborate test case files are on my computer but my partner is doing the submission do i need to bother sending those test files to him for the autograder ie will this affect our grade
student,hope everyones day is going well i just had a quick question is it alright if our function gameplay is a little over the 50 line suggestion like say by about 200 lines or will we get marked off for that im asking because at this point splitting it into multiple functions will create more opportunity for error in the future i know to split it up but since i already have it written will i get docked if i leave it thanks
student,im compiling my project 3 files and i am getting the following error messages from the g compiler on caen linux what does this multiple definition of main mean i didnt include any cpp files the only thing i can think of is that i have main functions in multiple files but i dont see why this should be a problem

student,it says in the speck that in making trump a player considers the up card the player who dealt and whether it is the first or second round if the player deciding on whether to order up is the dealer and he has just one trump face card would he order up technically he would now take the up card and add it to his hand assuming its round 1 and have a hand that has 2 trump face cards if the up card was a face card
student,yo do we need to worry if someones name is symbols or weird ie or gmoney or 1234 thanks
student,or do you have to use playerinit is something like player p0 gameptrplayers0 or player p0 gameptrplayers0 legal trying to figure out why i have a segmentation fault
student,should the screw the dealer case be written in our playermaketrump function or can we include it in the gamecpp file
student,do we need to print point if a team has 1 point or can we always just print points
student,if we are given bad information in the argv elements should the code printing argv execute before the error message and then exit or should only the exit message be printed thanks

student,my project compiles when i scp my finalsubmittargz into the caen computer ssh tar xzvf and make test to create my project but my project does not compile in the autograder specifically my playertests and euchre output tests fail i do not have physical access to a caen computer for now i compile with the o1 flags since i am reasonably confident in my solution what other things can i try to check
student,i keep getting this error which points me to a helper function i have declared in my code as static int maketrump the function is supposed to return nonvoid so why wont my code compile
student,the line of code we are using is initializing a pointer to a card to a nullptr card card nullptr is this allowed or will it fail the autograder
student,how come this wont work cardprintgameptrpacknext next is a pointer so its not that
student,hi i was wondering if it was possible to utilize argv and argc in xcode i couldnt figure out a way to input to the shell using xcode so i had to come up with a workaround to run euchre but i would like to make sure my program works with argv and argc as well if this is possible how would i go about doing it
student,this function call to packdealone doesnt work packdealonegameptrpack however when calling the function with an initialized pack by itself it works packdealonepack is this something wrong with my call to packdealone and the game to pack struct
student,when outputting the score after each hand what happens if a team has 1 point do we say alice and cathy have 1 point or can we keep it as alice and cathy have 1 points
student,hi so were adding in the rmes to our functions and id just like to clarify on a couple of points 1 does the rme belong in the cpp and the h files or only the h files 2 should static helper functions be declared in the h file if we added static helper functions should we modify the h file or is that not to be modified under any circumstances 3 when writing static helper functions is it acceptable for them to all be at the top of the program or should they be defined near the function they support i appreciate the help
student,in my code i tried to use the operator to keep my variables between 03 but for some reason if i do arrayx4 and x4 it seg faults additionally i tried storing this value as a int temp x4 arraytemp and that also seg faults i couted the value of temp and it is less than 4 always so i am quite confused
student,when i try to run the playertests file using playertests i get a blank line anyone know why this is or what is causing the problem it started after i wrote playerleadcard thanks
student,i didnt see this specified anywhere and was wondering how many times can we submit to the autograder
student,i know it wasnt as important for the checkpoint but are the test files going to be checked for style ie spaces organization of tests appropriateness of player names presence of expletives in assert statements etc etc thank you
student,can i assume that if assertcardcomparethreediamonds twodiamonds 0 works as intended then the same will work for assertcardcomparetwodiamonds threediamonds 0 basically is it acceptable to assume the function will work the other way around or is it better to test it
student,when making trump do we only print that a player passes if they do so in the first round or would we want to print something along the lines of bob passes cathy passes drew passes alice passes bob passes cathy passes drew passes alice passes alice orders up clubs if none of the players ordered up in rounds 1 or 2 and therefore screw the dealer was invoked
student,can we assume that no 2 players will have the same name can we assert that none of them have the same name
student,after messing with gdb on linux and throwing cout statements everywhere i think my seg fault is happening on the first line ie int mainint argc char argv is there any reason why that might happen
student,im 100 sure i did not define gameinit and gameplay again for a second time not sure why g gives me this error
student,so before i called on gameinit i had the line game gameptr after this line i have code to take out the arguments from argv and put them into variables when i run this on g it gives me an error saying gameptr may be uninitialized isnt the only way to have a gameptr for the first parameter in gameinit is to have an uninitialized game variable in the code i mean obviously we initialize it in gameinit so doesnt that first parameter in gameinit have to be unintialized
student,where do we put the rmes for the game functions just above the function in gamecpp for comments on the tests files card player etc do we have to go through each test case and write a comment on exactly what it tests or can we group them all together like lets say 10 test cases that all test playerplaycard and just write a comment that says tests playerplaycard
student,so up until now i thought our test cases including project 2s were used for a version of the code intentionally made buggy by the staff and we are to catch as many bugs as we can for points and that this was going to be for project 3 as well have i been misunderstanding and the test cases are just for our own benefit in making sure our code doesnt have bugs so hypothetically if my code and style were perfect i could meet the minimum requirements such as 1 additional test case per function and i would get a perfect score for the project thanks in advance
student,is there another way to print a cstring other than writing a loop that prints each character referring to when we have to print names of players throughout the gameplay
student,when the autograder runs tests on our code are any of these tests designed to break the rm clauses
student,question i noticed that the game went from drew alice alice alice bob in terms of who got the tricks i understand the specs say the team that did not make trump gets 2 points for having 3 or 4 tricks alices team alice had 3 tricks and for the output the game was playing up to 1 point so how come the game did not end after alices third trick
student,when i run euchrecpp it builds successfully but all that prints to the output screen is error opening pathapplicationsxcodeappcontentsdeveloperusrbinusrbinbinusrsbinsbin program ended with exit code 1 can anyone explain what this error means
student,sorry if this has been answered before piazza wont let me search any questions for some reason and just brings me to the most recent so i havent been able to find this question before but in round 1 of make trump we have to add the upcard to the dealers hand and then remove the smallest card from his hand i wrote code to find the minimum card and then the location where that minimum card occurs now im trying to set that spot in the hands array where the smallest card is located to the upcard in this way removing the smallest card and replacing it with the upcard im getting an error thats telling me no viable overloaded i was just wondering if theres a different way to go about this or if im missing something why isnt it letting me set that place to the upcard changing his hand thanks
student,if the program outputs a certain number of lines of code does the output window start cutting it off on the top
student,hey guys were trying to initialize the deck of cards with euchrecpp but for some reason even though our packinit function has previously worked just fine and theres a packin file exactly where it should be relative to the project files that were using and the filename is being read in from argv correctly it just isnt opening the file no matter what we try is this just a quirk of visual basic and will it work fine with linux has anyone else had this problem help would be hugely appreciated
student,if we call cardcompare with the two cards as ace of diamonds and ace of hearts while the trump suit is spades would they be considered equally worthless or would the ace of diamonds be better than the ace of hearts because diamonds is ordered higher than hearts would the same apply if we added the led card as say the nine of clubs thanks
student,cardtests cardtestsout packtests packtestsout playertests playertestsout euchre packin noshuffle 1 alice bob cathy drew euchretest00out make test error 139 what does error 139 mean im attempting to call printcard in my playerleadcard function for testing purposes
student,we are getting a bad access code whenever we call cardprint when stepping through it we see the card ptr is correct but it will not cout anything it says thread 1 excbadaccess code1 address to clarify we are not outputting cardprint we are just calling the function ie cardprintledcard ledcard being of type card any help would be greatly appreciated
student,why is it telling me i have no terminating character when i obviously have one prompt is not copy and pasted
student,is there a way to enter command line arguments in xcode
student,in round two of making trump if i understand correctly no matter what the suit of the same color as the up card but thats not the same suit as the upcard will always become trump because if none of the players make it trump then the dealer always will
student,i was stepping through my playermaketrump and realized that when i change orderupsuit to desired suit it changes the suit of the upcard for example if the upcard is jack of diamonds and bob wishes to order up in the second round since he has a card of hearts in his hand my playermaketrump changes the upcardsuit to hearts when i assign the next suit to orderupsuit it changed upcardsuit from diamonds to hearts is this supposed to happen if so why the specs told us to modify orderupsuit but i didnt realize it would actually change the suit of the upcardim not sure if it is supposed to change the suit of the upcard
student,for example the game is up to 10 points and we start at 00 after one team scores a point and it becomes 10 do we run gameplay again or do we only run gameplay once and it will continue running until a team hits 10 points thanks
student,hello my partner and i thoughts that we had passed test01 however when we compile it it says that the euchretest01out differs from euchretest01outcorrect we have checked the output line by line and have found no differences between our output and the correct output and have also used an online difference checker which also tells us there is no difference between our file and the correct file we are confused as to what we should be doing now in order to fix this issue please help
student,how many points does a team receive when they win 32 41 march or the other team euchres them
student,say i have a player who currently has these cards in hand 9 of hearts 10 of diamonds jack of spades king of diamonds if the led card was a 10 of clubs and the trump suit is clubs what card in his hand should be played thanks in advance
student,hypothetically lets say this is the situation trump is spades alice leads ten of hearts bob plays ten of diamonds cathy plays nine of diamonds drew plays nine of hearts who would take the trick in this situation we were confused when we were looking at our code thinking of possible test cases

student,im using gdb for the first timehow do i know what my arguments are i know its supposed to show you what your variables are for example when i am stepping into a function it shows me what im passing in but if im in a for loop within the function it wont show me what x other variables are how do i see what the values of the variables in each line are
student,having trouble with cout in euchrecpp things only print correctly if they enter an error statement otherwise nothing prints ie the arguments i tried cout ing a random phrase at the beginning of my main function before it checks for errors and that doesnt print either any idea why this would be happening
student,ive been working on my project and everything so far has been fine but today i tried to compile my entire project using make test and i kept getting cardtests cardtestsout packtests packtestsout make test error 1 so i looked at the make test code and then at my project 3 file and it turns out im missing playertestsout and i cant find it anywhere any ideas
student,we are making a pointer to a player called dealer that keeps track of who the current dealer is we were trying to use for loops to iterate who the action is on however since we writing code with respect to dealer for example dealer1 to refer to person left of dealer or dealer 3 to refer to person right of dealer we go out of the array when anyone other than player 0 is the dealer so are we supposed to write 4 different scenarios for each player being the dealer it seems quite repetitive for example if player 0 is dealer deal this way make trump this way etc if player 1 is dealer etc thanks
student,is there someone in particular i should go to if i had a problem to discuss about my partner situation thanks
student,size of argc would be 8 right
student,when i try to call gameinit in euchrecpp i get a compile error for the const char const playernames argument i made a cont char const playernamesnumplayers i included gameh by initializing it to argv4argv7 and i get an invalid conversion from char to int error whenever i try to compile what could the problem be
student,when compiling in g i get the error taking address of temporary i get this error for every line that i use packdealonegameptrpack in a function call playeraddcardgameptrplayers packdealonegameptrpack compiles fine in visual messed around with the syntax to see if i could pass the argument in a different way wo compile errors in visual no luck so far any thoughts
student,is the second dealer bob in the example they give in the specs
student,can we submit the extra couts that we put in both gamecpp and euchrecpp that helps us with testing the code
student,im compiling my proj on a caen computer for the first time so i can use gdb but its giving me this error bash41 make euchre make no rule to make target gamecpp needed by euchre stop i made sure all 4 h files were included in euchrecpp and gamecpp and my makefiles arent modified or anything so im not sure what else i can do
student,i was unable to attend prof deorios office hours today to pick up my exam and i have a prior commitment that will cause me to miss most if not all of wednesdays lecture is there an alternative time i could pick my exam up or could i have one of my friends in the lecture get it for me
student,does player 0 always start as the dealer in each game or can it be different
student,undefined reference to gameinitgame char const bool int char const const what exactly does this mean
student,could someone clarify exactly what things should be happeningbe initialized in gameinit confused from other posts about whether or not to shuffle and what other things should be happening within it compared to what should be happening within gameplay thanks
student,i cant figure out what to put in the first argument for gameinit in euchrecpp i keep getting the error that i cannot initalize a varibale of type game with an lvalue of type char any hints on how would i go about converting this thanks
student,hey guys having some trouble getting my euchrecpp function to compile i cant seem to find the right type to pass in to the gameinit function for the 5th argument i have tried a lot of different options but keep getting error cannot convert ‘char’ to ‘const char const’ for argument ‘5’ to ‘void gameinitgame const char bool int const char const any help properly declaring playernames or passing it into gameinit would be greatly appreciated thanks
student,note i know that theyre changing the autograder tonight but if youre trying to use the current autograder if your diffing is coming out clean but youre not getting the last two tests in the autograder try looking at where all your couting is happening if its happening anywhere besides in gamecpp that could be your issue
student,hey there when i run make tests on caen i have no problems i submit to the autograder and it runs for multiple minutes what could potentially be the reason for this i have no infinite loops thanks
student,can anyone explain the difference btw exitexitfailure and exit1 in project3 when opening of packin fails which one should we use or they are the same in this case thanks a lot
student,so far my output looks like this euchre packin noshuffle 1 alice bob cathy drew hand 0 alice deals jack of diamonds turned up bob passes cathy passes drew2x2 matrix with 0030 passes alice passes and so on i dont know why there is a random matrix printing right after drew i tried other names and they all work unless the name has 4 letters in it i tried changing the other names and they all still worked any ideas
student,the h file says see the project specs for strategy and the only time i see anyone ever drawing and discarding a card is if on the first round the dealer decides he wants the up card to be trump ive played euchre where there were other instances where you would draw new cards but i dont see that anywhere in the specs so am i right in assuming the only time someone would add and discard a card is the dealer exchanging the up card in round one if trump is ordered up in round 1
student,do we need to check the content of packin in euchrecpp that is check if all the 24 cards are in the correct range or no two cards are repeated
student,my problem is with this paragraph in the strategy guidelines i dont understand the last line here is my understanding of what it says if the trump suit is ordered up during round one then the dealer receives the up card dealer now has 6 cards and then discards his lowest card now has 5 cards and the turnup now 4 cards am i confusing terminology here why would the dealer take the up card and then discard it or is this an error in the instructions or is there something im missing is the turnup not the first card put on the table after the dealing is done
student,can we safely assume that any input pack file will contain all 24 euchre cards with no doubles and no cards not in 9 ace
student,does the autograder use our euchre and game and then not our player pack card etc like what of ours does it use and what of notours does it use thanks
student,are we allowed to add additional variables to the struct in gameh i cant think of any other way to keep track of which player is the dealer except to make a pointer variable to keep track of this thanks
student,during the first round of making trump should the dealer evaluate the upcard as part of hisher hand when deciding to pick up or turn down the spec only explicitly mentions cards in hand but id hate for my players to turn down a bauer and lose for an hour
student,hello im having the same problem a lot of students are currently having that my diff comes out with no output for both euchretest01 and euchretest00 but i dont get any credit for either test on the autograder i have read through the other piazza posts on this and have tried several different things including redownloading the h files redownloading the euchretest00outcorrect and euchretest01outcorrect running the program with valgrind both tests comes out clean note i am using make euchre to compile any ideas on whats happening thanks
student,we are also having the issue where everything works perfectly in terminal but keeps failing the autograder we tried using valgrind as another piazza post suggested and got this output we are not sure if this means there is an error or if all is okay
student,i figured out how to add arguments when the program is ran but since it isnt being ran with the program as an exec my first element in argv that prints in my xcode output is the location of the file output usersetceecs280project3 packin noshuffle 1 alice bob cathy drew is this fine to continue with for now as long as im able to access the arguments thats all that matters right when i run it as an exec in terminal it prints the correct euchre argument i plan on running everything in caen soon but like the debugging tools of xcode much more so would prefer this approach
student,for hand 1 of test 01 do these hands look correct for some reason ace of diamonds turns up instead of jack of clubs so i was wondering if i shuffled correctly alice jack of hearts queen of hearts nine of diamonds ten of diamonds jack of diamonds bob king of hearts ace of hearts nine of clubs queen of diamonds king of diamonds cathy queen of spades king of spades ten of clubs jack of clubs queen of clubs drew ace of spades nine of hearts ten of hearts king of clubs ace of clubs
student,should my code be reading in a pack named packin or a pack named packintxt i noticed that the google drive calls it packin but when i download the file it automatically changes to packintxt i am running ubuntu on a pc thanks in advance
student,to clarify on the strategy when playing a card if you have a nine of hearts and a queen of clubs but the trump is hearts and the lead suit is spades would you still play the queen of clubs because this is technically the lowest card in your hand so the only way a player plays trump is if they dont have the lead card and they only have the trump suit in their hand
student,when dealing were trying to use the functions given playeraddcard and packdealone but were getting errors that we cannot convert nonconst to const what is the best way to approach this problem
student,suppose i ran the euchre program like this euchre packin shuffle 10 andrew deorio kevin fu jeff ringenberg euchre match of the century note argc 8 and all arguments are valid the backslash makes the space part of the argument so argv6 jeff ringenberg the fourth players name is the empty string and the and everything after it is a comment and doesnt get passed to the program what should the first line of output be the comment isnt technically one of the arguments to the program so it probably makes sense that that shouldnt get printed but the shell also gobbles up the quotes and backslashes so its basically impossible to determine whether each argument was surrounded by double quotes single quotes or neither so should we just print euchre packin shuffle 10 andrew deorio kevin fu jeff ringenberg there are two spaces at the end there or should we do some rudimentary checking to see if quotesbackslashes would have been needed for each argument and print something different
student,do we always print the score with partnership0 first and then partnership1 or the partnership that won followed by the losing partnership ex alice and cathy have 2 points bob and drew have 0 points in this case alice and cathy are both partnership0 and the partnership that won
student,i just want to make sure should we shuffle the deck before dealing the first hand to each player this is at the very start of the game
student,this is a very specific question but i ran into an issue while debugging and im not sure whats going on for the second example output given to us as the last card played by the dealer alice she is supposedly supposed to play an ace of hearts with spades being led and diamonds being trump im trying to figure out why alice plays the ace of hearts when she has no cards of the led suit spades and possesses a nine of clubs in her hand which is a lower overall card value than the ace of hearts the issue here could be either 1 i shuffled wrong and the ace of hearts really is the lowest card value in alices starting hand 2 im misunderstanding why the ace of hearts is played over the nine of clubs or very unlikely 3 theres something wrong with the example output can anyone help me out
student,is there a way to check in packtests if exitexitfailure was called by calling an incorrect file in packcpp
student,i understand what this warning means but i cant seem to find a solution for it just to make sure it wasnt the code that i wrote in my euchrecpp i actually put this code in my main in euchrecpp int mainint argc char argv int sum 0 for int i 0 i argc i sum atoiargvi cout sum is sum endl return 0 everywhere else the above code woks however when i compile it using the command from the specs it fails g ­pedantic ­wall ­werror ­o1 euchrecpp gamecpp playercpp packcpp cardcpp ­o euchre i went into the packin make sure there was a newline and it still gives me that warning any ideas
student,why does alice play the queen of diamonds in the second trick of the first hand if in her hand she also has the nine of clubs jack of diamonds and king of diamonds arent you supposed to play the lowest card in your hand if trump is diamonds wouldnt the nine of clubs be the lowest card
student,should we shuffle the hand in gameinit if shuffle is true or only in gameplay for personal testing it doesnt matter but it might be different in the larger test cases
student,just wanted to know what the hypothetical result would be if if your players are alice bob cathy drew in that order 1 bob deals cathy orders up in round 1 like in what order would you print what 2 bob deals cathy orders up in round 2 my general confusion is understanding how the order of who orderspasses should be printed if someone could just clarify that itd be super helpful
student,theyre until 5 pm but cant find the location on the google cal thanks
student,i am struggling to get xcode to read in a file does anybody know how i can get xcode to recognize a file it is showing up on the left side below project 4 but will not read in
student,at the end of each hand are we resetting the pack shuffling or just resetting the pack and shuffling based on input shuffle noshuffle
student,in gameplay we are required to print out ranks and suits sometimes however if you print them as it is they come out as integers i want to convert the enum back to a string but i dont how to access suitnames or ranknames array from a card in gameplay for ex card upcard upcardsuitnames isnt working any other suggestions
student,if i for example get an exception with my points input euchre packin shuffle 1000 alice bob cathy drew my output txt file should contain euchre packin shuffle 1000 alice bob cathy drew usage euchre packfilename shufflenoshuffle pointstowin name1 name2 name3 name4 or just usage euchre packfilename shufflenoshuffle pointstowin name1 name2 name3 name4
student,for project 2 i lost style points because i didnt include rmes in the p2cpp file for functions we were required to write eg sum product etc i thought it would be redundant since they were already in the header file i submitted a regrade request but i have yet to hear back i just wanted to make sure before turning in project 3 should i copy the rmes from the header files into the cpp files
student,how do i step through my program with gdb i am able to do it with playertestspacktests etc but i dont know what commands to use for gamecpp
student,is it bad style to not include brackets on if statements that only have one line of code or is it bad style to include brackets if they are not needed
student,hi currently on the eecs280 calendar it says there is office hours rob today from 2 5pm but does not give a location where would this be
student,should we be using strncmp or cstr in our euchrecpp to check for errors in the shuffle argument or do i need to dereference the pointer and loop through each letter in the word i feel like there is probably an easier way that that
student,should i assert that card compare does not equal 0 in my gameplay or is that incorrect
student,i keep trying to compile my code but i am getting this error bash41 g wall werror o1 pedantic euchrecpp o game tmpcc6bjbvro in function main euchrecpptext0x13b undefined reference to gameinitgame char const bool int char const const collect2 ld returned 1 exit status i am not sure what this means and i am passing in the right types and included the correct files any help or suggestions
student,im sorry if this has already been asked are we being graded on the unit tests regression tests that we write for game or euchre as in should we write them and then comment them out when we submit them to the autograder so that the graders can see the unit tests we wrote whilst coding gameeuchre but it wont screw up the autograder command line stuff or are we not being graded on the test cases we make for gameeuchre but solely on whether we pass the test cases that the autograder has for us if we pass the autograder 1414 then do we need to still worry about writing a huge set of test cases for euchre and game
student,i want to compare two cards card a is the nine of clubs and card b is the ace of hearts if im calling the cardcompare function that was given to us int cardcompareconst card a const card b return asuit aranksuitsize bsuit branksuitsize then the return expression is equal to 2 74 1 124 19 which is to say that the nine of clubs is less than the ace of hearts im confused as to why this is the case when in this basic comparison any clubs is be greater than any hearts could someone please explain i feel like im just missing something thank you
student,im keeping track of the team who makes trump in my maketrumphelper function which returns the trump suit for example if maketrump in player evaluates to true i assign that players index 2 to teammakestrump not sure how to go about getting that information in my gameplay function though i could declare it as a global variable in the gamecpp file i dont think thats allowed for this project though
student,do we need to turn in test cases for euchrecpp the make final doesnt seem to include a file that would include various packs and command line arguments wed use for testing but the spec states we have provided several example tests and you will need to add more which i am interpreting at the moment as you will need to turn in more test cases and also if we need to turn in test cases how would we turn those in as comments in euchrecpp or something like that
student,if screw the dealer is invoked does that mean hisher team is the one who made trump
student,in the implementation of gamecpp when we have to record the scores for each team we have to compare the number of tricks they won with 3 4 5 are they counted as magic numbers
student,i checked my code and found that i did use maxstrlen in the whole project is there some potential place in the project that we have to create a temporary string
student,so on specification it says playing when playing a card players use a simple strategy that considers only the suit that was led a more complex strategy would also consider the cards on the table but again we will keep it simple if a player can follow suit he plays the highest card that follows suit otherwise he plays the lowest card in his hand when it says highest card that follows suit does it mean highest card that follows suit of led card or card that was played by previous player
student,added in a new test case for my playerleadfunction there are no compiler issues but the project wont run after i type playertests i just get a blank line what does that mean
student,so drew has ace of spades nine of hearts ten of hearts queen of clubs and king of clubs in the correct output jack of spades led by bob king of spades played by cathy ace of spades played by drew nine of diamonds played by alice drew takes the trick king of clubs led by drew ace of clubs played by alice nine of spades played by bob jack of clubs played by cathy alice takes the trick ten of diamonds led by alice ten of spades played by bob nine of clubs played by cathy queen of clubs played by drew alice takes the trick jack of hearts led by alice ace of hearts played by bob ten of clubs played by cathy ten of hearts played by drew alice takes the trick why is drew playing ten of hearts instead of nine of hearts shoudnt he play the lowest card
student,if a team both euchred and marched the other team ie the other team called trump but the team won all five tricks anyway how should we output the results euchred marched or marched euchred or should we not worry about that happening thanks
student,is there a way to enter command line arguments in xcode
student,does the trump suit always have to be the suit of the upcard or the next suit it can only be one of those 2 suits right
student,in the tests it says to throw away the upcard if it is the lowest card among your hand and the upcard what exactly does it mean to throw it away do i just move the next pointer over one
student,hi we are getting a seg fault when we run our program in caen and after running the code through valgrind we got this it looks like it says theres an issue with strcpy in playerinit but my partner and i are having trouble figuring out how thats possible our code runs fine when put in xcode or visual studio and passes the public tests any ideas thanks
student,hello i was wondering something about argv is argv0 the name of the executable or the address of the first chararcter also does the compiler automatically handle the deferencing when you cout it
student,ive read all the previous posts regarding this problem but i still cant get mine to work when i submit the tar to the autograder my euchre test files receive 0 out of 4 points it compiles but when i run the diff check on terminal everything is identical is there something else that i need to do ive included all the libraries that the other posts regarding this issue have mentioned
student,will we fail the autograder if we have our own pack text files
student,ive been trying to search around and it seems this has happened to a few other people i got all my tests working checked the output with diff as it does in the make file already have exactly the same output compiled both on caen g v 44711 and ubuntu g v 482 and still am failing the euchretest00 and euchretest01 ive read through 1586 1592 1591 1517 1579 1574 1529 1525 for anyone else with the issue in case i accidentally edited something in one of the h files i redownloaded all of them then submitted again still with the same issue so now im here as well im guessing its probably an issue with what ive included at the top of my files however i am not getting compiler errors from the autograder just 04 for both of the euchre tests that output looks like this test case results cardtest00 11 cardtests 11 packtest00 11 packtests 11 playertest00 11 playertests 11 euchretest00 04 euchretest01 04 total score 614 it is my understanding from a few of the aforementioned posts that if an illegal library is included that will not pass the autograder or if you dont include everything you need that too shall not pass if anyone has any hints or suggestions for the next direction i should go in they are welcome in my euchrecpp file i have include gameh include cassert include cstring include cstdlib include iostream in gamecpp i have include gameh include cardh include packh include playerh include cassert include cstring include cstdlib include iostream in playercpp i have include cardh include playerh include cassert include cstring include cstdlib include iostream in cardcpp i have include cardh include cassert include cstring include cstdlib include iostream and finally in packcpp i have include packh include cassert include cstring include cstdlib include iostream include fstream as well as using namespace std below every block of includes on each file if anyone combs over those and notices something out of place let me know i have a feeling its a small yet obvious issue ive overlooked somewhere if i cant figure it out by days end ill probably hit office hours tomorrow thanks everyone
student,its in round 2 of making and i am not the dealer i have a jack of diamonds in hand the other four cards are either spades or clubs and the turned up card is queen of diamonds should i order up hearts since jack of diamond is considered as a face heart if i ordered up hearts
student,i was looking back at this and i realized that the function didnt make use of const card upcard parameter at all given its a parameter given and im not using it i probably have done something wrong what is the importance of this paramater if the suit of the upcard is originally being passed through the suit orderupsuit anyways
student,when i run make test i get the message make playertests error 1 does anyone know what this means
student,does euchre packin shuffle 10 alice bob cathy drew counted as a line of output
student,for one of my helper functions two of the arguments are const player players player dealer however when i try to set dealer equal to the address of one of the player objects in players i get a compile error this is what i am trying to do dealer players0 and the error says assigning to player from incompatible type const player my guess is that the compiler doesnt want to assign another pointer to a const player object in the players array because then i could theoretically change the contents of the array with this new pointer my question is this what is happening if so how do i get around it where i can still const pass arrays by reference and still set pointers equal to the adresses of their objects in this example i just want to keep track of who is the dealer
student,i cant figure out how to pass arguments into gdb without it exiting the program for example i type into the terminal as follows bash41 g pedantic wall werror g euchrecpp gamecpp playercpp packcpp cardcpp o euchre bash41 gdb euchre gdb run euchre packin shuffle 10 alice bob cathy drew it then proceeds to print this starting program afsumicheduuserproject3euchre euchre packin shuffle 10 alice bob cathy drew usage euchre packfilename shufflenoshuffle pointstowin name1 name2 name3 name4 euchre cardcpp104 t string2enumconst char const char const int with t rank assertion 0 failed program received signal sigabrt aborted 0x000000327fe32625 in raise from lib64libcso6 i am really lost and some guidance would help a lot thank you
student,my code compiles in the terminal by typing make euchre but after i type in ecuhre packin shuffle 10 alice bob cathy drew it always returned segmentation fault i passed the published test case and got the same output what goes wrong here
student,how do i store the player names from argv4 argv5 argv6 and argv7 if im trying to store them in an array of c strings or is there a better way to store them from argv that still lets me use them in gameinit thank you in advance for your help
student,our program works perfectly on my partners computer mac xcode but it does not work on my computer mac sublime code runs but it produces completely different outputs any solution
student,when i run make test on my computer and in the caen environment everything passes without an issue however when i do make finaltar and then submit i keep getting 04 on the final two tests i went back and made sure that all the files listed in the spec along with the grouptxt were in the submission anyone else running into the same issueany tips on what to do to fix it thanks
student,so i finally got my outputs for the two public test cases to match euchretest00outcorrect and euchretest01outcorrect exacty but i am still failing the autograder does the auto grader test for more than just the visible output to the terminal
student,the spec says the following the winner of the trick or round leads the next the first card called the lead is played by the eldest hand regardless of who is the maker eldest hand player at left of the dealer say dealer is 0 eh is 1 the winner of the trick is player at index 3 this means he would play the first card during the next hand doesnt this violate the above statements during the next hand dealer would be 1 eh should be 2 because he is left of the dealer players should be 3 and 0 according to the first statement though the player who leads would now be at index 3 very confused help
student,from 1507 hand each of the 4 players plays all 5 cards that they were dealt there are 5 tricks in each hand how are there 5 tricks in each hand i get that a hand consists of dealing cardsmaking trumpleadingplayingcomparing cards so shouldnt there only be one trick per hand and whoever has the highest card wins the trick for that round and the spec says the team that made trump gets 2 points for winning all 5 tricks and 1 point for winning 3 or 4 the other team gets 2 points for winning 34 or 5 tricks so you modify the number of points for each team based on how many tricks they win in each hand is what im understanding i dont get how there are 5 tricks per hand though think im missing some big info on how this game works
student,if the led card is jack of diamond and the trump is heart will the next player follow heart suit or diamond
student,im having a hard time figuring out how i can prevent the player from playing a card he already played i tried making a new array without the played card and setting the players hand equal to that array but since the size of the array would need to change every time a player plays a card it doesnt work can someone help me out on figuring out how i can mark an already played card inside the players hand arrays
student,ive checked all piazza posts thoroughly and double checked all my includes make test works diff checked my output but it still wont compile on the autograder has anyone had any luck in fixing their own euchretest00 etc compile errors maybe someone elses fix will work for me
student,this might not be enough information to receive help over piazza but my code was running into a segfault so i started stepping through it using gdb i realized my gameptrpacknext pointer was changing the location it points to outside of valid memory right after i try and cout something like hand 0 for example is there any reason why using cout should ever change the value of a pointer
student,is it possible for players on opposite teams to have the same name i ask because a small portion of my code compares player names to see what team theyre on if theyre on the same team
student,when i attempt to initialize gameptr in gamecpp i run into an issue when i try to initialize the pack in my packinit i call cardinit but because the pack hasnt been initialized the card pointer i pass the function packptrcardsi does not point to anything any advice on how to tackle this issue would be great
student,in project specification we are told if the trump suits is ordered up during round one the dealer receives it and discards the lowest card among his hand and the turnup here lowest means taking trump into consideration right for example if the trump is hearts and the dealer has following 6 cards after adding the turnup 9 of hearts 10 of spades k of spades k of hearts k of clubs k of diamonds then he should discard 10 of spades not 9 of hearts right
student,is our program supposed to reprint the command line input from the user ex euchre noshuffle 1 alice bob cathy drew mine currently doesnt but the command line inputs are printed in the correct output files we received so when i use the diff command that line is coming up as an error could this also be why my code is failing to compile for euchretests00 and euchretests01 on the autograder
student,so when i try to compile my program using g etc for euchre everything compiles fine but when i try to do the command line euchre etc etc at first it was printing the error message so i adjusted my code to figure out which error it was hitting but now all it says when i try to use the command line is bash euchre no such file or directory and then when i try to do the longer line that compiles and diffs the output g pedantic wall werror o1 euchrecpp gamecpp playercpp packcpp cardcpp o euchre euchre packin noshuffle 1 alice bob cathy drew euchretest00out diff euchretest00outcorrect euchretest00out i get clang error no such file or directory euchre clang error no such file or directory packin clang error no such file or directory noshuffle clang error no such file or directory 1 clang error no such file or directory alice clang error no such file or directory bob clang error no such file or directory cathy clang error no such file or directory drew clang error no such file or directory diff clang error no such file or directory euchretest00outcorrect what is going wrong here
student,for addanddiscard is it mandatory for the dealer to keep the upcard in their hand for example imagine the dealer had a hand of the 10 jack queen king and ace of spades and the nine of spades was the upcard if bob called trump during the first round of making alice would have to pick it up however it would rate as the worst card in her hand if she did in this instance is it permissible for alice to discard the upcard and leave her hand as dealt or is she required to keep the upcard in her hand and discard the 10 of spades in this case thanks
student,for euchre test 01 after shuffling each player has player 0s cards ace of hearts nine of clubs jack of diamonds queen of diamonds king of diamonds player 1s cards queen of spades king of spades ace of spades ten of clubs jack of clubs player 2s cards nine of hearts ten of hearts queen of clubs king of clubs ace of clubs player 3s cards jack of hearts queen of hearts king of hearts nine of diamonds ten of diamonds is this correct
student,sorry this might seem like a silly question but we just wanna make sure theres a space right after shufflenoshuffle right thanks
student,i just tried submitting my code to the autograder and i received the following message test case euchretest00 failed to compile euchretest00 04 test case euchretest01 failed to compile euchretest01 04 is this saying that my code is failing to compile altogether or was i supposed to submit additional files to the autograder im not sure why it would be the first because my code compiles on the vnc terminal ive been using thanks
student,are cards in the players hands also ordered by the same rule stated in the spec highest card in the first element and the lowest in the last
student,did the player adddiscard have to take into account the trump suit of the upcard or just pure ordering
student,though i passed all the tests of checkpoint its possible to fail some tests for those six tested files is this correct thanks
student,im doing a sanity check and trying to print out the four players alice bob and drew print out fine but cathy prints to nothing does anybody have any idea what may be going wrong
student,for card player and pack i added lots of tests for card and player although not seeing how much more i could add for pack are we being graded on the amount of tests we add for these programs and are the test files being graded on style or whatever
student,for the first test case it says that the first play should be jack of spades led by bob king of spades played by cathy ace of spades played by drew nine of diamonds played by alice drew takes the trick but why would alice play the 9 diamonds and not the ace of clubs according to the specs isnt diamonds higher than clubs
student,does it make sense that points to win is set to be 0 in the test case
student,i decided to try xcode for the first time for this project but i cant click the build button in the upper left for some reason it wont work do i need to install any kind of plugin or anything
student,we have looked at previous piazza posts and tried debugging but we are still getting errors for suitnext it is not consistently aborting or passsing when we call suitnext many times it will work but then if we add a simple coutendl or call a helper function that uses it in our while loop it then it aborts also we use suitprint and it prints out the correct suit does anyone have any suggestions on what to do thanks in advance
student,up to the first checkpoint my code passes all the tests and runs fine on both the caen system and my partners computer using visual studio when i try to run the code on my computer using xcode however it says the build failed what function do i set as my maincpp in order for the code to run correctly i have looked at the handout posted on ctools about xcode and other work environments but i cant figure it out thanks
student,i was trying to come up with a scenario where the dealer is actually screwed but i couldnt find one based on the given strategies the only scenarios i could come up with where ones where the dealer would choose to order up the suit on the second round of making anyway can anyone provide a scenario where the dealer is screwed
student,does dealer only have an effect on the second round of making
student,hi all i am really confused as to the correct out put file for test01 in hand 0 of test 01 the third and fourth tricks are really throwing me for a loop the correct output is trump is diamonds in this hand jack of diamonds led by alice ten of clubs played by bob queen of clubs played by cathy jack of hearts played by drew alice takes the trick ace of diamonds led by alice jack of clubs played by bob king of clubs played by cathy ten of diamonds played by drew alice takes the trick what i cant fathom is why drew plays j of hearts in the third round when the lead is diamonds and then when the lead is diamonds in the forth round he follows suit and plays his diamond if he had that diamond in the third round why wouldnt he follow suit to site the spec if a player can follow suit he plays the highest card that follows suit otherwise he plays the lowest card in his hand so i dont see why he wouldnt play his diamonds in round 3 but then does in round 4 thank you
student,for example in maketrump do we have to write the test case when the player has lee than 5 cards in hand and have to choose to make a trump or not will this kind of situation be tested
student,does the operation of add and discard happen in maketrump or we have to put them together in gamecpp
student,can someone explain to my why in test01 the first turn up card is the ace of diamonds i cant seem to understand how that happens shouldnt it be the queen of spades
student,in euchretest01outcorrect in the first trick wouldnt alice want to play her 9 of clubs as a pose to her ace of hearts she does not have any cards in the follow suit so she should play her lowest card right
student,should all of the error checking for number of points and shufflenoshuffle be done in the main function in euchrecpp or should that be done in gameinit it seems like at least most of the checking with the exception of the number of points will have to be done in euchrecpp
student,when i type make test in the command prompt in caen i get this error bash41 make test g pedantic wall werror o1 playertestscpp playercpp cardcpp o playertests g pedantic wall werror o1 euchrecpp gamecpp playercpp packcpp cardcpp o euchre cardtests cardtestsout binsh cardtests permission denied make test error 126 i dont know why it does this can anyone explain
student,im having an issue passing the default playerplaycard test case after debugging i realized that the variable handsize is equal to 4 as soon as i enter the function which is obviously incorrect in my previous playerleadcard function i use playerptrhandsize after rearranging the cards in the array in order to discard the card that was led is the issue of the default handsize 4 throwing off my playerplaycard function an issue with the way i am testing or an issue with my playerleadcard function also what steps would i need to take to fix this issue thanks
student,i kept got random values assigned to hand component of player when i initialize a player sometimes the values make sense but sometimes not i didnt write code to initialize hand in playerinit could anyone help me with that thanks
student,is there some sort of sign up for office hours or do we just go to the spot where they are being held according to the google calendar page
student,so in euchretest01outcorrect we are given this output ive marked where i came up with an issue in that specific trick alice deals a diamond and drew responds by dealing a heart even though we know drew has a diamond as evident in the rest of his plays that hand so what is the ruling here and why in the world was drew allowed to play a heart the instructions say if a player can follow suit he plays the highest card that follows suit otherwise he plays the lowest card clearly in this case drew can follow the suit diamonds but chooses to play hearts for brevity i have just included the very first hand euchre packin shuffle 10 alice bob cathy drew hand 0 alice deals ace of diamonds turned up bob passes cathy passes drew passes alice orders up diamonds ace of spades led by bob nine of hearts played by cathy queen of hearts played by drew ace of hearts played by alice bob takes the trick king of spades led by bob ten of hearts played by cathy king of hearts played by drew queen of diamonds played by alice alice takes the trick jack of diamonds led by alice alice deals diamonds but drew responds with hearts ten of clubs played by bob queen of clubs played by cathy jack of hearts played by drew error here alice takes the trick ace of diamonds led by alice jack of clubs played by bob king of clubs played by cathy ten of diamonds played by drew but wait drew has a diamond cheater alice takes the trick king of diamonds led by alice queen of spades played by bob ace of clubs played by cathy nine of diamonds played by drew but wait drew has another diamond cheater alice takes the trick alice and cathy win the hand alice and cathy have 1 points bob and drew have 0 points
student,the spec says the dealer must order up a suit other than the rejected suit during screw the dealer how do we go about determining which suit the dealer orders up
student,what should gameinit be i understand that it should initialize the names and packs however should it 1 be the players deal cards 2 choosing what the trump card is thanks
student,i was testing my cardcompare function that involves the led suite it didnt pass one of my test cases as a result i want to double check and confirm if i am comparing two cards fivehearts and fiveclubs with a lead card of fivehearts and trump suit of diamonds will fivehearts be higher because it is the suit of the lead card thank you
student,hello everybody i had a couple of questions about gameinit 1 what is the best way to determine whether or not to shuffle currently i have selection statements but to use them as an argument for gameinit i am currently using a global variable which we all know is bad is there a better way maybe calling a function as an argument for gameinit 2 how are we to enter the player names in or rather the root of my problem here is i dont understand the argument definition const char const playernames what exactly does that mean and how can i use it to have 4 input arguments from argv as always thank you all for your help and insight in advance
student,my packinit function seemed to work fine when i tested it in packtestscpp but now when i call it in gameinit it is causing a set fault the actual seg fault occurs in the cardinit function on this line of code cardptrrank staticcastranki the arguments to the function that are causing the bug are as follows cardptr 0x0 rank 0x607428 nine suit 0x607488 spades does anyone have any ideas i know this is not much information any help is appreciated
student,if we pass the proj 3 final autograder tests is there a moreless advisable strategy for further testing in particular is it okay to write a gametestscpp update the makefile accordingly and use this to test the individual gamecpp helper functions as opposed to say putting it all into euchrecpp which would be messy or just running games from the command line which would be a lot of guess work will you be grading on the visible presence of gamecpp test code as in the testscpp for card pack and player or just the correctness of our euchre program
student,can pack has less than 24 cards when we wrote the test case for packinit
student,when i run my packtestscpp file everything executes and i see the packtest pass output however my computer throws me an exception at the end saying runtime check failure 2 stack around the variable pack was corrupted i am running this on microsoft visual studio 2013 on my windows laptop any ideas why the pack variable is getting corrupted this also happened before i submitted for the checkpoint so i believe it has to do with something in packcpp thanks in advance
student,so i read some previous posts about what we do after the checkpoint but i am still confused i made a euchrecpp file and added those checks to make sure it the game was valid using argc and argv and loops what i dont understand is where i am getting these arguments to start the game i feel like this is a super easy disconnect that is really confusing me a lot
student,the spec says the main function coded in euchrecppwill be very simple it should read the command line arguments check them for errors and then print them does this mean we print euchre packin shuffle 10 alice bob cathy drew back out or something
student,the tests you guys gave us for playeraddanddiscard have the comments bob will throw away the upcard if its lower than the cards in his hand and bob will pick up the queen of spades since its higher than his lowest my question if the dealer is called up dont they have to pick up the upcard for example lets say bob has perfect spade hand rb lb a k q and the upcard is a 10 of spades if he was called up wouldnt he still have to pick the upcard
student,whenever i submit to the autograder it flashes a message across the browser window that says something along the lines of submission marked as over submission limit did we only have a limited number of submissions for the final project submission
student,so when i run my code in the terminal it gives me a segmentation fault but when i run it in the debugger it gives me the following message thread 58000x2298 exited with code 0 inferior 1 process 5800 exited normally does anyone know what this means
student,if i want to deal hands to all my players i need to use gameptr to point to the player array and access the hand array within player basically need to do this gameptrplayers1hand0 how would i do that do i need to declare another variable pointer of type player and assign gameptrplayers1 to that and then use that pointer to point to hand or is there an easier way to do that
student,just wanted to make sure i have the order of dealers and eldest hand their movement correct throughout the game is the following correct players are in order 0123 hand 0 dealer is player 0 eldest hand is player 1 hand 1 dealer is player 1 eh is player 2 hand 2 dealer is player 2 eh is player 3 hand 3 dealer is player 3 eh is player 0 and repeat
student,hi all posting here on the off chance that there are others on here at 10 on the tuesday of sb so i am coding euchre game and i see that the output for the second trick is as follows king of clubs led by drew ace of clubs played by alice nine of spades played by bob jack of clubs played by cathy alice takes the trick however in my code im getting king of clubs led by drew ace of clubs played by alice king of hearts played by bob jack of clubs played by cathy bob takes the trick i am frustrated because the first two plays and the last are all correct and the very first trick runs perfect as well i tested the playerplayscard function for this scenario and it agrees that i should be outputting nine of spades for bob is there anything i could be missing testing wise that may be the root of the problem i am avoiding posting code because hc but if an instructor wants it i will post it on a private post i am hoping this is something stupidly obvious that i forgot to check thank you erin
student,can we assume that for the sake of this project numplayers will always equal 4 and numpartnerships will always equal 2
student,i have a little bit of confusion with card rankings say my hand is king of diamonds jack of hearts nine of spades nine of clubs ten of spades if the trump suit is diamonds and the lead card is nine of hearts would the card you play be the jack of hearts or is the jack of hearts now trump and no longer a heart
student,im just having a difficult time calling the gameinit function in the euchre file because of the two constant char parameters that are passed through do i have to loop through for the four last argv elements and call gameinit each time
student,ive posted a couple times about segmentation fault 11 after a few hours of messing around with gdb and valgrind i found the error now make test passes it compiles on linux no more seg faults valgrind even displays 11072 error summary 0 errors from 0 contexts suppressed 0 from 0 but it still will not compile in the autograder and i dont know where to go from here any suggestions it passes through two suggested debuggers
student,are we to open the pack in euchrecpp or just in gameplay
student,what should be the order of the card distribution and what does deal 3232 cards then 2323 cards mean say the 4 players are 0123 then should they be receiving the cards in the order of 000 11 222 33 00 111 22 333 or 0123 0123 0123 0123 0123 thanks
student,im just confused on how to do the file are we to consider euchre in the count of argc also are we supposed to loop through the command line and test that each element of the argv array is appropriate or are we just supposed to test the line for the respective errors that were listed in the spec
student,ive been having trouble with the second autograder test for euchrecpp would this mean that there is a problem specifically with the file euchrecpp or could it also be a problem with gamecpp also im guessing that we cant know what exactly the autograder test cases are but could you provide some examples of the most common mistakes with euchrecpp and gamecpp
student,
student,while working on xcode my project 3 code compiles fine and runs but it didnt compile in the autograder i tested the code on caen and i get a seg fault 11 which is somewhere i am accessing or trying to access bad memory or whatever so i spent an hour and a half to get gdb configured and signed on my mac and run my code and the seg fault disappears so it runs with no error i read up that a good program to use in this case is valgrind but i cant find a good tutorial or how to install it correctly i can only get a seg fault in terminal but it doesnt point me in any direction does anyone know what i should do next
student,following the example in the spec where a is the dealer and b is the leader d c b a when drew wins the trick does the order become c b d a and after each hand does the order become a d c b regardless of any changes in leaders between tricks
student,if so why and if anyone is nice enough how
student,how can drew play this card in line 25 jack of hearts played by drew when the card that is led is jack of diamonds and drew has a diamond card in his hand doesnt the spec say that during play a player must play the highest rank card of the same suit that was led
student,will we be penalized for having a long gameplay function ours is about 220 lines right now even though we wrote some helper functions is it worth our timenecessary to break it up further thanks
student,if shuffle is enabled should it be performed before the very first hand hand 0
student,test case playertest00 failed to compile test case euchretest00 failed to compile test case euchretest01 failed to compile it wont actually compile or not enough tests what does that mean
student,needed clarification on what exactly the error message in euchrecpp should be do we just exit without an error message the spec gives says it should print the following message and quit cout usage euchre packfilename shufflenoshuffle pointstowin name1 name2 name3 name 4 so if my input was euchre packin shuffle 0 bob bob what would the error message be obviously this is wrong because of the points being out of bounds and only 2 players
student,i have no trouble grabbing one of the four players but when i try to grab a further element of said player like their name i am unable to get past the compiler any thoughts on this
student,trying to initialize a card using next with the proper rank and suit enums like such cardinitpackptrnext rank2 suit2 getting an access violation when the line is reached in vs does something need to be done with next before we can initialize it with the rank and suit that we read in from the file
student,does the input file need to be packin or can it be any other file name
student,hello i am a bit lost as how to implement the following first print the executable and all arguments on the first line print a single space at the end which makes it easier to print an array euchre packin noshuffle 1 alice bob cathy drew how do i grab the arguments in order to print them
student,when initializing the pack in gameptr why is this illegal packinitgameptrpack packfilename
student,im having trouble assigning names from playernames into gameptrplayersname and the rest of the players array can someone give me any hints on how to do this assignment ik that playernames is a const char const and the name for each player in the players array is just a char so the types differ
student,when i compared my output for euchretests00 using diff i got the correct answer however when i run the autogravder it says test case euchretest00 failed to compile euchretest00 04 does anyone know why this happens i can compile it in terminal
student,i understand we need to write tests to check if our functions work but will our tests be graded against how they do on purposely buggy functions
student,hello with euchrecpp are we to assume that the users are typing everything into the command line interface like are they typing all of the commands out or is the computer just reading predefined commands simply are we to be using cin for this part
student,are we required to test andor modify the functions provided in the cardcppstarter or can we assume that they work perfectly sorry if this was already answered
student,the result seems correct while diff say no i dont know what does no newline at end of file means
student,will the order of the arguments always be the same in the main function in other words can we assume itll be pack shufflenoshuffle pts to win player1 player2 player3 player4 every time or do we need to check for that
student,if another game is played with the same players the new dealer is the player to the left of the dealer in the previous game right thank you
student,hello im just having a difficult time differentiating between what is supposed to go in euchrecpp and the gameplay function in gamecpp can someone please explain how they are different thank you
student,from the spec before you begin think about which helper functions you would like to add and what they should do for example functions that shuffle deal and make trump are a good starting point didnt we already implement a bool shuffle function in packcpp why is it suggested that we write another one
student,i see that the gameinit function modifies stdout so is the function supposed to print something out if so i cannot figure out what this would be thanks
student,wouldnt this variable always be 10 since the spec says a team needs to score 10 points in order to win
student,using a for loop to check if there any cards in the players hand which have the same suit as the led card how do you suggest going about finding the highest rank of that suit though should we make a temporary array with all the cards that have the same suit as the led card and use card compare to find the highest one or should we just call card compareabtrump passing in the led suit as the trump that way the highest card would evaluate to the highest led card whats the best way to do this
student,does anyone have any recommendations on how to diff the outputs of my program vs the correct outputs for some reason whenever i try to copy paste stuff from xcode into any diff checker it adds these huge random spaces that make it useless
student,anyone else having issues right now with vnc
student,i know the project spec says do not use memory allocation including keywords like new malloc etc but can i use them in my testing files
student,when it says that the main function should read in the command line arguments check for errors and print them is it saying that we should print out the actual arguments or do we just have to print the error statement
student,when dealing do you deal to player 1 2 3 0 if it is the first deal and 0 is the dealer or 3 2 1
student,i got the wrong output so i was wondering if the player addanddiscard card playcard or leadcard is supposed to change where the card is in a pack
student,my program was running 95 correctly with 1 or 2 output errors i made a change to a function which does not call suitnext in any way and now suitnext is giving me assertion failureanyone have any ideas why this may be happening
student,ten of diamonds led by alice ten of spades played by bob nine of clubs played by cathy queen of clubs played by drew alice takes the trick this is the 3rd trick from test00outcorrect my code says drew should win the case so the trump suit is hearts which doesnt affect the order of ten of diamonds drew has a queen of clubs which clearly has a higher order than ten of diamonds why alice wins
student,what is this pointer i thought it was the euchre pointer in the command line arguments but of course thats not a pointer to a game so it isnt a viable input
student,what kind of tests is main supposed to run like to test that the inputs are strings or integers
student,the specification states the simulator checks for the following errors points to win the game is between 1 and 100 inclusive can we assume that the parameter is an integer or is the range check in addition to checking that it is in fact an integer
student,my code is include iostream using namespace std void changeconst int aptrptr aptrptr int main int a2 12 int aptr a changeaptr the result from terminal in very interesing tcpp1115 error invalid conversion from ‘int’ to ‘const int’ fpermissive i remember that in class professor said that its ok to pass a variable as const variable as argument but i wonder why here it isnt the case
student,i just reread the spec and it says that cards ordering is trump suit and then rank follows in suit order so will the suit of the lead card affect the suit order or not
student,after printing the whole command line arguments and then when i tried to get the file name its disappeared cout argv1 endl code to print the whole command line arguements cout argv1 endl this code should print p euchre packin shuffle 10 ab cd ef gh p but somehow it just prints p euchre packin shuffle 10 ab cd ef gh empty line i dont understand why the content in argv just disappeared
student,when i run euchrecpp with noshuffle it runs flawlessly when i run it with shuffle i get the error appearing above i only use suitnext once in my program in the playercpp and in that file i pass a suit directly into the function as specified by the function requirements does anyone know why this error is occurring
student,if you get below a c in eecs 280 you cannot proceed to 281 correct can eecs280 be retaken if you fail it thanks
student,im having some trouble figuring out how to refer to all the player names in the gameinit call in euchrecpp i initially created a game pointer of type game and used that in a call to games member players like this gameptrplayers but i get an error that says no known conversion from player 4 to const char const could someone lend any hints on how to approach this
student,i am confused as to where to start for gamecpp are we supposed to implement gameinit or leave it alone can someone lead me in the right direction of how to begin working on gameplay thank you
student,despite many days of work i did not do as well as i hoped on the exam i hope to use this exam as a learning experience to improve on the final where i will put in many weeks of work instead of many days in order to learn from my mistakes i would like to see how my exam was graded how do we go about doing this
student,whats the exam average how is it curved
student,if an array name is the same thing as a pointer to the first element of the array i understand assuming that types match that it is permissible to assign a pointer to an array name why is it not allowed to assign a pointer to an array name
student,after calling gameinit in my euchrecpp it warns me that gameptr may be uninitialized when i try to call gameplay anyone have a similar errorsolution i was under the assumption we werent intended to alter gameinit
student,if the first hand didnt reach the points to win which pack should we use to deal in the second hand or even the third hand is it always deal the pack in the previous hand
student,rob has office hour tomorrow its spring break but if thats the case i might come will he be there
student,as per the spec we inserted gameplay in our int main but for some reason the code never runs it just passes over gameplay and prints whatever cout statements we have below for example gameplay cout gameplay is running endl int main game g cout before gameplay endl gameplayg cout after gameplay endl our output is before gameplay after gameplay help please
student,is anyone else getting this error its coming directly from cardh where enum suit is in fact declared when i run my tests on card pack and player they all work properly it crashed when i try to compile euchrecpp
student,for gamecpp i made playedcards function that returns the pointer to an array of played cards when i use for loop to print the cards in the array it prints correctly but when i print it in gameplay it does not print correctly it prints an impossible card like three of spades any suggestion
student,several times throughout my program i reference gameptrplayernames the array of names of each player initialized by gameinit and listed as a member of the struct in the header file i keep getting an error stating that struct game has no such member variable does anyone know of any solution to this problem or experienced something similar
student,when will the project 3final autograder be up
student,is rob here for office hours or did he forgot to take it off the calendar
student,is there an easy way to use labster for debugging for project 3
student,the example code to run the main game uses a euchrecpp file however there is none included in the starter code and no mention of it in the spec are we supposed to code a euchrecpp calling the main function from game
student,i am trying to compile my gamecpp file and i am receiving compiler errors involving the lines of code written for us in gameinit are we supposed to modify these lines of code
student,our maketrump function returns a suit in order to know what trump is but we are running into the problem of not know which team called the trump any tipssuggestions to get us on the right track
student,good luck on the exam
student,struct basket string fruits points to an array of fruits int numfruits size of array void printbasket const basket basket forint i basketfruits i basketfruitsnumfruits i what i think this does is initialize a pointer to the first index in the fruits array then it increments through the array one at a time until it reaches the end cout basketfruitsi since basketfruits is a pointer and not a value a figured you need to dereference it i just dont understand how to use the syntax for pointer math on variables inside a structure i get the rest of this class pretty much 100
student,double var4 int
student,would this return line be tailresursive for any basic fn that takes two ints int fnint x int y code code return fn x fn x y assume this does not amount to an infinite loop of any sorts
student,i know that argv0 contains either nonsense or the executable name depending on the compiler but is it still technically the first argument passed to the program in the command line or is that argv1 i understand the difference and how argv works but for the sake of an exam question is argv0 a program argument
student,for a problem like fall 2014 4c are we allowed to use a helper function even though there is no space to actually write one the problem does not specify we are not allowed to so i was wondering if it would be acceptable to write the helper function below the countoccurrences function and then draw an arrow to indicate that the helper function has to come ahead of the original function i know that this function can be implemented wo a helper but often times it is easier for me figure out the way using helpers tldr can we use helpers on the exam even if the problem doesnt give us space to write them out
student,is there anyway for us to print the trees to check if the program works labster says treeprint is not in scope
student,how do we know which loops for and while to use when you are traversing using pointers specifically on the fall midterm exam my friends used for loop to go through the borrowed books but i used while loop to go through are both valid answers my answer was book ptr patron borrowedbooks while ptr if ptr ischeckedout return false ptr return true
student,what are situations in which we would need to use the this pointer to access member variables the only thing i can think of is if a member function is declared outside the class does not explicitly take a type of that class as an input and still needs to modify member variables is my understanding correct any more detailstips would be appreciated
student,quick question on const syntax if there is some function int xconst char s and you pass it a regular char pointer not const does that just mean the value pointed to cannot be changed by the function or will you get a compiler error thanks
student,can a main function be voidstatic
student,if there is a box designated to a pointer because it technically is only a pointer is it correct that we never write a value inside it as in we only ever write what it points to and if i added an additional line of code to the line above ptr arr1 the pointer now has a value of 2 would i write 2 inside the ptr box or do i not write anything because ptr is only a ptr thank you
student,can anyone tell me where aud ns is i cant seem to find it on any campus map
student,could someone explain when and why you have to declare a cstring const when initializing it thanks
student,int x y allocate ptrs but not pointees int a 1 x a cout x x endl x 42 cout a a endl y 13 cout y y endl y x cout y y “ a a endl i think here y hasnt been initialized am i right
student,if you initialize a string with char s100 hello where is the null character located right after the hello or at the end of the hundred locations reserved for s also what is in the empty spaces
student,void insertchar str char spotconst char toinsert int len strlentoinsert forchar i spot i spot len i ilen i i toinsert this was the way i did 4b however looking back at it i was wondering if the first line it the for loop is valid it compiles perfectly fine but why isnt ilen accessing an invalid location
student,how do you access the items in fruits because it is a pointer to a string would it be for int i0 ibasketnumfruits i coutbasketfruitsi
student,hi i know that the first thing to be couted will be x 1 then a 42 but im not really sure what will happen after that does the uninitialized y point to some random int space in memory some clarification would be great thanks int x y allocate ptrs but not pointees int a 1 x a cout x x endl x 42 cout a a endl y 13 cout y y endl y x cout y y “ a a endl
student,is there only one correct answer because it doesnt specify if the tree is a balanced tree or not i can create a lot of different trees from that list i think its possible that this tree will also have the same list 90 27 55 14 32 64 19
student,suppose that i had this code struct course string coursename int credithours struct student string studentname course arrmax int numcourses int main student a student aptr a assuming that my student member variable was properly initialized how could i traverse through the array arr and dereference both members of course aptr i believe this code will shift the pointer to an undefined memory location however this also does not seem to be working for me aptrarr aptrarrcoursename aptrarrcredithours thanks in advance
student,do we have lecture tomorrow thanks
student,i wasnt able to stay for the entire midterm review session last saturday so i missed the review of this question any recommendationshints on how to approach this problem
student,i started the practice problems in labster and am stuck on this replace tree function i first started with the base case in which the tree is empty then if the tree is not empty i check to see if the top tree element is equal to the value x or not if it is then i replace it with the value of y then i created treet l which recursively calls replace function again with left tree of the tree and then i also created treet r which calls replace function but this time with right tree of the tree then as the return call i called treemake with tree element l and r for some odd reason nothing is getting replaced i dont know what is wrong with my logic and i would like some help thanks
student,kind of late but i didnt receive an email telling me which exam room to go to what can i do to resolve this before the exam tomorrow
student,im in aud ns and i would like to confirm the location thanks
student,whats the difference between int ptr2 z and ptr2 z they ultimately point at z right so is it the same thing
student,if i have a code that reads char hat4 hat char hall5 hall for int i 0 i 6 i if hat i hall i cout wow of course hat isnt hall cout there is something amiss in denmark will this still be considered traversal by pointer or is the following the definition forint ptr arr ptr arr k ptr
student,how many labs can we missfail
student,i dont understand the rme by the way the rme sounds to me it seems like the example it gives spam should be changed to hham because youre replacing str and str 1 with the new character this is probably silly but this is really tripping up my brain due to some developmental disabilities i have trouble with language could anyone word this in a different way
student,sorry that this is probably a dumb question but how do you initialize an array of cstrings ive been searching for this for way too long now and ive tried a bunch of stuff but i cant get anything to work so i would want an array like joe bobetc
student,when writing functions for binary trees on the exam is it okay if we create helper functions
student,will grading on problems on the exams be all or nothing or will there be room for partial credit
student,i went to oh today for number 4 on exam 2015 to make sure my logic was correct g still says i am going outside of the bounds of the c string it assumes that my c string starts with mover therefore i cannot access any addresses before the pointer how do i get g to realize that my array actually begins before my mover pointer using namespace std void replacechar start char end char newchar int dist end start char mover formover end mover 0 mover mover dist 1 mover start newchar mover dist 1 0 int main char str spam ham replacestr str 2 h return 0
student,in lecture 07 we talk about another way to code the strcpy function is void strcpychardest const charsrc while dest src so i know since thats a single equals sign thats not considered a boolean expression so does this loop just run till dest or src is equal to false or the null character in this case
student,when they say no array indexing how are we supposed to access elements do they want us to use traversal by pointer if someone could show me any example where they didnt use array indexing it would be really helpful thanks
student,so for instance if we were asked to write the treedepth function on the test as described in the fall 2014 midterm question 3 would we be allowed to make a small helper function that we call for the implementation of this function or should we avoid doing this
student,for this function i made a code that changes every to therefore changing every to but i am not sure how to go about comparing two characters rather than just one aka making sure the array contain rather than just any tips on this code thanks
student,this may be a silly question but do we need comments on implemented functions on tests you know to clarify things or something im expecting a no
student,i am so confused about what cstrings are here is what i figured out cstrings are a sequence of chars terminating with a 0 there are only 4 ways to initialize a cstring not including strcpy 1const char s red 2char a yellow 3char b b l u e 0 4string h purple const char y hcstr you can do char char but not the other way around this last point confuses me the most i thought no matter how you initialize it its a cstring so you should be able to char and assign to it a pointer to a char im just confused in terms of are there two types of cstrings ones that are an array and ones that are just a pointer to char i thought they were the same thing but they arent acting how i would expect if they were the same thing
student,void printbasketconst basket basket for int i 0 i basketnumfruits i cout basketfruitsi endl this is what i got but it doesnt feel right i tried the same code with card from project3 but it only prints the address rather than whats in that address what should be answer be
student,include iostream include cstring using namespace std void strconcatenatechar dst char src int main char dst14 hello const char src7 world strconcatenatedst src return 0 void strconcatenatechar dst char src while dst dst strcpydst src return the error is argument of type const char is incompatible with parameter of type char does it mean that we should always use const char as the argument of a function rather than char to avoid error like this if so i made the following change include iostream include cstring using namespace std void strconcatenatechar dst const char src int main char dst14 hello const char src7 world strconcatenatedst src return 0 void strconcatenatechar dst const char src while dst dst strcpysdst src visual studio forces me to use strcpys return but i still get errors no instance of overloaded function strcpys matches the argument list argument types are char const char strcpys function does not take 2 arguments but when i compile using g the same code with strcpy rather than strcpys of course there is no error thus can anyone make it compile in visual studio using strcpys thans a lot
student,for 4a on fall 14 two lines of my code involved this return stringequalshelpera b true when i tried compiling this netbeans gave me an error and flagged a and b i changed it to a1 and b 1 and everything worked how come a and b is invalid
student,at 5723 in deorios 1030 lecture on abstract data types lecture 10 he presents the most efficient code for checking if a triangle created is geometrically possible since i watched the lecture online and didnt know the parameters for a triangle off the top of my head i looked them up and read this the length of a side of a triangle is less than the sum of the lengths of the other two sides and greater than the difference of the lengths of the other two sides i wasnt sure how much you can input into the assert function so i broke it down to three boolean variables beforehand and asserted those include cmath triangletriangleainbincin aain bbin ccin bool aside false bool bside false bool cside false if a b c a absb c aside true if b a c b absa c bside true if c b a c absb a aside true assertaside bside cside i understand i could eliminate the booleans and if statements and run the inequalities in the assert function my question is deorios most efficient example doesnt recognize the second rule greater than the difference of the lengths of the other two sides i just want to know if that inequality matters and deorio missed it or if its unnecessary because a bc b a c c a b is logicially equivalent to the boolean logic in my code
student,are we allowed to hand write out cheat sheet but then laminate it
student,whenever i have a for loop that looks something like for char i a i 0 i with some code inside the for loop im always stuck in an infinite loopwhy does this happen i thought that eventually the i would point to 0 at the end of the cstring a but it just keeps going
student,i did it but i think my code is pretty redundant and i am not even sure if itll correctly work 5c is about ischeckedout
student,i was doing some testing code to figure out how cstrings and strcpy worked and im getting a really weird error this is my code int main char ble4 b c g 0 char he3 h h0 char fun2 ble he cout fun01 endl char s strcpys ble cout ble endl it outputs c run command line 1 13610 bus error 10 2 3
student,can someone tell me in printarraybar1 4 what does it mean when we pass bar1 into the function is bar a pointer thank you
student,on the exam if we are asked to open a file will we also have to write include fstream or will the problem state it already
student,mentioned in p2 of spring practice exam
student,is it necessary to set the characters after the shortened array equal to null for example if i moved down the characters such that the str array was now str hamm would i need to do something along the lines of whats below str3 0 alternatively is there an easier approach to this problem
student,in these problems on cstrings when it says you may not declare any temporary arrays or cstrings this doesnt mean you cannot have a counter cstring in a for loop right i assumed this was allowed since it said use traversal by pointer
student,if argv is an array of pointers why dont you have to dereference it so argvi to access the element cstring it is actually pointing to in a normal cstring such as char a foo it would make sense that a1 or a 1 gives us the char f but why would argv1 give us the entire c string wouldnt it just give us the char pointer at the 2nd element of its array but not the object being pointed to
student,in 1a should line 5 be cout i if it was cout i wouldnt it print the address of elements of ary
student,can someone explain their answers for these i got that they do differ
student,so say i have the following struct below struct hotel int room would the code below be correct or in other words the dereference operator only applies to hotel and not to the room member which is still a pointer correct const hotel hotel int x 4 hotelroom x
student,i was told by my gsi last week that we would not be tested on classes but in the review lecture on monday classes were mentioned please clarify thanks
student,there seems to be a lot of back and forth on this so could you give me a definitive list including const ifwhere needed as well thanks so much
student,couldnt remember the output pasted into visual compiler does not like y 13 uninitialized variable pretty tired cant think of why its not working or what i should initialize it to that doesnt make the program crash or change the output int x y allocate ptrs but not pointees int a 1 x a cout x x endl x 42 cout a a endl y 13 unitialized cout y y endl y x cout y y “ a a endl
student,im a little unclear on the ways to create a cstring to my understanding the three ways below are valid ways to create a cstring but itd be great if someone could validate this const char str word const char str2 word const char str3 word
student,how can the following two lines of code be translated into an english sentence double var4int int var5
student,so on the exam of winter 2013 there are problems with try and catch statement thingies i dont know what to call them because i havent really seen them before are we expected to know these
student,for 2d on sp14 i was wondering how it is possible to make older such that the order or its fruits array may be changed in addition to its value for numfruits i figured i could just add the operator ie oldernumfruits fn to change the value of numfruits but i am not sure how to call fn to change the value to which the actual pointer is pointing and not just the value to which the copy of the pointer in fn is pointing i thought about calling it as follows funolderfruits oldernumfruits eat i thought this would give me a compiler error though since the eatfruit asks for string fruit and not the address of the pointer of string fruit
student,if i passed a constructor an array as input can i set a private member variable array equal to the input array using an initializer list for example private int memberarraymaxarraysize public constructorint array memberarrayarray
student,how are you supposed to know when there are no elements remaining if treeleft and treeright require the trees arent empty for example 3 how can i know that 3 is the only number without using treeleft or treeright what other functions do we have at our use for this
student,why isnt const char str1 spam a valid cstring
student,if a function has a pointer for an argument ex bool hasmaxbooksconst patron patron do we need to pass in an address of a pointer or simply pass in a pointer do we need to do hasmaxbookspatron or hasmaxbookspatron or are both correct
student,sorry if this is an obvious question but if i am defining a function and its parameters such as the function func on the midterm exam problem 2d is int y the same as int y thanks
student,i think these that three ways of declare a function pointer pointing to a function which returns a function pointer are the same but there will be error report for my first expression can anyone tell me where is the problem i get it from the end of chapter 67 of our textbook
student,how would i interpret dest src like do i increment the src pointer by 1 then dereference it and set that value equal to the next dest pointer that line of code is used in the lecture slides to describe strcpy void strcpy char dest const char src while src dest src dest 0
student,are pointers pass by value or reference if you pass a pointer into the function it is possible to change what the pointer is pointing at as well as the pointers location right also when do you use an when passing in pointers from spring 2014 2c printbasketb1 obviously uses a but im not sure how this is different from printbasketb1
student,i remember that in a lecture we were told that a struct could only contain data but isnt it the struct in pure c isnt the struct in c kind of the same as class
student,im trying to test one of my solutions to an exam problem but every time i try to declare a cstring to test with like so char str spam i get a compiler error
student,what is the difference between null and nullptr
student,for this question are we allowed to make copy of str using strcpy or any other method of copying
student,what is the format of the exam will there be multiple choice or just free response
student,for fall 2014 is this drawing correct or should there just be an arrow drawn from the a box to the third box in the array should there be another box drawn to represent the pass by reference b
student,for the second one int listlength listt list int sofar 0 if listisemptylist return sofar return listlengthlistrestlist sofar1 i am assuming this function is supposed to return the length of a list i think the function is recursive and tail recursive since it calls itself and does not require any more calculation after the return however is this function good code i think that every time the function recurses sofar gets set back to 0 therefore wont the function just return 0 no matter what
student,title should be selfexplanatory thanks
student,so on problem 1c i was dead certain that the output should be 42 45 46 46 but when i compiled the code and ran it it came out to be 42 45 46 45 i have seen it with my own eyes but i still dont believe it could someone explain why the output is the way it is
student,does anyone know what the following compiler error means lab03 in function start text0x0 multiple definition of start usrlibgccx8664redhatlinux447lib64crt1otext0x0 first defined here im getting it for a bunch of the functions when when i try to compile lab 03 with the optional part thanks
student,i am just wondering what is the benifit of using else if as compared to more if statements for example if n 2 cout odd else if n 2 cout even compared to if n 2 cout odd if n 2 cout even
student,am i reading these correctly my solution 1 var1 is a pointer to a function that takes no arguments and returns a pointer to an integer 2 var2 is an array of size 3 of pointers to functions that take intdouble as arguments and return a bool 3 var3 is a pointer to a double 4 var4 is a pointer to a function that takes no arguments and also returns a pointer to a function which takes an int as an argument and returns a double 5 var5 is a pointer to a pointer to an int what does this even mean like conceptually
student,im pretty sure in vidals review we talked about how the answer for 2c is just the original b1 list apple banana cumquat date eggplant i dont fully understand why arent we setting the older pointer equal to the newer pointer in update so dont they both point to the same thing now so that any changes on newer should also happen to older
student,in the spec its suggested that we use a helper function called gameshuffle and in the effects clause it says if the shuffle option is selected shuffle the pack does the shuffle option in the effects imply that we need to take that from the command line argument again
student,in our gameinit implementation we have a couple cout statements just to check that pack player are initializing however when we run euchre with the appropriate arguments none of the cout statements that we put in gameinit are printing what could be going wrong
student,will we find filestream andor templates on the midterm
student,so if i have int foo int bar would bar foo and bar foo do the same thing
student,are the following c string declarations valid const char const str2 s p a m 0 const char const str3 spam
student,when writing the code for a constructor for a class rectangle with member data a and b are both of following correct 1 rectangledouble ain double bin aain bbin 2 rectangledouble ain double bin a ain b bin if both are correct whats the difference between them
student,na
student,was going over lecture slides and a bit confused on this concept can anyone clarify on what a sink is and what a source is and the difference between the two
student,i am working through the practice exams taking the entire exam within a time limit and then after finishing i am going through the exam and testing out my answers on visual studio to check for correctness when going through 4 in the example in the effects clause of the rme it gives an example char str spam however when i run this kind of variable in my void replace function the compiler yells at me for trying to access and change a literal string i then changed char str spam to char str spam and my code worked fine outputting the correct answer given in the exam example is there something that i am doing wrong to make my code not work with the given example in the exam ie char str spam instead of char str spam or is there something i need to keep in mind when working with char str thanks in advance for any help
student,can we do patronborrowedbooksi ischeckedout assuming there is for loop going from i 0 to imaxborrwedbooks i so forint i 0 imaxborrowedbooks i ifpatronborrowedboksiischeckedout
student,in the following slide i was wondering how to determine the sizeofint on this machine i see that this has to do with the addresses provided but what does the c mean at the end of three out of the four provided addresses maybe im interpreting this wrong and i dont need to be thinking about that but could someone please clear this up for me thanks
student,is this right
student,hey so for problem 4a which requires us to use tail recursion to see if two c strings are equal it says we cant use array indexing is this only in the body of our code or in the function call because if we can not use indexing in the recursive function call im not quite sure how to go through each element of the string
student,i have no idea how to do this without implementing a helper function to accommodate a count int variable can anyone help me out
student,lets say the trump ordered up suit is clubs and a player has a jack of spades in hisher hand then the ledcard for a trick is also a spade the spec says that the person should play the highest card in hisher hand that follows suit of the ledcard but since the jack of spades is the left bower it is considered a club does this also mean it is no longer considered a spade for the above situation or should the person play it if heshe has no other larger spades in hisher hand i finished my whole project then ran into this during the large example test case
student,my plan of action was to loop through str backwards and shift the elements after spot back the length of toinsert but im having trouble coding my loop how do we find the back of str when it already has 100 spots most of which are empty
student,how can i change the length of a cstring so you can return ham instead of spam i cant think of how one would do that without adding shifting everything forward and adding additional null characters at the end is there a typo in the example in 4 that we would return hham instead of ham
student,i know there wont be discussion section but will we still have a lab due at the end of the week
student,what is a nonsense test case i remember we covered this in lecture but forget which one could anyone give an example of that thanks
student,am i correct with my answers for the following why is line 3 different you are moving the pointer to an undefined location s izeofint on this machine not sure about this one if you changed it to x1 p 0
student,i just have no idea how i would start drawing the original tree so far i have yes its a pathetic treeplease help me
student,if i have the loop for traversing an array by pointer for int i 0 i patronborrowedcount i why does the answer have just patronborrowedcount does the borrowedcount not have to be dereferenced because its just an int and not a pointer to an int
student,is the first one int factorialint n tailrecursive or not i checked this with the labster and it said it is but since the function is not calling itself its not even a recursion how could it be a tail recursion then i checked with the lecture ppt where it says tailrecursion iteration so every loop is tailrecursive
student,this is the question and then we need to put the things in the boxes in memory int x y z int a 3 7 1 5 int foo int bar fooa bar foo2 xfoobar ya a2 abar foo 1 so i got that foo points to the first value in the array a 3 bar points to the 3rd element in a 1 x 13 but how would you figure out what y is equal to
student,does anyone have the answer to this one i couldnt get it
student,found a charger at vidals midterm review session its on top of the severe weather metal case at dow 1013 if youve lost it and you wanna check if its yours
student,what is the difference between int foo3 int and int foo int 3
student,is caen down for anyone else right now im using the caen vnc for windows to access and i get a timeout error i was using it for a while then it booted me off saying the connection timed out and i cant reconnect is anyone else having this issue
student,join me in thanking vidal for hosting the awesome review session
student,will there be answers to the practice midterms
student,i havent gotten a grade back for lab 01 yet i definitely submitted it i have the submission email should i be worried
student,for example diff listtestoutcorrect listtestout and listtest tee listtestout or commands that allow you to save file as submittar
student,hey i wrote a function strchr outlined below char strchrchar s char search while s if s search return s else s return 0 int main string z welcome char b b strchrzcstr o cout b endl return 0 when i try to compile the compiler complains that in the line b strchrzcstr o i am assigning a const char value to a char why is this the case when i change the declaration of b to const char b the program works any help would be appreciated thanks
student,would just like to see if i got this right would anyone like to share their answers for 1b
student,i was looking at the syllabus again and im a bit confused what do discussion exercises refer to labs
student,why is return listlengthlistrestlist sofar1 for the function int listlength listt list int sofar 0 tail recursive and why is return listmakelistfirstlist filterevenlistrestlist not tail recursive for the function listt filterevenlistt list i remember in lecture that it was stated to be tail recursive if no work has to be done in the function call for the listlength function it has to get the next node in the linked list using listrest and it adds 1 to sofarso why is that tail recursive
student,will the format of the upcoming exam be more similar to the one in fall 2014 with the drawing out and short answer and all that i liked that better
student,is there a way to test our gamecpp functions as we write them it seems like we have to play an entire game to do that but that means writing the game first without any prior testing
student,will we have recordings for vidals review session today
student,are we still supposed to finish two surveys for each labs i cannot find survey emails since lab05
student,do we need to write test cases for every function or only the ones that we had to implement ourselves for example most of the functions in cardcpp were implemented for us do we still need to test all of those
student,would anyone mind sharing their approach to 3b and their tree for 3a on the spring exam im not very good with trees and could use the help
student,idk if it would be wise given the time limit however are we allowed to write helper functions on exams
student,im approaching this function as a simpler version of traversal but im having trouble with what my code should do when i reaches a dead end and another branch has a longer depth how can i avoid double counting the depth when i return from one branch of the tree to the next
student,what exactly does it mean that the implementation should use an initializer list see lecture 10 to set the posxvel and yvelmember variables from a point2dand two doubles passed in as parameters
student,anyone know when the list of eecs classes being offered for spring term will be released and if thats already out if theres a link to see that thatd be much appreciated thanks
student,where do we find these
student,where do i get gameptr for gameinit
student,i had a question concerning the use of additional constructors besides the default constructor so the purpose of the default constructor is to initialize our variables right is the purpose to an additional constructor simply assigning different values to the variables the way we did it in lab 6 seems to suggest this with the initialization list in the new constructors implementation also does this mean that we should be mentioning that xvel yvel and pos get modified in our header file rme thanks in advance
student,i already saw 1169 im assuming it is also ok if we work alone on project 3 after the checkpoint
student,when it says exam 1 will be the first thing that he will go over is this going to be the fall 2014 exam or the spring 2014 exam
student,where are the office hours located in the ugli
student,anyone going to vidals review session and have wheels he needs food and i will help provide some of it but ive got no ride to go get it lets organize what we need to get and make it happen it would suck to get there and end up with a everyone bringing the equivalent of a case of cough drops and cookies and nothing else so whos got wheels and who will throw down some cash to help make it happen please respond here
student,will we get an autograder summary for the project 3 checkpoint like we did for projects 1 and 2
student,ive been testing and my other pack functions are working as expected packreset works when i use it in conjunction with my packdealone tests but i tried to shuffle a pack and reset it with this function and nothing happened i dont think its meant to reset the shuffled thing right ie does it make any pack back into the original form
student,will slides from the exam review be posted online after the review
student,the way i implemented playeraddanddiscard was to check my hand against the upcard and if my worst card was worse than the upcard then i replaced that card with the up card will this not work for any reason on the test cases do i actually need to discard the bad card somehow before i add the upcard
student,everything is working right now except for this one line of code in playertests assert strcmpalicename alice 0 every time i call the function i get a segmentation fault 11 error its so frustrating ive called alicename on a separate line and that works fine ive called strcmpalicename alice on a separate line and that works too literally everything else in my program is working except for this one line and this line causes me to get a point off in the autograder any ideas thanks
student,is there any difference between const char s and const char s
student,so i passed all of the tests except for packtest00 and cardtest00 does anyone know what these two tests test
student,void replacechar start char end char newchar for char i start i end i i newchar start end void problem4 char start spam this is apparently deprecated char start spam char end start2 char newchar h replace start end newchar cout start endl running problem4 gives me the output hham how do we go about getting ham start end gives the same output as the above more specifically how do i use char pointers to truncate the first whatever letters in a char array
student,while doing pack testing from the terminal all the assert functions pass and i get the output pack tests pass or whatever it is supposed to say but when i submit to the autograder i dont get points for packtest00 i am using ssh in my terminal to run through caen so there are no errors due to using xcode or anything else i also downloaded a fresh new copy of packtests from google docs incase somehow i fudged it while testing anyone have any idea whats going on here
student,just to double check im understanding the spec trump will never be a cross suit relative to the up card right if the up card is club there is no way diamonds or hearts could be trump for that hand right
student,example seen in some sample test code card card ace diamonds
student,after a shuffle shall the packinit mean to only reset the next pointer to the current first card or shall the whole pack array return to the initial order
student,for packinit we are expected to use packin but we also have to write a test case for it my partner and i wrote a random pack generator but we cant turn in our text file of a randomly generated pack therefore all of our assert functions in our test case for the randomly generated pack are going to fail how are we supposed to test packinit in this case
student,does anyone know what could be causing this to not compile please advise
student,trying to understand what this function is supposed to do and which card is exactly the weakest card so if i have the following hand jack diamonds ten spades nine clubs ten clubs jack clubs and the upcard is nine spades and i run playeraddanddiscard on this player with this hand should the player add the nine of spades because spades will now be considered trump and discard nine clubs would the player only not pick up the nine of spades if heshe had all other trump cards of higher rank
student,we coded our project in xcode and used two variable length arrays while writing our player functions when compiling in g we received two compiler errors for using variable length arrays as they compile fine in xcode but not in g is there a way to get around this
student,im trying to debug my code for whatever reason packinit is not working obviously im doing something wrong but i dont know what in packtests i want to print out the first card in the deck to make sure that im reading packin correctly when i try to run cardprintfirstcard i get an error for attempting to convert a card to a const card ive tried calling cardprintpacknext which no longer upsets the data type conversion but says i need a semi colon before my bracket so im sure that line what i tried is just completely wrong i am operating under the assumption that packnext is the same as packnext but i tried cardprintpacknext and get a completely different error base operand of has nonpointer type pack i guess adding structures to the mix is confusing me with const and pointers but i cant figure out how to input something to make this function work i am obviously missing a concept about data types and pointers here but im trying and trying and googling and googling i cant figure it out
student,i know this was already asked but all of the first letters in our files were capitalized i dont understand how it could compile for packtests but not packtest00 does anyone have any idea about what could be causing this thanks
student,in screw the dealer does the dealer pick up the upcard
student,is there going to be a long instructorled review session over the weekend like there was in past terms
student,for the 2nd test case with the card queen of diamonds what is this line checking for int i1 ibobhandsize i ignore that first ten spades assertplayerhascardinhandawesomespadeshand i bob since the previous line checks that there is a queen of diamonds in bobs hand i dont understand the purpose of this check
student,will there be a test case that checks how the function responds after the 24th card has been dealt thank you
student,i know that this is a vague question but does anyone have any tips on how they are able to successfully study for an exam such as this im planning on going to the 12 hour review session on saturday for as long as i can reviewing all lecture slides and doing practice exams does anyone do anything else or anything differently that is more effective are there specific examples in the book that i should look through to prepare as well also do you have to rsvp for this review session and has a location for it been determined
student,hello so on our cardisface function when i try to pass in a card i get a no suitable conversion from card to const card existsi know this means i am passing in the wrong parameter however i am a little confused on how to convert a regular card to pass it into the function
student,essentially we ignore the order up suit unless we want to make trump and then we change it to the correct value
student,do we implement screw the dealer in the maketrump function or is that later on
student,where do we need to modify stdout in gameint function what information we need to cout
student,will we be tested on g and related material to compiling things in linux
student,when i attempt to return the card variable for this function i am getting an error saying that i am actually returning card how would i go about returning the actual card itself
student,can we assume that packin will be available in the final submission autograder and be exactly the same as the packin file we currently have
student,for some reason my playermaketrump isnt compiling and i get a bunch of cannot convert errors g pedantic wall werror g playertestscpp playercpp cardcpp o playertest playercpp in function bool playermaketrumpconst player const card const player int suit playercpp3254 error cannot convert const card to const card for argument 1 to bool cardistrumpconst card suit playercpp3339 error cannot convert const card to const card for argument 1 to bool cardisfaceconst card playercpp3828 error cannot convert const suit to suit in assignment playercpp4742 error cannot convert suit to suit in assignment playercpp5256 error cannot convert const card to const card for argument 1 to suit cardgetsuitconst card suit playercpp5338 error cannot convert const card to const card for argument 1 to bool cardisfaceconst card playercpp5742 error cannot convert suit to suit in assignment i tried to do what i had done in the past to avoid these issues but for some reason its not working this time around can somebody explain what the issue is i am using playerptrhandindex and upcardsuit so i am not trying to access these values directly nor am i modifying any of the parameters except for orderupsuit
student,how do we find out how we did on the labs ive submitted every one so far but only three have been returned and i cant find a mention of a grade or feedback anywhere i have never been to a lab in person as i do not have a working laptop atm
student,i suppose it is better to figure out here than on the test itself can we use strcmp const char const char on the midterm
student,when writing my cpp files should i put the rmes for all of the functions above the function definitions or should those only be in the h files is it bad style to have them in the cpp files
student,is the leader for every trick within a hand the player of the eldest hand aka the person to the left of the dealer or does it change every trick as in real euchere
student,so the test cpps with 00 at the end are the test cases that we do completely on our own so we dont just add all of our own tests to the pre made testscpps
student,i had a question on the following passage of the spec during round one a player will order up if he has two or more trump face cards in his hand trump face cards are the right and left bowers and q k a of the trump suit which is the suit proposed by the up card in this case does the dealer consider the up card as in his hand when he evaluates whether to pick it up or does he only evaluate the current cards in his hand
student,in packcpp i am trying to implement packinit and in doing so i wanted to use my string2enum function i used in cardcpp so i copied over the necessary code but when i try to run packtests the assert0 in string2enum gets hit and exits the program which never happened in cardcpp its the exact same code i had before and im calling it the same way but now it is somehow reaching the end i can add more information i just really dont know why it isnt returning out of the for loop before it gets down there
student,i cannot find aud ns in the location abbreviation webpage what is the full name of this building and where is it thank you very much
student,do we need to write more test cases for packreset i feel that there is really one way of testing the function
student,how can we use assert for the cardprint function
student,so im slightly confused by playeraddcardthe issue im having is that you need to go through the empty array of cards in the players hand and make sure youre putting card c in an empty slot the only issue im having is that while looping through i cant seem to find a way to say if i in the array is an empty card its okay to put a card thereand then exit because i dont know how to initialize an empty card to compare it to sorry if this seems like a dumb question im probably approaching this wrong thanks
student,is the material from lecture on 218 about subclassestypes going to be on the midterm exam
student,for the last compare function i am setting suit of the led card to the suit of card a in order to find out if the a is the same suit as the led suit is that correct for example id call getsuit with led card and trump and set that equal to getsuit with a and trump as the arguments if this statement is equal to 1 it means card a is the led suit correct
student,should we be using compare functions in addanddiscard
student,for the test case for playerplaycard assertcardcomparecardplayed ninespades 0 it says that the player should play the nine of spades but our player never picked up the 9 of spades and instead plays the queen of spades i am not sure where i am going wrong we passed all the other test cases except this one
student,for the test cases do we have to add them where it says add your tests here i put my test cases with the ones given so i put all my packshuffle tests in the same place as the packshuffle tests we were given and so on
student,since playerinit has an argument called name and the array in the struct declaration is also called name how can we set name name or use a strcpy im using strcpy but i would have to call it with strcpyname name correct that cant be right though
student,eecshelp says there will be no more although im assuming that that was for last night is rico still holding office hours at 10 am in the basement of the ugli
student,what if clubs was trump and all you had were clubs on a turn when hearts was led what card should be played according to the playcard function
student,will we lose points if our test cases are not in separate functions in the testscpp files
student,i pass all tests in packtestscpp playertestscpp and cardtestscpp yet i lost points for cardtest00 and packtest00not sure whyi ran it in netbeans which gave me no errors and ran it in the caen linux which also gave me no errorshas any1 had similar problems
student,i finally got it to compile and to run but it only runs through the six spades cards upon further review of my cards by calling print packptr since calling cards does nothing within gdb it doesnt appear that the array has saved any of my previous cards and is just filled with a bunch of junk gdb print packptr 17 cards rank 74 suit 1428 rank 810 suit spades rank 760826203 suit 2240 rank 50 suit 2292 rank 780 suit spades rank 852421325 suit 3072 rank 66 suit 3140 rank 834 suit spades rank 944791496 suit 3976 rank 94 suit 4072 rank 884 suit spades rank 2972190020 suit 4956 rank 86 suit 5044 rank 932 suit 16 rank jack suit 236 rank four suit hearts rank 380 suit 5652 rank three suit clubs rank 6032 suit 1204 rank three suit diamonds rank 7236 suit 3724 rank three suit 4 rank 10960 suit 788 rank four suit 5 next 0x9800002de4 gdb print card 18 rank nine suit hearts gdb print cardsi no symbol cards in current context i consider this progress from where i was in the first few iterations because after implementing the first card nine of spades the array had similar gibberish except that every card was of suit spades ie no random numbers in suit i really dont know why the array has any values including numbers in it and i definitely dont know why its not storing anything
student,i dont understand how to discard cards from the cards array within the player struct because you cant resize an array would it be efficient to change the cards value within the array to null when discarding it or does a new array with one fewer element need to be created and placed where the old cards array was or does a new discard function need to be created to deal with this any help or advice would be appreciated
student,on the autograder some of my tests pass while others say failed to compile how can my code compile for some tests and not for others note that its also only the tests with the 00 suffix that fail
student,willl our style be graded for the check point and are we required to comment
student,so say alice has the following cards jack of spades jack of clubs and clubs were led and spades are trump would alice play the jack of spades instead of the jack of clubs
student,are we allowed to access the private members of card outside of cardcpp for example can i write something like card card initialize card suit suit cardsuit in playercpp
student,so i am testing my playercpp file and it compiles and everything and when i execute it from the command line the assert statement is thrown at line 92 of playertestscpp which is this assertplayerhascardinhandqueenspades bob ensure he picked it up and the terminal output is this playertests playertestscpp92 int main assertion playerhascardinhandqueenspades bob failed aborted core dumped however when i went to inspect what was happening with gdb i put a breakpoint on line 88 just before the assert so i can get acquainted with whats happening around that area i load it in with the classic gdb tui playertests and then typed b 88 and then run so it will break at that line however gdb tells me program received signal sigabrt aborted 0x00007ffff7746cc9 in giraise sigsigentry6 at nptlsysdepsunixsysvlinuxraisec56 which seems like something goes wrong before line 92 in case the 56 in the output corresponds to a line in my code my playercpp file has a return true statement on that line is there something im missing
student,can we assume that an initialized pack has a deck of 24 cards thanks
student,so i am having a little trouble determining the potential scope of these impossible face melting test cases that will occur at the project finale my biggest confusion is where the scope of the requires clause ends and where the domain of the testing region beings does a requires clause mean that anything listed in the r clause are the only possible inputs and we should be testing for some sort of wizardry that sneaks other thing in essentially anything that doesnt fit the top specification or is the requires clause more of a guideline that says hey friend this is what we are expecting but honestly it could be anything it could even be a boat good luck
student,should playeraddanddiscard be called within playermaketrump since when a player makes something trump on the first round the dealer is forced to pick up the upcard or are these functions supposed to be called separately in the driver portion of our code later on
student,is the correct way to deal with an error such as say playermaketrump is called on a player that doesnt have any cards an assert im just confused because in the spec it tells us how to disable the assert statements but how will the autograder grade us will it expect us to assert out of the program if something like the above is called
student,for our player testcpp our playeraddanddiscard function passes up to the point where bob picks up the queen of spades since its higher however it does not pass the next assert line with the for loop line 95 we cant figure out the problem since we know that he has the queen of spades in his hand thanks
student,when you deal the last card in a deck should there be something to prevent it from being called again the rme does require that cards are in the deck but i was wondering
student,hey i use a mac and im trying to compile my files using xcode however i receive this error warning no rule to process file usersrichardchengoogle drive2014 fall termeecs 183cs aproject3makefile of type sourcecodemake for architecture x8664 im not sure what this means and im very unfamiliar with coding with caen basically only use it to compile a few times before i submit thanks in advance
student,do we need to add test cases to packtestscpp in order to pass packtest00 on the autograder i pass the public test cases in packtestscpp when i run make packtests and then packtests but i fail packtests00 when i submit to the autograder
student,getting a really strange output when using cout playerptrname any ideas what this represents our code stopped working after coding playerleadcard but the test file fails in line 33 before the function is ever called which is strange
student,so i ran through it a few times but am i correct in understanding that this shuffle function moves the first 3 cards to the end of the deck with all cards still in order except for 3 23 0 2 did i do something wrong here because there is no input to the amount of shuffling and the specs say to do this the 016 1723 swap 3 times and this seems a bit easy
student,has anybody had this issue in packinit my isopen always returns false even though ive copied the same code from lecture on fstreams my packin file is still named packin and its in the same directory as my executable im also using emacs not xcode
student,i have two completely separate issues with packcpp but for some reason each pops with when the other doesnt so i comment out my next declaration line to test the rest of the code i get an error that states undefined reference to main when i keep that line in my code i get cannot convert card24 to card a what is the relationship between these errors b any advice on fixing
student,i am trying to save each next card being read into a card variable however i am having trouble accessing the cards array how can i go about doing this
student,for playerinit if the rme says we need to initialize player with the c string name given as an argument and the hand with an empty hand does this mean we need to update the name array with the name passed in and then update the hand array to be an empty array
student,professor deorio said in lecture today that the autograder for the midpoint checkpoint would only be testing the public test cases i pass all the public test cases provided in packtestscpp however i just submitted to the autograder and failed packtests00 so does the autogravder actually perform more tests than those in the public test cases thanks
student,can we use include cmath for playercpp
student,the one unit test for playerleadcard has the comment card playerleadcard unit tests bob has the right bower the max which he should play if spades is led isnt that more of a description of playerplaycard since in this stage of the game nothing has been led yet
student,when we couted the rank in cardinit we got a number for example 7 instead of the rank for example nine is this just a property of enums when you cout a enum it will give you the number instead of the enum we got a number instead of the enum even though we static casted the i to be a rank
student,i am getting an error message from the autograder saying that only packtest00 wont compile is there any reason code would compile for all the other test cases but fail to compile for one in particular shouldnt compiling of my code happen before an individual test case is applied to it
student,does the order the cards are in the players hand matter can i swap them around if it is helpful for certain methods
student,ive been roaming piazza and i have seen lots of people having similar but not quite the same issue i have my compiler spits out the following bash41 g packcpp packh o pack packcpp in function u2018void packinitpack const charu2019 packcpp40 error no matching function for call to u2018stdbasicifstreamchar stdchartraitschar openstdstringu2019 usrlibgccx8664redhatlinux447includec447fstream525 note candidates are void stdbasicifstreamchart traitsopenconst char stdiosbaseopenmode with chart char traits stdchartraitschar packcpp54 error no matching function for call to u2018cardinitcard const char const charu2019 cardh46 note candidates are void cardinitcard rank suit cardh53 note void cardinitcard const char const char packcpp55 error cannot convert u2018cardu2019 to u2018cardu2019 in assignment packcpp58 error u2018cardsu2019 was not declared in this scope ive checked that my strings are c string pointers before putting them in the function and when i do that for the first error in bold it would change to be cardinitcard const char const char ive been doing lots of searching and cant figure it out any ideas
student,wont screw the dealer be impossible to reach if you have 5 face cards and only need one to call it up wont at least someoneincluding the dealer have one so then writing specific code for this would be redundant
student,i feels like it would be really helpful if we can get the pre and post lab answers please give us the post and pre lab answers
student,i have a question about function override in the lecture our professor said when a derived class object call a member function the derived version if there is one member function will run rather than the based version but what if there is another class derives from the first derived class like the equilateral class what if this class does not override any functions and call a member function will it call the original based version say triangle or call a derived version say isosceles also our textbook talks about the virtual and override keywords will we dive into these keywords later what are the differences between using them and not thanks
student,do we have an unlimited amount of autograder submissions for the checkpoint
student,what is wrong with my initializer list here i cant figure it out it seems like i followed the example from lecture 10 projectileprojectilepoint2d pos double xvel double yvel posxposx posyposy xvelxvel yvelyvel
student,do we have to make test cases for the provided functions in cardcpp
student,in playertestscpp it tries to test the function playerhascardinhand but there is no such function in playerh
student,
student,we submitted our project to the autograder and it also compiles fine on a g compiler on terminal however on the the autograder we get test case playertest00 failed to compile we read that it was a problem with the libraries here are the libraries we included is there any other reason or library that could cause this problem include playerh include string include cstdlib include cassert include cstdio include iostream
student,ive read through all the similar packinit questions on piazza but im still having trouble understanding how to tackle this function so far ive successfully read in the packin file declared three string variables and set up a while loop to read in each line in the text file i know i need to use cardinit somewhere in my while loop to initialize each card but i cant figure out how to go about it any hints suggestions thanks in advance
student,when i submit to the auto grader i currently get 56 the only case i miss a point on is playertest00 where it says playertest00 01 it doesnt have the compile error is there more test cases than in the payertestscpp file when i run that i pass all of the cases it started with i thought maybe i had messed it or playerh up while debugging so i removed them from my project 3 directory redownloaded new copies of the original code and put them in my project 3 directory my playertestcpp still compiles fine and playertests still gets throgh without triggering any assert statements what could be the reason when i submit it to the auto grader that it fails some case thanks
student,the assert statement in playertests assert strcmpalicename alice 0 passes for my code sometimes but not other times why is it inconsistent
student,im assuming it will be until todays on subclasses also is the final exam cumulative
student,hi are we supposed to modify the dealers hand in this function if so how am i supposed to deal with this since dealer is a const i know we cant make copies that are nonconst soooooo
student,in spec it says that if the trump suit is ordered up during round one the dealer receives it he then discards the lowest card among his hand and takes the turnup so is that mean we have to call adddiscard in playermaketrump function to discard add new card to dealer
student,i went through both practice tests but i still dont really feel like i got enough practice are there any other tests or practice questions we could use
student,ive learned that if making reaches the dealer during the second round screw the dealer happens where the dealer is forced to order up then should playermaketrump return true since it did order up dealer did not player or should it return false since player didnt want to order up but it had to be order up because dealer is forced to
student,what does it mean to check the command line arguments for euchrecpp should we make sure that pack can be opened even though this is done in packinit should we check to make sure that the 3rd argument is either shuffle or no shuffle and nothing else should the number of players be even thanks
student,what is the expected result for packdealone if the next pointer is pointed to the last card in the pack is it ok that the pointer go out of the boundary of the array and we make sure not to dereference it in the game or should the pointer stay in the pack if it is the case are we dealing cards from the index 0 or index 23
student,for some reason i do not have packtests in my directory i have the cpp file but i have no way of testing it when i run packtests i get a message saying i have no such file in my directory is anybody else having a similar issue i can open playertests and cardtests
student,for the add and discard card i have two questions 1 is the card sorted or do we need to sort the card 2 for the card index 04 if index 2 is the lowest card do we need to replace the upcard to the index 2 or we can put the upcard to random position within index 04
student,so far i have made playerinit and playeraddcard in my playercpp function im trying to test them i didnt even include the other functions but when i try to do make player tests i get this error message usrlibgccx8664redhatlinux447lib64crt1o in function start text0x20 undefined reference to main im not referring to main in any functions that i wrote also i dont know what start refers to i cmdshiftfd it but it came up nowhere in my code plz help
student,so for player add and discard the rme says that its supposed to add and discard a card from the hand because of the situation of ordering up the only person who can pick up a card is the dealer but in the spec it talks about if a player has more than 2 face cards he has the dealer pick up the card we are talking about 2 people given this who is the player in playerptr argument i am so confused as to how you are supposed to check the cards of a given player but then have a secondary player pick updiscard a card instead of the player whose cards you are checking or please correct me if im wrong thank you so much
student,in this function the spec says to play the highest card of led suit if the player has it and if he doesnt to play the lowest card in his hand how does the trump suit come into play here
student,in the specs it says that he then discards the lowest card among his hand and the turnup for a final total of five cards i thought you pick up the turnup in the first round and discard only the lowest card
student,when writing pack tests i defined a couple of my own pack files to use in testing running the make checkpointtar command does not include these files so it results in an error when packtestscpp is run to solve this problem i created my own tar file that includes all the files requested by make checkpointtar as well as the two pack input files that i wrote will submitting extra input files be a problem for the autograder
student,the tree we are drawing is balanced and not sorted correct i think i am misunderstanding pre and post traversal for the following tree 4 2 6 1 3 5 7 and to my knowledge pre and post would traverse in this order pre 4213657 post 1234567

student,or will this never happen
student,what do we do with cards once they are discarded does the order they are discarded in become the new order for the pack
student,i have a question regarding what exactly rank and suit are for example name of playerptrname is a char array rank and suit however dont give a spec regarding with types they consist of are rank and suit also just char arrays
student,is the gsi here for the ugli office hours from 1210140
student,for some reason i keep getting a compile error that exitexitfailure is not defined in the scope should the code be exitexitfailure or should i be including a file at the top that im currently not including i have packh right now
student,ik they give guidelines on splitting the pack from 016 then 1723 but im having trouble trying to do just exactly thatcan any1 give me any hints on how to approach this
student,what time will vidals exam review be on saturday
student,hi i was trying to find the ide guide in the quick references in the drive but it wasnt there could somebody link me to it please
student,so if cards arent in order how do we make sure that we discard a card from a players hand in way that will be okay and wont affect hands in card reading in the future is there a certain type we name it or rank we give it
student,hey guys is there an error in the cardgetsuitconst card cardptr suit trump function that is given to us it returns the trump suit when the card pointed to is the left bower it seems to me that it should do this only if the card is the right bower thanks
student,im mainly having trouble with initializing the second card in a persons deck using my debugger on netbeans i know that i successfully set packptrcards with a suit and a rank then before i go onto the next card in packin i do packptrnext so i can get to the next card but when i try to assign a suit to packptrnext netbeans says i have a segfaultwhy is that
student,when i download my p3 files on caen through google drive i am able to make packtests and the such but when i try to run them i get the message permission denied the files are all in my users folder any ideas on what could be causing this thanks
student,for example given that trump is spade we do cardcomparejack of heart king of club which one is higher
student,i have a question for making test cases do we need to test things that will never happen for example for playermaketrump it is not required that the playerptr has any cards in his hand but it would never happen that this function would be called with a pointer that doesnt have any cards so do we need to test it additionally if we did what would we do if the player didnt have any cards could someone please answer this with a general answer not necessarily just specifically for what i wrote above but like what all should we be testing as in what types of situations thanks
student,so ive been trying to understand how void playeradddiscardconst player playerptr const card upcard is supposed to modify playerptr if playerptr is const i cant figure out how this is supposed to be accomplished since you also cant give a const player type to a function that takes regular player type how do i modify playerptr
student,when i type in make checkpointtar in terminal it says no rule to make target checkpointtar stop how can i make the file to submit to the autograder im typing it in while i am in my project 3 folder
student,on task two in lab 6 the spec says to use an initializer list to initialize all of the variables what exactly are we suppose to initialize them to are we supposed to set them to arguments passed to the function or 0
student,should we modify the base int cardcompareconst card a const card b that the starters file gives us it doesnt make sense currently that one card is greater than another based on suit when neither one is trump or the suit of a led card
student,
student,suppose player has 9s 10s qs 9c 10c the function addanddiscard is called with 9h as the upcard would the player discard 9s or 9c since it is a tie
student,is there a place where you can look for the details of your autograder score details
student,in the spec this line confuses me if a player can follow suit he plays the highest card that follows suit otherwise he plays the lowest card in his hand for the lowest card piece should we or should we not consider trump
student,from the hand grading section what does loc and rem mean
student,the spec says that the main function in euchrecpp should read the command line arguments check them for errors and then print them what exactly does it mean by check them for errors
student,so using the playertestcpp situation bob has ten spades king spades ace spades jack clubs jack spades right now and we do playeraddanddiscardbob ninespades his lowest card is ten spades so hes supposed to replace ten spades with nine spades is this correct
student,for this function im having trouble checking if a player has a card of the same color as the upcard i know that were supposed to use the suitnext function but im not sure how i can check the suit of each card in a players hand can someone help me out here
student,lets pretend that i am paranoid and that i would like to get all possible test cases right including ones that cant actually happen in real life would it be reasonable to make sure our cardcompare function can handle cardcompare ninespades ninespades ninespades spades
student,for the card compare function do we have to compare all of the cards ie two through ace or only the nine through ace that we need for euchre
student,in packtestscpp i had to change the name of the input file from packin to packintxt for the filestream to recognize and read from the file should this generate any problems down the road
student,is it normal that in order for my code to compile i must call cardinit in packinit as follows cardinitpackptrnext otherwise i get a compiler error saying the function does not match a simple packptrnext yields the following message no matching function for call to ‘cardinitcard const char const char
student,im working on playeraddcard function and have problem assigning card to cardinit because its parameter is card cardptr const char rank const char suit so i have to put non const card but the parameter of playeraddcard is const card so i get this no argument match error i am wondering if i have to convert const card to nonconst card
student,i keep getting this error in packcpp can anyone clue me in as to what i might be doing wrong here packcpp in function ‘void packinitpack const char’ packcpp40 error no match for ‘operator’ in ‘readpack rank’ usrlibgccx8664redhatlinux447includec447istream119 note candidates are stdbasicistreamchart traits stdbasicistreamchart traitsoperatorstdbasicistreamchart traits stdbasicistreamchart traits with chart char traits stdchartraitschar
student,in the case that the leading card is the same suit as the trump in playerplaycard if the player holds the left bower would the left bower follow suit of the leading card
student,i used suitname rankname in playercpp and it gives me identifier suitnames is undefined does anyone know why
student,what is the difference between a class and struct
student,confused on what exactly that arguments are pointing to void packinitpack packptr const char packfilename i understand we need to read in the strings from packin but what is the role of the arguments and why are they pointers thanks
student,if the upcard is a jack of diamonds and in the dealer has a jack of hearts and a 10 of diamonds would the dealer make it trump this would yield 2 trump face cards in his hand when he picked it up or are we just simplifying it to say that it doesnt matter on the person they would need to have 2 trump face cards in their hand before they picked it up
student,is there any way for us to check and see why we may have had points taken off for the hand grading part of project 2
student,say the upcard was hearts if a player has one or more diamond face cards theyll order up diamond but if all the players pass and we reach the screw the dealer scenario the dealer is forced to order up diamonds so basically regardless of any players hands in this scenario we will always order up diamonds during the second round is this the correct interpretation
student,i lost some point in project 2 since it is said by the email that i fail to use tail recursive in most of my list functions i have used labster to check the list functions and i think at least most of them directly call helper functions with tail recursive but i was told that they are not tail recursive by the email i wonder if the function is served as tail recursive in this case i think it should be but i am not sure in fact it makes me worry about my midterm
student,since pack contains an array of cards and a pointer to a card next is it valid to refer to next as packptrnext in the same way that you would refer to a card like packptrcardsi
student,i implemented the three functions that are needed to be implemented in cardcpp but now i get two unusual errors when i try to run it each is repeated several times in the terminal the first error reads as follows and occurs in both required implementations of cardcompare error cannot convert const card to const card for argument 1 to function called im not sure what this means because i am using the arguments given for each implementation of cardcompare and calling functions that were already implemented in the source code the second error is listed at the end of the output message and appears to occur at the end of every function including the new function a string2enum template i added within cardcpp error control reaches end of nonvoid function werrorreturntype im not sure what this means either since i have returns in every branch and have ended each function with an assert0 so at no point can the function reach the end without returning something edit the same error appears if i remove the assert0 from every function could somebody explain what my second error means and how i can get around the first error without changing the headerfile or source codeimplemented functions
student,im a bit confused about why i lost points for some of my functions for not being tail recursion i was under the impression that tail recursive functions when theyre calling themselves again have no arithmetic to do ie return functionnamelistrestlist randomvariable would appreciate any further clarification on the difference between tail recursion and recursion
student,currently im working on playercpp and im wondering this because of cardinits parameters void cardinitcard cardptr const char rank const char suit so i have to have const chars and i could only access to enums index by doing cardrank and cardsuit i guess in order to use cardinit i have to have chars like spade jack in parameter then it means i have to convert enum to string like below do i have to really do this enum ostype linux apple windows inline const char tostringostype v switch v case linux return linux case apple return apple case windows return windows default return unknown ostype
student,in the project specs for making trump for round one it specifically says a player will order up if he has two or more trump face cards in his hand then for round two it says a player will order up the suit with the same color as the up card if he has one or more face cards of that suit in his hand does that mean that the left bower is not considered in round 2 like it is in round 1 example the up card is the a nine of diamonds a player has a jack of diamonds and the rest of the hand is all clubs everyone passes round one and the player is the beginning of round two does the player order up hearts in round two is the jack of diamonds considered a heart
student,will checkpoint be graded for style will implementation files be graded for style will test cases files be graded for style i know we are not allowed to see the style rubric but what is the general rule of style for project 3 thanks
student,can someone clarify this statement in the spec if the trump suit is ordered up during round one the dealer receives it he then discards the lowest card among his hand and the turn­up does this mean he takes the turn up card and then discards the lowest card at the end of the sentence it sounds like its saying to discard the lowest card and the turnup also can the person take the turn up and then put it back down
student,1 if we pass the autograder for checkpoint does it mean we will get full point for the checkpoint 2 do we have to add more test case for the checkpoint in testing files 3 for the final test file do we have to consider the case where there are identical cards
student,im trying to add card to players hand and i am getting converterror on cardinit because i am trying to assign const pointer to nonconst pointer does anyone know how to fix this error it says argument does not match
student,this is kind of strange and embarrassing but i cant get my file stream to work for some reason because of the compiler error given in the title of the post has anybody else encountered this more to the point does anybody know how to fix it thanks
student,hello i was wondering if it is okay to use packreset in the packinit function thank you
student,were just getting around to testing our first complete function but were getting all these unresolved external symbol errors which i know to mean that there was a function called that was declared but not implemented which is incredibly annoying because weve definitely implemented those functions heres an example error 6 error lnk2019 unresolved external symbol bool cdecl cardisfacestruct card const cardisfaceyanpbucardz referenced in function main cusersmedocumentsclass stuffeecs 280project320150216project3p3p3cardtestsobj p3 its giving this for pretty much every cardbased function do you guys know whats up thanks a lot
student,my playerinit function works perfectly unless the name of the player is 1 character in that case the function fails does anyone know why this is the case
student,if this has already been answered i apologize during round 2 a player will order up up a suit with the same color as the up card if he has one or more face cards of that suit in his hand so lets say the up card is a 9 of diamonds in my hand are three black cards a king of diamonds and a king of hearts what color would i then order up
student,as i have been testing my cardinit functions i have only been able to output the integer value of the enumerated types is this normal or is there a way to output a literal value such as two
student,in our test cases should we keep the provided test cases or should we delete those and then only have our own in the file
student,is there a way to get a nonconst card out of a player pointer declared constant without using something like constcast
student,can we compare the pointers of them does it mean that the dealer will point to one of the players or do we create a new player and copy the info from one of the players
student,when the player plays the lowest card in his hand does he consider trump should we prevent the player from reneging
student,
student,can we use cstr to convert the c strings we get from the file into cstrings this would make it easier to pass into our cardinit function thanks
student,we are trying to cast the characters for rank and suit into enums using the template in lecture 8 but it is not being stored in a variable so the compiler still reads rank and suit as chars how can we fix this issue
student,can we cin to strings and convert those strings to char arrays using a for loop the spec is unclear regarding when exactly we can use c strings
student,in round 2 of making trump people might name a suit other than the suit of the up card it doesnt mention the criteriacondition whether to pass or name a suit i am confused about it does the strategy depend on ourselves understanding about when a person might name a suit
student,hello everybody i dont understand how to use packptr in the packinit function it would seem to me that using the extraction operator or getline would do what i need to do for the function so im not really sure what pactptr is for could somebody please clarify this for me thanks in advance
student,maybe i just need a quick eof refresh but when using make euchre in terminal with the makefile i get the error that my cpps dont have end of files but a google search has only told me to change the compiler argument but i dont want to change the makefile suggestions
student,my cardinit works correctly my packinit works the way it should except that i have a line in my while loop that just does cardinitcard rank suit but i cant seem to apply that value to each card every time it iterates through the loop i thought the packptr next packptr cards was going to do this but instead i dont actually assign the cardinit value to a card i am simply just reading in from the file converting that to a card rank and suit and then doing nothing with it apparently any help on how to fix this would be appreciated
student,lets say for example jack has 2 cards in his hands 9 of clubs 9 of spades and the lead card is of the suit diamonds which card should jack play since 9 of clubs and 9 of spades are of equal does it matter
student,im really having trouble understanding what this line of code means this can be found in packtestscpp card firstcard packnext how does the above line tie in with the following code struct pack card cardspacksize card next next card to be dealt
student,im having some trouble implementing the name section of playerinit ive created a new nonconst char to hold the copied version of the given version of name but i keep getting pointer conversion errors could someone lend a little help
student,so when i compile my packcpp in xcode it gives me an excbadexcess error but when i use terminal to compile and run my code it gives me error opening packin i dont understand why terminal is giving me this error im using the basic test cases already provided for me
student,1 do we have to initialize the playerptrhand isnt playerptrhandsize 0 enough 2 for playeraddcard can i just set playerptrhand c how should i do it can someone help me with this
student,i have a point in my code where creating a new struct would make the process much simpler are we allowed to create new structs or do we just have to use the ones already made
student,why does it say playertests is up to date when i type in make playertests however when i type in g pedantic wall werror o1 playertestscpp playercpp cardcpp o playertests it works as shown below why thanks
student,a statement in the rme for this function is unclear to me if player wishes to order up a trump suit then return true and change orderupsuit to desired suit this function returns a bool only so i dont understand what change orderupsuit to desired suit means exactly
student,im trying to compile my packcpp in terminal but im getting this error message i looked it up but couldnt find a solution can someone help me out here
student,for the first cardcompare function that was already written for us i dont understand how the function returns an int for example if you have asuit aranksuitsize wouldnt asuit just give you something like hearts or spades not an actual number that can be added to another value
student,does empty hand in playerinit only means the hand size should be initialized to be 0 is there anything that has to be done with the cards eg initialize them to certain values
student,where can i find recorded lectures for all the professors right now i am only seeing one professor
student,assuming the right bower is jack of diamonds the order should go clubs hearts spades right bowerjack of diamonds left bowerjack of hearts akq109 diamonds a k j not including the bowers 10 9 does that look right
student,what does this mean the first paragraph is this a message that everyone gets or is there confusing things in our code that prompted it please take a moment to verify that the contents of the attached submission archive are what you intended to submit you can extract the archive with the following command mkdir p tmp tar c tmp xzvf submissiontargz this will create a directory called tmp and extract the archive into that directory test case results packtests 11 test case packtest00 failed to compile packtest00 01 playertests 11 test case playertest00 failed to compile playertest00 01 cardtest00 11 cardtests 11 total score 46 also is there a specific reason that some of our test files would fail to compile ie specific libraries were supposed to include
student,the first cardcompare says it does not consider trump does this mean it doesnt consider the suit rankings at all or just that it doesnt matter which suit is trump so diamonds is always the highest suit for instance if i have a 6diamonds and a 6spades should they return equal or do i still consider diamonds above spades
student,ive been writing my own test cases in cardtest but ive been writing them right below the given test cases for each function i just noticed that there is a space at the bottom for implementing our own test cases is it a big deal if my personal test cases are mixed in with the instructorprovided test cases also does it matter if i adjusted instructorprovided test cases slightly i declaredinitialized some cards in the early functions that were declared and inititalized in later functions so i deleted the later declarationinitialization
student,are we assuming that the first card the player get goes to the position hand0 and the second goes to hand1etc
student,when i try to compile my packcpp in terminal i get the following error how can i fix this
student,for playerinit i used strcpy to deal with assigning a const variable to non const variable i was implementing playeraddone and ran into the same problem however i dont know how to deal with assigning a const to non const since there is not function for that because we are dealing with type card now could someone please help thanks
student,does it make sense for the add and discard function to just find the card you want to discard and replace it with the card youre adding or do we somehow still want the card in the array and thus try to shift it to a place in the card array that wont be reached because of the limit of hand size
student,do we need to call adddiscard in playermaketrump or does the latter just simply returns truefalse and we will add the card to the dealer somewhere else
student,with the altered euchre rules that this project is based on shouldnt the suit of the card led no matter what makes this cardcompare function different from the previous one
student,im having a difficult time trying to execute the shuffle function since our only way to initialize a deck is to take in the order from a text document im not sure how to change the actual cards in this deck i kept trying to use cardinit but it keeps spitting back the original deck order is there somewhere i should be passing packptr by reference
student,i get an error at playerhascardinhand function so i ran debugger and see the values in the playerptrhand the first hand says jack spade which is wrong but has name but the rest hands have weird memory values does anyone know whats happening is the memory value correct value for the rest of cardsamazingspade thing weird thing is that when i cardprint the playerptrhand i get right output
student,do we need to consider cases where twos threes or other invalid euchre cards can be passed in if these are passed in should we include an exit clause
student,in eecs280 is break considered a bad style
student,packdealones effects clause says that it returns the next card in the pack and increments the next pointer does that mean we shouldnt worry if the next pointer points to somewhere completely irrelevant
student,i was looking over the recommended reading for lecture 8 and i was wondering how the the whole argcargv bit works if we have the main program in an executable named prog and we pass prog d o ofile data0 1 does the compiler assign argc the number 5 and then use that to know how big argv is supposed to be also main can be alternatively defined as int main int argc char argv 2 so is argv essentially a sequence of pointers to pointers that point the elements provided on the command line in order if so why the need for middle man pointer
student,when coding this function how do we know if player wants to pass or order up
student,i am running packtests for the packinit function and everything is compiling correctly except im getting the error cards was not declared in this scope basically im trying to get to the array of cards within the pack struct by packptrcards but it is not letting me because the compiler does not know what cards is cards is the name of the array when the struct is declared so im not sure why im getting this error any ideas
student,im having trouble with the handsize value getting modified on the last call to addcard on the example test case it increments fine every other time but the last one and for some reason me assigning a new value to playerptrhand doubles handsize anyone have any idea why this is happening if i need to make this private and post my code i can do that as well
student,if an ace of spades was led and the trump is clubs and i only have a nine of spades and a nine of diamonds in my hand which one should i play in real life i would obviously play the nine of diamonds because it would beat the ace but what are the rules for playing trump when you can follow suit
student,for the first compare function the given tests are as stated assertcardcompareacediamonds acehearts 0 assertcardcompareacehearts acediamonds 0 however shouldnt the first test result in 0 and the second one result in 0
student,i wrote the code for reading in the packin file in a similar format to that on the lecture slides when i run the test case with packinitpack packin i get the error message i implemented when my file does not open error opening packin when i change the test case to the full path to packin it works fine and passes packinitpack p3packin what do i need to do to fix this will it pass the autograder tests as is
student,do we need to have our own test cases done for the checkpoint or do our files just need to pass the given test cases
student,are we supposed to print out the output arguments ie euchre 10 shuffle etc even if the input arguments are incorrect before printing out the error message saying usage must be in this format
student,if the led card is also the left bower does the led suit then become the same as the trump suit for example if the trump suit is clubs and the led card is the jack of spades is the led suit now clubs
student,are the published test cases the tests on the autograder so if our code passes all the tests on the checkpoint autograder does that mean well pass the midproject checkpoint with full credit thanks in advance
student,in the spec it says when a player leads a trick he plays the highest non­trump card in his hand however in the test for playerleadcard it says that the returned card should be the jack of spades when passed bobs hand and spades as the trump suit if bob has the queen of spades king of spades ace of spades jack of clubs and jack of spades shouldnt the returned card be the jack of clubs since thats the highest non trump card in his hand thanks
student,what will the dealer choose to order up
student,i dont really get what to do with our own test cases where do you want us to make them for cardcpp would we make the test cases in cardtestscpp also wouldnt it just going to be copypaste of already written test cases but with different values
student,in the first description on the spec for making trump it says if a player orders up during round one that the dealer takes the card and discards one of the five that are already in his hand should the function playermaketrump include the dealer picking up the card or should it happen outside the function
student,im confused of what this function is supposed to do the effects say the detail is in the spec where is it based of my understanding the only time that a player needs to add a new card is when the player is the dealer why use this function at all is this whole function just for the dealer
student,what is the type of playerptr hand
student,i had a question about pointers its related to project 2 but its also a general question for example were given the function void cardinitcard cardptr const char rank const char suit cardptr is a pointer that points to a card object does const char rank point to a character array what is the difference between const char rank and const char rank
student,the spec says if a player can follow suit he plays the highest card that follows suit does following suit include include matching the suit of the leading card or the trump card
student,can we set the value the function returns for example if a b can we just set return 1 to get positive result also can we create our own functions to convert char to rank and suit for cardinit
student,i am confused on why orderupsuit is passed through in this function is orderupsuit always the same as upcard can someone please explain the spec for playermaketrump a bit more thanks
student,if one says order up in round 1 then do we need to add the card to dealer in making trump or do it later in other functions and there is one thing confuses me is the up card in round 2 the same as the up card in round 1 if it is and if no one gets the up card in round 2 why does it matter if one wants to order up or not based on the up card last thing i just want to double check no one will get a new card in round 2 right
student,i am testing packinit and when the test case asserts that the first card in the deck is the same as the nine of spades it fails i looked in the debugger and it is claiming that the first card is a two of spades clearly that cant be possible because 9 is the lowest card in the game i am trying to test this using the packin file that was provided anyone have any insight as to what the problem could be thanks
student,when my partner and i submit to the autograder we get a response that says we failed packtest00 because it failed to compile it was our understanding that we only need to pass the published test cases for the checkpoint deadline and when running the makefile commands it appeared as though we had were just curious as to where this packtest00 test case is coming from any input would be appreciated thanks in advance
student,when i run packtests i get an error for card ninespades nine spades card firstcard packnext assertcardcomparefirstcard ninespades 0 however when i change card firstcard packnext to card firstcard packcards it works for me i am also able to pass the second passinit test does anyone have any ideas of why this isnt working
student,i implemented my packinit function and the terminal is giving me this error message i cant quite figure out why my parameter is a reference instead of a pointer could some please guide me in the right direction thanks packcpp in function ‘void packinitpack const char’ packcpp26 error no matching function for call to ‘cardinitcard const char const char’ cardh46 note candidates are void cardinitcard rank suit cardh53 note void cardinitcard const char const char
student,the spec says during round two a player will order up the suit with the same color as the up card if he has one or more face cards of that suit in his hand lets say 9 hearts was the up card and a player has jack of diamonds and everything else is black in round 2 are we considering the jack of diamonds to be a diamond or a heart because we usually consider the left bowers suit to be the trump suit hearts and not diamonds would this player call trump for round 2 or pass
student,in the card compare function we are supposed to return a zero if the cards are of equal value for instance a queen of hearts and a queen of diamonds if the trump and led suit were spades these two values would register as equal however we have added the notion that the cards are ordered by suit as well and therefore the queen of diamonds is of higher value than that of the queen of hearts does this mean the function should never return a zero
student,i have a little bit of trouble understanding a parameter i know that upcard is the upcard but what is the upsuit paramater i know we are modify it when a player wishes to order up a trump but whats the actual parameter when its being passed in
student,when i look at packintxt there are no whitespaces between the cards nine of spadesten of spadesjack of spadesqueen of spadesking of spadesace of spades and i just noticed that when i copied that line into this post they were automatically put into different lines nine of spades ten of spades jack of spades queen of spades king of spades ace of spades are they in different lines and my text file is weird or are we supposed to do some weird traversal to find when the next card is stated in the text file
student,this may be a silly question but during making before anyone orders up a trump suit do all players including the dealer always have five cards in their hand at this stage of the round
student,if we are discarding from a full pack blow nines and only rank the cards above nine why do we need two eight in card
student,2 general questions about these 1 are we supposed to be removing the asserts in the cpp file when testing mine doesnt work when the assert0 is at the bottom of the function but when i comment it out it passes the test casedoes this mean my function is working or it has to work with the assert 0 in it 2 are we allowed to use functions already given within the functions we have to write ie for our card compare not even sure if this would be useful or not but is it allowed to use the card comapre function already written within the one that we have to write thanks
student,there is a packnext function that is in the packtestscpp after calling the shuffle function i wrote i printed all of the cards and it shuffles correctly but it does not pass the test after looking into this the packnext is referencing the third card in the array instead of the first as labeled firstcard im confused on what packnext actually does and why it wouldnt reference the first spot in the card array
student,when were playing a card in the last two functions of playercpp how do we remove it from the array is there a specific way that were supposed to do so do we just set that index of the card array in the struct to an empty card and if so how do we do that
student,in the void playeraddanddiscardplayer playerptr const card upcard function int numlowest is the index of the lowest rank card i want to replace the lowest rank card with the upcard im confused in the replacement why playerptrhandnumlowest upcard is correct but playerptrhand numlowest upcard is wrong assign pointer to pointer causes an error lvalue requeired as left operand of assignment
student,whats the difference between the two cardinits im really confused it seems cardtestcpp only tests one cardinit thanks
student,so they say that we divide the shuffle into 016 and 1723 how are we going to swap the member from 1723 are pushed to the first 7 member ie 06 while the previous 016 is 723 thanks
student,should our card compare test be able to compare identical cards say card a 9 of spades card b 9 of spades could this or should this be a test case that we need to pass
student,for the second compare function what purpose does the led card serve is it only the suit does it serve as a sort of second trump where any card in the trump is the highest then any card in the led suit then the aces in suit order then the kings in suit order thanks
student,so i know how to access a specific element of a pack of cards using array indexing packptrcardsi but in the interest of practicing and understanding pointers id be curious to know if there is an equivalent statement for the above one using array traversal if there is id appreciate if someone would also type out in english what that bit of code does as well thanks
student,im getting a segmentation fault 11 on this function void packinitpack packptr const char packfilename i have followed the class lecture 08argvioenumsandtemplatespdf p 15 and then just before the while loop i declare three variables in order to take in the three words per line on packin file so it looks like this string word1 string word2 string word3 basically right out of the lecture slides any idea why im getting a seg fault 11
student,hello are we only allowed to use the given packin for our test cases for packcpp are we not allowed to create our own packs to test cause its not a given file and the autograder wont like it thank you
student,i am trying to write a function which takes in a const packptr then in this function i try to traverse packptrcards by pointer however in the declaration of the loop variable i get the compiler errorcannot convert const card to card in initialization when i get rid of the const in the function prototype it compiles fine though are you not allowed to declare a struct const and then set a pointer to one of its fields
student,will our code have to deal with packin files of indefinite length or will every test case with packin only contain the 24 cards
student,why cant i use the name of the array for increment like packptrcards does this mean that i cannot use traverse by pointer for an array of structs
student,should we have a full set of personalized test cases in our testscpp files when turning them in for the checkpoint in other words for the checkpoint is it sufficient to have working implementations of the functions but unmodified test files
student,
student,so if jack of diamonds is card a jack of hearts is card b and clubs is both the led suit and trump suit which card wins thanks
student,for cardcompare that takes into account trump we should be assuming that if clubs is trump the jack of clubs and jack of spades are both greater than the ace of clubs correct thanks
student,i know in the spec it says we should use strcopy this is probably a stupid question but im unsure of where and why we would use it what is the purpose of copying a string thanks
student,the lecture on argv enums etc states that enums are stored in order and can be treated like numbersdoes that mean the things stored in the enum can be indexed like the first one is 0 the second one is 1 etc
student,undefined symbols for architecture x8664 cardcomparecard const card const referenced from main in packtestso cardinitcard char const char const referenced from packinitpack char const in packo ld symbols not found for architecture x8664 clang error linker command failed with exit code 1 use v to see invocation when i run packtest there is an error message described above i have included packh in packcpp i do not know how to fix it
student,if a player order up a suit in round 2 will the dealer take the up card and discards the lowest card or nothing will happen to the up card
student,to test my pack functions i wrote another txt file packintest1 like packin to test my code is that ok
student,i just finished implementing the first cardcompare function it is considerably long is that normal am i adding too much unnecessary code is this also true for the second cardcompare function thanks
student,what exactly is it i dont remember using it in project 1 can someone explain in detail what shell direction does and what it is
student,what is cardinit supposed to do
student,so i know that the code cardptrrank rank cardptrsuit suit doesnt work with cardinit because they arent of the same type but i dont know how im supposed to convert const char rank to an integer for me to manipulate like for example what integer value is suit cardptrsuit in relation to const char suit i just have no idea what this const char even means what its value is or how to convert it to an integer that i can use to make this above statement work
student,if the card is the last card in the pack how can we handle that can we still increment it
student,hello we were finishing the cardcpp functions today and we were wondering is the offsuit automatically considered trump in the code or do we have to account for this like say trump was diamondswe know jack of diamonds is trump but would the function automatically consider the jack of hearts as trump or would we need to account for this
student,where are office hours i am in the basement of the ugli right now not sure where they are
student,if im comparing a king of diamonds to a king of spades when clubs is trump and hearts was led what value should my function return
student,if none of the 4 cards is from the trump suit and two of them are both k while the other 2 are 9 which of the players who played k wins
student,when i tried to compile using the terminal i would get an error saying exit was not declared in the scope so i included this library and it worked include cstdlib is that fine or should i remove it
student,when im trying to implement cardinit im using a switch statement whose input is the cstring rank in the function input however i am getting the compiler error switch quantity not an integer any ideas
student,so to get full points for the checkpoint all we have to do is pass the test cases on the autograder for playercardpack cpps
student,hello i keep running into a strange problem in my findword method i have tested the strcmp method extensively and made sure that it returns 0 when both strings are the same however when i use strcmp in my function what ends up happening is that strcmp skips past the case and automatically assigns the return value to 1 this confuses me because ive already checked to make sure that matching cases return 0 ive checked whether im reading in the strings incorrectly and i am not either this is very frustrating and im not sure why this is consistently happening
student,for cardcpp the only functions we have to code are the ones that have implement me correct ie the second cardinit and the two cardcompares
student,can create a separate function and put our test cases in that function for our testcpp files
student,in the cardcpp there is a function overload cardcompare but in the third function definition where the led card is also passed in i couldnt figure out how a led card could affect the comparison
student,in project 3 a couple functions are written beforehandi wonder if we need to test those as well
student,any tips on discarding a card from your hand having a hard time with this thanks
student,will we need to write all of our comments for the files we submit on the 19th by that point or will the comments just need to be there for our final submission
student,so i am working on the findword function in lab5 and it works fine the first time i enter a word but when main asks me to enter a second word my program seg faults every time i used cout statements to locate the segfault and it looks like the segfault is in the conditional statement of the following while my code always works for the first word i enter but then segfaults once i try to enter a second word can anyone tell me why this might be giving me a segmentation fault or how i can go about fixing it thanks
student,ive been working on cardcpp and i got to the functions that need to know what the current trump is however i cant find a variable that stores that info so i dont know how to proceed i believe im missing something or are we just supposed to make that variable
student,pretty sure i implemented the code correctly to open the file but each time my function is saying the file isnt open and quitting any thoughts
student,for lab 5 have completed by strcmpeecs280 function and have successfully opened the wordstxt file but im unsure what to do from there do i need to use some sort of loop to check the user inputed word against every word in the text file or is there a simpler way to do it any hints are welcomed thanks in advance
student,would the best option to fill the char array1024 be to increment the pointer of const char name until we reach the null character
student,as i was submitting my checkpoint code to the autograder i failed one of the test cases called playertests00 and the autograder said that it would not compile i was wondering 3 things 1 if that was the test file that i submitted or if that is the test file that the autograder is attempting to run 2 are the autograder test files the same as the original test files that we have in the starter code 3 i was wondering if anyone was having this issue it just seems really weird to me that it wont compile since the other playertests file doesnt have any issues
student,i am implementing findword and i am trying to create a pointer to a cstring so that i can use this pointer as a parameter in strcmpeecs280 can someone help me figure out what is wrong with this use of a pointer char str1 str1 wordcstr word is the userentered word that we are supposed to be searching for this code results in an error message assigning to char from incompatible type const valuetype aka const char
student,are we supposed to be calling strcmp within our strcmpeecs280 function or is the intention of the lab to not do so whats the difference between the strcmp and strcmpeecs280
student,why is it that in cardtestscpp when we call the functions we use pass by reference while within the function definitions the parameters are just the parameters without the next to it this is from the cardtestscpp assertcardgetsuitacediamonds hearts diamonds this is from cardcpp suit cardgetsuitconst card cardptr suit trump if cardisleftbowercardptr trump return trump return cardptrsuit this is how i understand it but not entirely sure in cardtestscpp acediamonds points to the object acediamonds that was previously declared and since cardgetsuit asks for an address acediamonds is passed in as a parameter then in cardcpp cardptrwithout the star is an address so ultimately they both point to acediamonds
student,there is an error when compiling and i didnt know why can anyone help lab05cpp64 error cannot convert ‘stdstring’ to ‘const char’ for argument ‘1’ to ‘int strcmpeecs280const char const char’
student,i have just finished coding the packcpp portion and i get all the way to the part where it prints that the pack tests have all passed and then while stepping through when it gets to the return 0 of int main it gives the following error error memory read failed for 0x0 what does this mean my code has no warnings or errors everything is initialized etc
student,i tried calling strcmpeecs280 in my findword function using two string variables and it was flagged as an error i assume because the variables are c strings and not cstrings or pointers to cstrings im having a hard time figuring out how to convert the string word the functions parameter into a cstring in order to pass it into the function properly
student,in the struct pack struct pack card cardspacksize card next next card to be dealt i am a confused how card next is used should it be initialized how does it apply to the packinit function overall im unsure how to manipulate this variable both in my packcpp functions and in main please help
student,hey everybody im trying complete the lab a bit early and im running into some trouble with task 2 and converting the string from getuserword into a cstring so that i may use it with the strcompeecs280 function which we must use how can i get this to happen thank you all for your help in advance
student,what constitutes the lowest card lowest rank are we considering trump here
student,can someone please tell me if we have a prepost lab survey for lab 5
student,does the order of the cards in the players hand array matter or just the aggregate set of cards for example would the code be flawed if hypothetically the player shuffled hisher cards after each of hisher plays just rearranging the order of the cards not actually changing what the cards are
student,how much of the project 3 grade is the checkpoint worth
student,in our test files are we allowed to write test functions that automatically test all inputs possible or is that bad style not safe because if the test function we write is somehow buggy it may appear that we are passing all test cases when we are not for example im writing tests for cardinit there are only 24 possible inputs possible using a for loop i can test all 24 inputs is that okay or should we stick to writing test cases that look similar to the one provided cardinittwospades two spades asserttwospadesrank two twospadessuit spades
student,i had a question about the playermaketrump function so on round 2 the spec says a player will order up the suit with the same color as the up card if he has one or more face cars of that suit is this the only case that the player will order up like say the up card is a diamond and one of the players has like 4 spades on round two would he still not order up spades sorry if this is a dumb question but i dont really know euchre that well so to me it just seems like that would be the right move thanks
student,is there any special output we should choose for the screw the dealer situation
student,even if the arguments are incorrect are we supposed to output the inputted arguments
student,when i used the diff command to see what problems were in my code the compiler only told me 1d0 what does this mean
student,i was running lab05 in gdb thru cygwin to debug it and for some reason it only printed the first line and then wouldnt print anything else it acted as if it was still running but when i typed kill nothing happened i closed cygwin warned me that processes were still running and closing would kill them and then restarted cygwin and ran to compile it again at which point it told me that i couldnt change lab05exe i navigated to my documents and tried to delete the lab05exe so i could compile it anew but it tells me it cant be deleted because it is still open in lab05exe how can a program be open in itself how can i stop it from running ive closed lab05cpp in notepad and have no instances of anything from the lab still running including the entire cygwin terminal but im not sure why it keeps telling me it is running in the background
student,i just downloaded cygwin as suggested in the ide guide and i am trying to debug the lab using gdb now when i type gdb into my cygwin terminal it says command not found is there some software i need to download to use gdb if so where can i get it
student,in the cardcompare functions the spec says to return zero if cards are equal but will the function ever return zero i dont see a circumstance with equal cards given the suits being ranked
student,i ran make test and the compiler told me that my output doesnt match the expected output but it doesnt tell me where how can i check also is there any way i can just open the correct file to see what it expects the output to look like
student,should march or euchered be on the same line as the names of the winners for example if players 0 and 2 in this case named alice and cathy won and a euchered occured would the output be alice and cathy win the hand euchered or alice and cathy win the hand euchered
student,quick question about returning values from the strcmp280 function in the spec it says that strcmp280turtle turtles should be negative so would strcmp280turtles turtle be positive
student,im currently working on playeraddcard and im having problem with the tests in which the last card is being placed and handsize is incremented essentially cards 14 all have the correct handsizes 14 when i print them out in the testscpp the problem occurs on the last handsize which should be 5 within the function i increment the size by one and print the playerptrhandsize out and i get 5 however when i print it out it testscpp it 9 for some reason i tried to fix with manual if statements and that had the same results any idea as to what it is thanks
student,i think there is a point in my code where i want to pass a pointer to a function that will end up modifying the pointer is it acceptable to pass a pointer by reference and how would i go about doing that
student,card card cardinitcard rankcstr suitcstr cardprintcard rank and suit are strings why is this causing a segmentation fault
student,is this how to access a specific element of the array of cards in a pack count is an integer packptrcardscount
student,the compiler mentions that we have not declared hand and handsize in playerinit in the scope we are trying to use them playerinit why would we need to declare them again if they are part of the player struct in playerh
student,i am confused about why we need to do both of these functions dont they do the same thing modifies cardptr effects initializes card pointed to by cardptr to specified rank and suit void cardinitcard cardptr rank rank suit suit requires rank is one of two three four five six seven eight nine ten jack queen king ace suit is one of spades hearts clubs diamonds modifies cardptr effects initializes card pointed to by cardptr to specified card void cardinitcard cardptr const char rank const char suit
student,the lab says we want to prompt the user to enter a word but because we dont know how long the word is ahead of time ie before we run the program using cstrings would be difficult why instead well work with string objects from the c standard library that can hold words of arbitrary sizes i know cstrings need to have size as long as they are declared so i made the following code char chin abcde must be initialized or compile error but why cin chin cout chin chin endl it compiles but when i type in abc or 123456 the program crashes at run time saying unhandled exception at 0x00f42b8b in tryexe 0xc0000005 access violation writing location 0x00f4fde4 could anyone explain what happened in this case i then made another piece of code int intarr 0 1 2 cin intarr cout intarr0 intarr endl this one works because it only accesses a single element of the array ie intarr0 thanks a lot
student,ive written code that should open the packin file on my computer but it just doesnt open is there a specific location that the packin document should be in
student,so the card compare function that was given to us is not working the way we want it to on a specific test case this test case is for the first card compare function that we are supposed to implement parameters a b trump we have a test case that tests what happens when a is a low card of a higher ranked suit 2 of clubs and a high card of a lower ranked suit ace of spades and the trump is hearts the way our card compare function that we wrote works is that at the end of it if neither a or b is trump it calls the one that was given to us the return statement of the one given to us a b is returning a negative number indicating that b is of higher value than a which is not true in this case because of the suit rankings are we understanding the suit rankings correctly its a little confusing and different from regular euchre is the card compare function we wrote just not supposed to use the one we were given in this manner thanks
student,so this is a bit of a complicated question at least to explain ill do my best though lets say that i have two pointers to objectsstructs of the same type myobjorstrct pointera myobjorstrct pointerb i also have an array of objectsstructs that match the type of my pointers and a constant integer that represents its size const int size 10 myobjorstrct arrsize now consider the following code segment assume that the array has been validly initialized pointera arr for int i 0 i size i pointera pointerb arr size 1 so after the executive of the above snippet both pointers are pointing to the same element in the array namely the last element having index 9 now consider these comparisons assume that the operator has been properly overloaded for the objectstruct being used pointera pointerb returns false pointera pointerb returns true pointera pointerb returns false the first one i understand pointers are essentially memory locations containing a memory location in this case the memory locations of the two pointers are different because they are housed at different locations in memory when asked if these memory locations are equal the code returns false because they are not the same the second one i understand as well when i dereference a pointer i go to the location in memory referenced by the pointer and retrieve whatever objectstruct is held there because both pointers are pointing to the last element in the array following the array gets me the same objectstruct so the comparison operator will return true the second one can be misleading though if the array does not contain unique elements if im really interested in whether or not the two pointers are pointing to the same object and not different objects of equal value such as the same card and not just two different instances of a card that happen to have the same rank and suit then this comparison could theoretically return a false positive the third one is where i get confused because the way i am following the code it should return true first i dereference each pointer meaning that i retrieve the objectstruct held in the location in memory referenced by the pointer then i get its address by using the ampersand unary operator this should return the address in memory of that objectstruct in this specific case the objectstruct is at memory location arr size 1 because both pointers happen to point to this specific instance of the objectstruct both sides of the expression should evaluate to that single memory location where the objectstruct is held but in the code that i have run they evaluate to different locations the third one should tease out the potential error from the second one two different instances of objectsstructs that happen to be equivalent in value will still different at the location of memory ie they will be stored at different memory addresses if the two pointers fundamentally point to the exact same objectstruct and not just two objectsstructs of equal value then the memory locations should be the same even though the memory locations where the pointer variables are stored are different and must be necessarily if the pointers are not the same pointer variable im just not sure why the third case is evaluating the way it is if something that i have said is inaccurate anywhere then thats probably why and id be very grateful if it were pointed out if what i said is right and my code should be evaluating the way i think it should then i must have a bug somewhere else in my code that im misunderstanding when debugging if that is the case ill bring my specific lines of c in to office hours and tease through them with an instructor however i want to make sure that im understanding the arithmetic and concepts on top of just making sure that my code runs properly thank youand again sorry about the length i wanted to be thorough in my explanation and setup so that my thought process was as clear as possible
student,in this slide page under the tile shell redirection it says file io is not shell redirection but at the next page when we use file io it says its with shell redirection i am thinking the sentence in the first slide is incorrect and it should be file io is shell redirection correct me if im wrong
student,will the literal integer values returned from cardcompare functions need to be used to make further comparisons in the future or is simply knowing that the function returned a positive number so a has a higher value than be enough meaning the actual value whether its 12 100 or 1000 doesnt really matter if this wording is unclear let me know and i can elaborate
student,just want to check is it just me or is it the same with everyone since i saw lab2 and 3 had been returned
student,1 are we allowed to traverse arrays by index or do we have to traverse all of the arrays by pointer 2 i now were not supposed to pass structs in to functions by value but can we have other variable in our program that take structs as values for example can we say in our code card c some arguments that return a card object or do we have to create a pointer to a card that points to the card were trying to access
student,are we allowed to use constcast for pointers it seems like especially for the player these will be necessary for some of the rme clauses
student,hi we were wondering why all the cards in cardtestscpp were passed by reference into cardcompare and other functions is this something we should also do in our own testing if so why thanks
student,the cardh file has lots of rmes for lots of functions which ones do we need to write and which ones should we not modify whatsoever
student,i am unclear on why there are assert0 statements at the end of some of the function stubs what does this mean what is it supposed to do should we delete them after implementing our code
student,i dont really understand what this function is supposed to do based on the rme can someone help clarify
student,hello i was wondering how are structs allocated in memory like does the entire struct take up its only memory location or does every member in the struct have its own memory location
student,modifies cardptr effects initializes card pointed to by cardptr to specified rank and suit void cardinitcard cardptr rank rank suit suit but what is really modified is the card that cardptr is pointing to not the pointer itself because the pointer is passed by value to the function and can never be modified right thanks
student,hi im using microsoft visual studio to do my code before transferring it to the linux system and im working on writing the packinit function i have includeiostream includecstdlib and using namespace std at the top of my cpp file when i declare my ifstream to use for reading in the contents of the file i say ifstream inputfilestream and im given a precompiler warning by visual studio that error incomplete type is not allowed im not sure what this means and i even tried changing the variable type to be stdifstream i copied this essentially right from the lecture slides so im a bit confused as to what exactly is going on here can anyone point me in the right direction thanks
student,i was looking over the lab assignments that have been returned and saw that one of them had been marked as failed even though i believe i completed all the required components as specified is there someone in particular i should speak to about this or should i seek out any gsi
student,
student,is the led card a card not card a or b
student,if shuffling is enabled do we shuffle before hand 0 or only for each hand after that also if shuffling isnt enabled at what points are we supposed to reset the deck
student,do we have tois it recommended to use switch statements to assign rank and suit it worked fine for suit since each of the suits has a different leading character but im not sure how to use switches for rank because for example more than one rank starts with t so case t wouldnt work properly is there a way to somehow access multiple buckets of the c string at the same time
student,by return a positivenegative number do we choose a number to return or what its really confusing because at the bottom of the page it says the function always return a negative number rather than 1 so it feels like that the function is choosing a random number to return
student,what would cardcompare return for two cards of the same rank but nontrump suits for example if clubs is the trump suit and the cards compared are ace of hearts and ace of diamonds
student,im a little confused with suitnext from cardcpp in cardh the effects statement says it returns the next suit or the suit of the same color does it return two suits does it return the next suit of the same color if it only returns one suit so if hearts is the suit does it return clubs andor diamonds thanks
student,will i get penalized if i use the latter
student,i copy the same code from lecture to open a file and read information from the file but filestreamisopen is always evaluated to be true which means filestreamisopen is always evaluated to be false i have already put wordstxt together with maincpp anyone has idea about how to handle this it is from lab 5
student,would it be logical to test for a blank name or a space as the string for a test case for player name
student,i was wondering if anyone could give me a quick reminder about the difference between the two
student,what exactly is argv is it a pointer to an array of characters if i do something like the following i get a runtime error on the cout statement and my code will not run char testing50 strcpytesting0 hi cout testing0 endl
student,this file will not open on my computer is there a trick for macintosh users or is there a specific software we might need to open this file through the google docs
student,as part of the specs for the error message if one of the arguments in euchrecpp is wrong it mentions shuffle noshuffle as part of what is printed out for the error message what does this mean and how would i print it
student,spades 0 two 0 diamonds 3 ace 12 36 b has a higher value
student,for euchrecpp should we create a pointer to traverse argv or can we use indexes in this case
student,could somebody explain why theres a sanity check for null pointers in the given cardcompare function but not in any of the other functions given to us in cardcpp thanks int cardcompareconst card a const card b sanity check for null pointers asserta assertb etc
student,when i go to compile cardtests the compiler says that there is an undefined reference to all of the functions even the ones i didnt write my cardcpp file is in the correct folder as is cardtestscpp and cardh what is going wrong thanks
student,the specs say that we will need to use maxstrlen somewhere in playercpp however the only function i can see where this would be useful is playerinit and i already was able to implement that without creating a new cstring is there some point where we really need to use maxstrlen
student,the ide guide says that sublime text can be accessed in caen by using the sublimetext command in terminal however when i tried this through vnc access the command was not recognized even though i followed the steps to install the program has anyone found a way to get this command to work
student,can we trust that the functions provided to us work correctly furthermore do we need to write more test cases for these
student,thats it
student,i found some white ear buds on the floor after prof deorios 1030 lecture towards the front of the room if theyre yours let me know
student,i feel like i am implementing the shuffling wrong since the cards are almost in the same order after i am done what i am doing is taking cards 1723 and putting those cards at the front in the same order doing this three times looks like 1723 016 1016 1723 09 391016 1723 02 or 323 02 so pretty much all the cards are in the same order just starting at a different place am i doing it wrong or is it just the worlds worst shuffling function
student,bool playermaketrump takes into account 5 parameters including a const player dealer parameter the spec indicates that we should take into account the dealer when making decisions but the rmes dont really talk much about the dealer why do we include the parameter then are we supposed to have the dealer pick up and discard a separate card within the function itself the only other thing i can think of is that if playerptr dealer the dealer might take into account the card he would be picking up as a card in his theoretical hand for example say that the player pointed to by playerptr and the player pointed to by dealer are the same player let us say that the player has one face trump card in his 5 card hand and the up card is a face trump card given that the dealer has the potential to add this card to his hand do we consider this as a potential factor in the player calling trump this is the only other reason i can see to have the dealer parameter in the functionif someone can explain the purpose of the dealer parameter or how we are supposed to take the dealer into account when making trump decisions that would be great thanks in advance and sorry for the wordy and confusing question
student,the rme for packinit says that if the file the function is supposed to read in doesnt exist the function should print an error message is this just regular cout output and what exactly should the message look like
student,in the proj 3 description it shows that the conplete ordering of all card is j right brower j left bowerakq109 of tramp suit and then a of remaining 3 suits9 of remaining 3 wuit my question is that what is the order of j in the cross suits since it isnt mentioned
student,include iostream using namespace std int main int arr 0123456789 coutarrendl coutarr1endlarr1 return 0 the result is 0x7fffc6742700 0x7fffc6742728 0x7fffc6742704 my question is that i dont know what does arr 1 mean here why it seems that there is an addition of 28 in memory address even though i write 1 in the code thank
student,so i am writing player and i am failing the test case that looks like this copied from playertests not my code bob will throw away the upcard if its lower than the cards in his hand playeraddanddiscard bob ninespades assertbobhandsize 5 for int i0 ibobhandsize i assert playerhascardinhand awesomespadeshand i bob i cant find this in playerh or playercpp i am i just blind missing something or do we not have to write this function i am still failing the assert here but i wasnt sure if it is because of the playeradddiscard function or this one thank you
student,im not sure if this question is too much to ask so if it is just let me know but im thinking about how to implement the cardinit function but im having some trouble about how to approach it obviously one very tedious way to do it would be a lot of if statements but i feel like there has to be an easier way so i guess my question is is there anyway to take a character array and convert it to something other than a c string because we cant use those that i could then pass to a function instead of passing the pointer to it thanks
student,i had a hard time doing lab 4 and i ended up wrongly submitting one part of it does anyone have the code for slideright flip and duplicate thanks
student,for the description of card compare it says returns zero if cards are equal would this ever happen in our version of euchre
student,in the cardtestscpp provided im a little confused as to how the cards are being initialized for some tests such as above the above the cardcompare testing there are a few lines with something like card nineclubs nine clubs while above some other tests there were lines with something like cardinittwospades two spades im sorry if this is a dumb question but is there a difference between these two initialization methods
student,we failed at rotateboundary but we got the right result in our test case if we have a list 12345 we tested rotate function by passing n as 0 and 5 and they all gave the result 12345 what kind of boundary situation does this test case consider
student,i was wondering how i could get access to the post lab survey if i accidentally deleted the original email do i have to email the admins or my gsi
student,i know questions have been answered regarding the rules of ranking and comparison in euchre and i understand those rules however i am wondering what our compare function ought to return if i am comparing two nontrump cards that also are not following suit of the led card would it be 0 since they are technically of equal value or would our function return the value of a normal comparison ie comparecard a cardb in this case for example trump is hearts leading suit is diamonds card a is ace of spades card b is king of clubs
student,if this information is even public and i know that writing more test cases will contribute to a better grade total and etc im wondering about our actual test cases that youll run against buggy code and compare outputs
student,if the left bower leads a round is the lead suit the trump suit or the opposite for example if hearts were trump and jack of diamonds led would the lead suit be hearts or diamonds
student,in the packtest file we are given a test that looks like this pack pack packinitpack packin for the packinit function 1 do i need to put my files in in format or is txt acceptable 2 i thought that the function took in a cstring but this looks like a regular string to me so i am not really sure what is going on there
student,when will we be notified of our grades
student,how to go about assigning ranksuits to cards like an example would be how to assign each ranksuit from a pack or like in initializing the card with the const char rank and const char suit ranksuits are of type rank and suit and the parameters in cardinit are of const charsoo im kinda confused on how to approach this
student,hi im just wondering when the autograder would be ready since we already finished the project thanks
student,hello my partner and i were looking at the code tonight and were confused in the cardtestscpp file there is already a lot of what looked like test cases written for us in this file do we still need to implement more tests if so where do we start and how many more should we do
student,these two sentences are both about the rule of ordering up in second round if all players pass during the first round there is a second round of declaring again beginning with the eldest hand this time each player in turn may either pass or order up by naming a suit other than the rejected suit during round two a player will order up the suit with the same color as the up card if he has one or more face cards of that suit in his hand so if up card is diamond can we only order up hearts or can we order up any other suit i am a little confused
student,on the cardcompare function with the leading card as a parameter if the trump suit is diamonds the leading card is a jack of hearts right bower and the 2 cards being passed into cardcompare are an ace of hearts and a queen of clubs what should this function be returning we are unclear if it should return 1 since the ace is of the trump suit and the queen is not or 0 since the right bower has been played and thus both the queen of clubs and the ace of hearts are technically equal because of the bower having been played int cardcomparequeenclubs acehearts jackhearts hearts
student,sooorder of cards is jtrump suitright bower jleft bower atrump suit ktrump suit qtrump suit 10trump suit 9trump suit a k q j 10 9 of all other suits following the order of spades hearts clubs diamond

student,how would i go about resetting the pointer back to the first card
student,int arr 1 2 3 4 5 cout arr endl an address cout arr endl the same address as above why the outputs are the same specifically what is the difference btw arr and arr what do they represent i notice the similar result for the following code char arr4 123x 456 789 an array of pointers to cstrings cout arr4 endl an address cout arr4 endl the same address i know arr4 gives 123x and it is the same as arr40 but again what is the difference btw arr4 and arr4 thanks a lot
student,i think if i want to check the pointtowin is within the range i have to convert the argv3 the char type variable into an int i found a function in cstring library called atoi can do this work are we supposed to use this function or there are other method to do this conversion or avoid the conversion
student,i forgot to submit my lab yesterday i assume since it is late i am sol does completing the post lab survey still count for anything as i have done the lab just not submitted it is there any account i could email the lab code to for partial credit thank you

student,can you please host this sessioneuchre lessons project 3 getting started on a week day
student,for void cardinitcard cardptr const char rank const char suit why is it wrong to do cardptrrank rank and cardptrsuit suit
student,how do i delete a file in my code in eecs 280 labster
student,when i run make test it gives me an error because the correct output has the command that is run ie euchre packin noshuffle 1 alice bob cathy drew as the first line whereas my output file does not have this the spec says nothing about this but are we supposed to cout the command that the user outputs if not how can i make sure that make test passes the diff checking of the files or how can i automatically add the command to my output file other than this first line the both files are exactly the same so im sure that diff checker is complaining because of that one line
student,how are we supposed to handle names that are longer than 1024 characters should we just drop the remaining letters print an error the specs doesnt cover how we should handle this the most obvious way to me seems to be using strncpy for the string and dropping the remaining letters
student,can someone explain why rank includes cards 2 8 and doesnt just include the cards that are used in a euchre deck 9 10 j q k a
student,sorry if this is a bad question i did look around for a while i have implemented the 3 functions in cardcpp that say implement me i see that we have some testing to do but i cant find anything else am i missing something
student,so i just had a quick question how do you call a function on a struct i see that you can do something like ab or ab but what if your function has multiple inputs for example cardistrump in project 3 you have to pass the pointer and the trump type would i call this using something like a cardptrcardistrumptrumpsuit bcardptrcardistrumptrumpsuit ccardistrumpcardptr trumpsuit d none of those i feel like im making this way harder than it needs to be if someone could explain which one i would use and why i cant use the other ones maybe along with an example of it i would really appreciate it thanks
student,i just wanted to confirm that i understand card order in regards to trump and leading suits so if the trump and leading suit are the same the order would be j trump j left bower a k q 10 9 trump and then the rest of the cards in the order they would evaluate under the first cardcompare otherwise if trump and leading suits were different the cards would be j trump j left bower a k q 10 9 trump a k q j assuming not left bower 10 9 leading suit and then the rest of the cards in the order they would evaluate under the first cardcompare is this understanding correct
student,when initializing players it is okay to represent an empty hand with
student,can someone please help explain the enum data type that is used in cardh i learned a bit by searching the internet but i would like to know more about how were supposed to use it in the project thanks
student,hello i was looking at the removeduplicates function in lab and i couldnt figure our any way to do it without either 1 altering the size of the original array which im not sure is even possible or 2 creating another container array to hold the new array so going back to 1 if it is possible how would one go about it i learn best by examples so a simple snippet would be greatly appreciated
student,is it safe to assume that every player in the game will have a different name
student,in the final cardcompare function we take into account the card that was led i am fairly well versed in euchre so i understand the importance of the led card and trump but assume that both cards are offsuitin this case given that neither card truly has any utility in the hand do we still evaluate their pure numerical values of the cards and return positive if card a is greater than card b and negative vice versa or do we return 0 because both cards have the same functional futility in the current hand i hope my question makes sensesorry for any confusion or silliness thanks in advance
student,i filled out the alternate exam form and got a confirmation email but i havent received a follow up as noted in the regular exam info email sent out a few days ago have they just not sent it out yet
student,ive been having some trouble figuring this function out and i was hoping someone could help me out i get that were supposed to shift the elements by one and we can dereference the pointer to do that but i keep getting a oneoff error also im not really sure how to use the placeholder variable for the last element thats been mentioned
student,const char b def in this line of code b is essentially a pointer to d and by definition const char means whatever the pointer points to is a const value and in this case it should be d so d should be the element that is unmodifiable but when cant the rest elements that b does not directly point to be modified why cant we change e and f thanks
student,i just had a few questions about project 3 1 say that the trump suit is clubs then would the order be jspades jclubs a k q 10 9spades a k q j 10 9diamond a k q j 10 9hearts and a k q 10 9clubs 2 the project 3 spec says that the first dealer is the first player so is that constant throughout the game or with each new hand does the first player change since the dealer changes 3 for the dealing the person to the left gets 3 cards then the next gets 2 next gets 3 next gets 2 then you start at 2 the second time around and go around again right 4 is the up card the same as the card that was turned up after dealing 5 when it says each other hand must follow the led suit is that the same as each of the other hands or is it saying every other hand 6 under the euchre strategy section it says he then discards the lowest card among his hand and the turnup for a final total of five cards wouldnt the dealer then have 4 cards since he adds one to his hand of 5 the up card and gets rid of 2 the lowest card and the trump card
student,when i try to use strcpy in playercpp there is an error report saying that it is unsafe to use strcpy and suggest me to use strcpys am i allowed to use strcpys and why there is such a error report
student,my partner and i decided to get started with project three and were a little bit confused on exactly how to begin we started with cardinitcard cardptr const cdar rank const char suit but were confused as to how we should convert a char into a rank or suit class
student,so i am trying to make a full deck or two of my own combination shuffle for testing purposes however none of the functions seem to be super happy with that even though i can point to the first element of it do i need to be making a in file in order to read in my own array of card ie a pack is that even allowed thank you
student,the spec says that a player needs to consider the player who dealt the spec doesnt specify how to take this into account suggestions please thanks in advance
student,my question is whats the differences between unsigned integers and signed integers and under what circumstances should we use unsigned integers thank you in advance
student,this is probably a dumb question but i was looking through the traversal section in lab 4 and i saw that the starting point for the loop was the first elements address which is what we assigned to some integer pointer what im wondering is how the computer knows that it should assign the first elements location to the int pointer when the statement just says int ptr arr is that just a property built into the language so we can assume this always works also just to make sure im understanding this loops process correctly whats happening is that ptr points to the first elements address in arr initially then sum is increased by the value stored in that address afterwards ptr is incremented and it then points to the next location in arr and the process repeats until ptr would point to an element one further then arrs end is this correct thanks in advance for reference this is the code im talking about
student,so ive done all the labs and im sure in a week or so ill be so into project 3 i wont be asking for even more practice but are there any resources you would recommend for someone who wants to practice and cement their knowledge of pointers
student,im confused about the rank order of nontrump cards in euchre when i played the game on my ipad i believe that the game i downloaded has similar rules as those listed in the spec however sometimes the winner of a trick is not the player i expected especially when everyone played a nontrump card could anyone explain the rank order of those nontrump cards some extra examples will be awesome thanks
student,my solution to removeduplicates does not work due to the 9 in the given solution after trying to figure out why and failing i decided that the easy way out was to question the solution itself sooo per the rme below should the 9 be in the solution or does it fall into that rest of the list doesnt matter category because its not unique rme and test code below to save time requires there are at least n elements in arr the elements of arr are sorted in ascending order there may be duplicates modifies arr effects returns the number of unique elements and now arr begins with those unique elements in sorted order the rest of the array doesnt matter note you must use traversal by pointer your solution must be inplace and run in linear time int removeduplicatesint arr int n given test code int arr310 13344457 99 cout testing removeduplicates endl cout solution 1 3 4 5 7 9 endl int num removeduplicatesarr310 cout your code printarraypointerarr3num cout endl
student,so i started to dig into the card section and i was just wondering should we be using helper functions or is it just personal preference also do we only have to do the functions that say implement on them because i am a little confused about cardinit since it has code in it but it doesnt seem complete to me thanks
student,i am a bit unclear on how to shift the array i am trying to do ptr ptr 1 to shift right but this seems to be going out of array bounds is there another way i should think about to logic to approach this
student,are cstrings automatically nullterminated by the compiler if so does that mean we dont need to add in the null terminator to manipulate code like in lecture today example code below int strlenchar s char p s while p p return p s int main char pop eat pop0 int count strlenpop cout count endl when i take out the nullterminator from the array and run the code i am unable to get it to extend beyond the array bounds ie it runs fine this makes me suspect that the nullterminator is indeed added by the compiler and i dont need to include it please advise
student,when writing our tests cases for the pack functions can we create and use our own packin file or will this not work with the autograder
student,hi i dont understand what the following sentences mean could someone explain this thanks your solution should also run in linear time meaning the time it takes your code to run should scale up linearly with the length of the array informally this means the number of passes you make over the array should not depend on the length of the array
student,feel free to contact me at andpearlumichedu
student,why doesnt this work ptr ptr labster is telling me that the two pointers dont come from the same array
student,for slide right do we have to alter the array and then call a printarray function or can we just cout each number so that on the screen it appears to be slid right
student,int arr 1 2 3 4 int ptr arr ptr 5 so post increment means we assign 1 to ptr first and then update ptr right so it would be 5 2 3 4 right thanks
student,i am confused on how you can flip two values without losing one of them for flip i have a pointer to the first value and a pointer to the last value but how can i change each of them to point to each other without losing one of their values first i also have the same issue for slideright where i am trying to store a previous value and update it i am still quite fuzzy on the concept of pointers so thank you in advance for any clarifications
student,are we allowed to hold the last element in the array like this int holder arrn 1
student,for any array arr the expressions arrx and arr x are equivalent is that true include iostream using namespace std int main int arr3 cout arr55 arr 55 return 0 it prints 1 but is it true for any array thanks
student,seeking a partner for project 3 who lives or would be willing to meet on central contact me at zakrbumichedu thanks
student,i must be misunderstanding the shuffling algorithm if you just cut the deck in half 3 times and swap the parts isnt this the same as just swapping the two halves once that doesnt seem very shuffled to me
student,what should happen if packnext is called after all cards have been used should the pack reset
student,for the cardcompare functions can we assume that a and b will be different cards
student,i was trying to write slideright and flip fort he lab but im unsure how it is possible to do this if we do not know the size of the array
student,hi i am a little confused about the requirement saying may not use another array would anyone help explain this thank you
student,is there anyway i can turn this in please help
student,are we allowed to modify the card starter code in case we want to for instance i want to overload the operator so that i can cout cards like cout cardptr instead of having to call cardprintcardptr on a separate line every single time so i adjusted the cardcpp starter code to achieve this is this allowed
student,if my partner submitted to autograder and both of us got the email confirming the score do i have to submit it as well
student,do we need to use assert for all the functions or will printing out a variety of cases also be acceptable
student,i am able to find where to insert elt and attach it to the node where it belongs but i am confused as to how to make sure it attaches to the whole entire original tree
student,im a little confused about the ranking of the cards with regard to trump will a queen of diamonds be greater than a ace of spades if the trump suit is hearts
student,when i submit my tar i get the notice that your submission was missing the following files grouptxt p2testscpp p2cpp but when i open the file it shows all three files in there im submitting it on caen how do i make the tar so that the autograder recognizes the files
student,can someone please tell me on how to write rme for helper functions the helper functions have the exact same effect as mentioned in p2h file writing the rme clauses will be like repeating the information already mentioned in p2h file thank you
student,i understand that we need to be running the caen computer in linux to properly compile our code but how exactly do we reboot the computer in linux when does the computer give us the option for what os to run in
student,was there a mistake in rme of lab4 it says that the array is sild right but the example given is actually slid left
student,the spec says on the first page that in screw the dealer the dealer must call a suit different from the up card then later on page 3 it says the dealer will always call the suit of the up card in this situation which is it for our purposes
student,can we use the code for treeequal found in testhelpers as a helper for containedby
student,when i use make test to test the functions i have made so far how am i supposed to interpret what it gives me in my simpletestout im given four lists and the last one is different from the last list in simpletestoutcorrect but how do i know which function of mine is failing my output for simpletestout 1 2 3 4 5 11 12 13 14 15 5 4 3 2 1 1 3 5 11 12 13 14 15 my output for simpletestoutcorrect 1 2 3 4 5 11 12 13 14 15 5 4 3 2 1 1 2 3 4 5 11 12 13 14 15
student,this one looks like a biggie d good luck on project 3 everyone
student,how do we check through an entire tree a to see if the elements match up with that in b the element from a can be located anywhere in b how do we know if we should check right or left sub trees
student,when running tests i get an error listexception error empty list as mentioned in previous posts so i was wondering for insertlist it says the list must have at least n elements but that n must be greater than or equal to 0 so we tried testing an empty list with this function and this error came as no surprise does the list passed in have to not be empty
student,how exactly are we supposed to copy cardcppstarter to cardcpp
student,for the fibonacci numbers is there the 0th number
student,this code int main int arr 1234 gives me a semantic error in labster must specify length when declaring an array even though this code is perfectly legal c as a side note int arr4 1234 int ptr arr 1 ptr ptr doesnt give me a warning about undefined behavior on the third line sequence pointsequencedbefore rules
student,your tests must use assertfalse or return nonzero from main in order to show that a test has failed does this mean our asserts should come out as false i am having trouble understanding what is trying to be said here
student,i am still failing filtertest when i enter the command make test or submit my tarred file to the autograder my filter function appears to be working though so i cant imagine how this could be happening could it be a result from not correctly implementing containedby which is something i have not yet fixed
student,hi is it ok to put all our helper function declarations at the top of p2cpp and then the definitions of the helper functions later in the file right before the function theyre helping or do the declarations have to be right next to the definitions thanks
student,what does this error indicate p2tests error 1 also i understand that warnings are being treated as errors when we use make test but if we understand and are okay with the code despite the warnings can we keep it the same or will that count against us on grading
student,ive been working on containedby for approximately 1030273239 hours and my plan of action was to first go through treeb until the center of a appears but how would one visit every element in a tree so that the base case when left and right subtrees are empty goes back to the root of the subtree pleasehelpive already shed too many tears over this project
student,when i use make test to run my test cases through the code i get the following error terminate called after throwing an instance of listexception what error empty list based on similar posts in piazza the error seemed to be calling a function on an empty list i went through the code three times and changed all instances in which this error was present however the terminal error is still showing are there any other possible explanations
student,do our test cases have to use assert in order to receive credit in the autograder
student,i get the correct output for simpletests when i test it with my functions but for the auto grader i still get 01 anyone know the problem or how that could work thanks
student,i am trying to test containedby and i am receiving this error terminate called after throwing an instance of treeexception what error tree empty aborted i am not sure what this is referring to because the both trees are not empty what is the best way to test containedby can i just return containedby with the input of two trees that i created
student,in project3 what does midproject checkpoint due 19th feb mean does the first half of project will be graded by 19th feb
student,for all the specific functions we were asked to write not including the helpers do we have to write rmes even though they were given to use word for word
student,since a bool nontail recursive function will have multiple stack frames that are either true or false what will the ultimate or ending bool value be sorry that this is worded poorly for example if i have 3 stacks and the bottom one returns false will the bool function still work its way back up to the first stack and possibly end up returning true overall or just return false and stop
student,how do we test our answer against the autograders answer to assert false i dont believe we learned this concept and have seen people mention it but we did not learn how to do this can someone provide an explanation how to do this to catch bugs against the autograder
student,hello i am wondering what input should i include for the test functions for accumulation and filter cuz i keep getting the following error p2testscpp in function ‘void testfilterlistt int’ p2testscpp179 error ‘oddnum’ was not declared in this scope plus are we supposed to get 1 or 0 after each test case since the test helper functions returns 1 or zero
student,i wrote a lot of helper function for the tail recursive functions and they basically do all or most of the work in the original functions descriptions because of this my rmes sound pretty similar to the original ones and im just wondering if thats ok
student,where are maias office hours the location is not listed on the calendar
student,i received the email for the lab04 prelab but not one for the post labis there no post lab this week has it not been sent out yet did other people receive it and i didnt
student,in acculmulation test i got invalid conversion from ‘void int int’ to ‘int int int’ may i know what causes this please thanks everyone
student,i have written both the print array by index and by pointer and im getting the correct numbers however in the labster console when i test the code i see the solution has spaces between the numbers unlike mine is it required that i add in spaces between my numbers when i cout
student,project complies on xcode and caen through ssh and passes all of the tests but when i make the tar file and turn it in the autograder says that none of the test cases compile it gives me this response test case results test case p2tests failed to compile p2tests 01 test case simpletest failed to compile simpletest 01 test case treeinserttest failed to compile treeinserttest 01 test case filtertest failed to compile filtertest 01 total score 04 has anyone had this problem and knows what to do
student,my lab 04 prelab did not load the writing code page however it says i completed the prelab what can i do to still get credit
student,ptr points to certain element in an array so i think its more like an address then why cant you move whats in an address to another address is it because pointer cannot modify values if thats the case then why ptr ptr 1 works or why does it have to be ptr ptr 1
student,i wanted to double check that binary trees can include negative integers thanks in advance
student,for many of our test cases we use for loops to quickly test many outputs and then visually check them do we need asserts in our tests for these this becomes difficult mainly testing functions like inserttree where we use for loops to test a wide range of values and then visually check them
student,how do you create the archive to submit to the autograder the spec doesnt go into very much detail and im not sure how to go about this in terminal
student,for the tree 8 12 10 14 13 15 what happens when you try to insert 8 or 12 or 14 any element that is higher up in the tree and is not empty when testing this my code would insert 8 as the left subtree of 10 the first time we ran this test case our program ended with exit code 1 when we ran the same test again it ended with exit code 0 so i have two questions did our code put the 8 in the correct spot does the exit code of 1 mean we have a seg fault or other issue that will fail the autograder plz help
student,for the category under the auto grader simple tests is that just running the file we got with project 2 called simple tests or is there more thats its doing thanks
student,the question tells me to write an implementation for a function that finds the minimum element in an integer array and returns the total whats total referring to is this just a typo or am i completely missing something
student,so in this case tree a is not covered by b tree a 4 7 5 tree b 4 7 9
student,can someone please help me out with my filter function this is what it prints as of now i am stuck in trying to get the first values of these lists into one list that i can then return any suggestions thanks
student,so if i understand the other posts i have read through the only unique rmes i need to write will be for helper functions is this correct i have put basic comment notes on my tests and the rmes for the functions we wrote were provided in the spec am i missing anything thanks in advance for the clarification
student,are our contained functions expected to handle treeas with more than 2 tiers treea example
student,getting this error p2testscpp9825 error called object type int is not a function or function pointer int product productlista not sure whats wrong since lista is a list and im assigning the return value to an integer which is what the function returns
student,where can we find materials for lab 4
student,is it necessary to use function stubs i havent used any function stubs in p2cpp file thank you
student,when we are submitting the project and we worked with a partner do both of us each have to submit one copy
student,im getting this error libcabidylib terminating with uncaught exception of type treeexception error tree empty abort trap 6 any hint as to what im doing wrong in my function its basically ifelse within an if and an else the first branch is to determine if the element is less than or greater than the root the second is to determine whether or not the tree is empty
student,i am currently working on my containedby function and upon testing it using make test the terminal gave me the following error terminating with uncaught exception of type treeexception error tree empty im guessing this means that im stepping too far into an empty tree however in my function actually my helper function i initially test for both or either tree being empty before doing any further function calls anyone have an idea for a fix for this issue
student,can i include the string library for the p2 tests
student,i am so lost on this function could someone please lend some help here was my basic plan 1 create a tree for the element were inserting 2 iterate through the tree and compare element were inserting to current nodes element then go right or left based on whether its bigger or smaller 3 insert the tree there then get back to the original tree with this part inserted in this part is the most confusing for me as you can probably see is there a flaw in my plan besides the uncertain ending also could someone go into a bit more detail on how to approach the ending
student,i just saw google drive with the sample p2tests file with a sample test case but is it okay we format it in a different way i wrote my test cases like this mock test case cout the sum of list a suma endl assert 24 suma is this okay or should the test cases contain the expected outputs and constants
student,i used assertfalse as function stubs but it keeps aborting saying that the assertion false has failed when it gets to listt reverse so i cant test the functions using my p2tests does anyone know how i can fix this
student,if i wrote a getlength function as well as a getlengthhelper function in p2cpp should i include rmes above both functions or just one which one thanks
student,so heres a pseudocode version of what i essentially have void testingcontainedbytree 1 tree 2 bool expectedvalue bool actualvalue containedby1 2 assertactualvalue expectedvalue when i run my p2testscpp i get this message in regards to the containedby tester function p2tests p2testscpp183 void testcontainedbytreet treet bool assertion expected actual failed i have checked manually and my i am putting the right inputs into the tester function as in if tree 1 is contained by tree 2 i am putting true i also purposely put in the wrong bool value to see if anything changes but same error message additionally i have tested containedby on its own and it works i have tried 01 instead of truefalse im pretty lost right now could i just skip the tester function altogether and test containedby alone should i do anything else
student,twas the day of snow classes after blizzards had whirled no code was compiling not even hello world snow angels were coded by programmers with care in hopes that tail recursion might somehow be there theyd compiled old frosty and made a good plan but somehow couldnt cout aprettysnowman away to stack overflow they flew like a flash to find something to give to that nasty old bash the sun on the breast of the newfallen snow gave a striking idea for some objects below then what to my wondering eyes did appear but a snow angel function and helper func dear now recurse now recurse now recurse and recurse on if statements on boolians on listt and treet to the base case to the listisempty now debug away debug away debug away all and please professor with a pretty function call shout out to perry lee for collaboration and the pieces of paper were supposed to say something but theyre illegible oh well snowangeltailrecursion2jpg
student,what do i do if this occurs make test segmentation fault
student,so i understand the concept of what to do to go through the tree and find where to insert the element however i am still confused as to how to build the tree back up with this element inserteddoes anyone have any advice as to where to start with this
student,i dont quite understand what putting each test case in a function means or what its supposed to look like in p2testscpp could someone give me an idea or example thanks
student,im writing my covered by function and passing in the 2 trees it should return a true if tree a is covered by tree b and false if it is not covered by tree b correct also in order for a to be covered by b that means tree a needs to be smaller than tree b right i want to make sure im not confusing what coverby means if you physically take tree a and put it over tree b tree b would be displayed right visual learner over here thanks
student,are we allowed to use pass by reference for our helper functions thanks
student,i declared a helper function for filter but i cannot call it in my filter function
student,how should we go about testing the treeinsert function currently i am using treeprint to print out the tree before and after and checking to see if the element is inserted in the right place as i am fairly sure asserts wont work unless we take every element and compare individually would calling traversal and comparing lists using the listequal function be a viable option or is there another preferred method thanks
student,when i run the project on my computer everything runs and works but when i go onto caen through ssh none of my files will compile and i get an error also i submitted to the autograder and i got a 44 so what should i do this is what comes up in terminal
student,do we need to comment on p2test
student,i have done the treesum but i dont know how to do traversal i didnt use any helper function i am thinking about using recursive and break each tree into tree left int elt and tree right then use append and listmake to make the list but i always got an empty list after running the test is there anything wrong with the base case i use if tree is empty return an empty list thank you
student,ive been working on this all weekend really the trees are throwing me off however my question is how to recursively get through each side of the tree on the boolean function containedby on the other functions you can essentially nest them but since this is returning a boolean value you cannot do that so im very stuck on how to check every single part of the tree rather than just the left of the right
student,just to seek clarification is it necessary to include recursiveh in either p2cpp or p2testcpp given that i have already included p2h in the header i guess i am not clear about include in general since recursiveh has already been included in p2h does this mean that whenever i include p2h i get access to the functions in recursiveh
student,i know were supposed to keep the element of the list if the function that is passed in evaluates to true and strip it of the element if it evaluates to false i have a filterhelper that does the work but how do i know what to pass in as the int for fn for example when i evalute if fn true what can i put in the parentheses thanks
student,im using a helper that takes in a tree and list im working backwards i know i need to append two lists list from the left tree element and the list from the right tree im calling traversalhelper which returns a list so that way both arguments in append are lists any hints as to what im missing i know that we have to approach the function by separating the tree into left element and right but dont know how to go about translating the tree nodes into a list and returning it
student,im having trouble submitting my project every time i try to make tar i get this bash41 make tar make no rule to make target grouptxt needed by tar stop what is grouptxt i know it is needed for submission any help would be greatly appreciated
student,hi im having a problem with my filter and append functionswhen i try to compile y code i get this error can anyone help me out
student,each time after i compile my recursivecpp and p2testscpp files disappear as in when i open recursivecpp it is blank and when i try to save p2testscpp it says the file has been modified since reading it so when i try to compile the next time i get undefined reference errors to the functions like listisempty listfirst listrest treeright etc any idea why this is happening
student,i tried posting this earlier but is professor deorio still having office hours tomorrow despite his lecture being cancelled
student,so the email from the university says no events and classes until 6pm are the office hours going to be cancelled as well
student,is the due date of project 2 pushed back because of the snowday just wondering
student,just to make sure i implemented treeinsert correctly if elt is equal to a number in a tree it should go right correct thanks
student,both my computer and my partners computer gives wrong numbers for when we try to sum or product extremely large numbers how can we fix this or does it actually matter
student,is there a way to implement this function without using any recursive calls
student,i wrote the coveredby function for containedby as recommended in the spec additionally as was mentioned i made it static just like the rest of the helper functions however i would like to use the coveredby function in p2testscpp am i allowed to make the coveredby function nonstatic or should i copy and paste it to the other file
student,i read in the packet that an empty tree is a sorted binary tree what would an elt inserted into a empty tree look like insert is is supposed to insert an elt at a leaf but empty trees do not have leaves
student,when we try to test a lot of our functions we keep getting uncaught exception errorsdoes anyone know what could be causing this
student,not sure why im getting these compiler errors for a file that i havent modified recursiveh918 note candidate function not viable no known conversion from int to const treet aka const binarytree for 2nd argument treet treemakeint elt const treet left const treet right recursiveh878 note candidate function not viable requires 0 arguments but 3 were provided treet treemake testing in main by calling treemake426 and assigning it tree then printing it whats going on
student,ive looked through the related questions on this topic but im still having trouble understanding how to build the tree back up after you iterate down to the location where you insert the new tree if you call treemake what would you put for the element when youre moving up instead of looking down
student,i dont know what im doing wrong with my implementation of filter all i am getting are empty lists should i be making a new list and calling recursion on this new list
student,do we need to include function prototypes at the beginning of our programs do we need to comment them with rme clauses does p2cpp need prototypes for every function at the start of the file do we need to write prototypes for all of our helper functions if yes do we need to comment with rme clauses does p2testscpp need prototypes for all of our testing functions
student,do we need to comment or rme clauses for functions that we created for test cases in p2tests also do we need to name tree variables correctly for insert traversal and functions in p2tests i just made the names of trees to be tree1 treea treec or something along that line would you take off points for those
student,what is the limit for how long a program is allowed to run in the autograder if one of my functions say the nontailrecursive fib function takes a long time to run on large inputs say fib46 is this going to be a problem additionally if also i have a test case in p2testscpp that calls that function with an input like that and hence takes a long time to run is this a problem
student,so my understanding is that memory in a computer is linear making it easy to visualize and understand how variables lists pointers and arrays are saved how does the computer save the tree in a method that helps it to remember the values does it just link the different parts to each other similar to a network of pointers
student,should asserts be removed when submitting to the autograder
student,are we allowed to use functions in testhelpers in our p2 functions
student,were getting a ton of nasty compilation errors when we tried compiling the project and test code together i know this is pretty indecipherable but did anyone encounter a similar problem and find a solution
student,what will happen if 2 is inserted in this tree 3 1 3 4 5
student,on the specs it is written that containedby is supposed to return true or false however my function returns 0 or 1 even when i wrote in containedby to return true or false is this acceptable if not is there a way to make the function only able to return true or false thanks
student,i have treesum down but for some reason i cant get traversal to work i am thinking of using the listappend function but not sure if that is the correct way to do it for the return statement i have listmaketreeelttree list but this just overwrites the element that was in the previous stack any hints
student,when i make my submittargz and submit it to the autograder i get a 44 but it says submission not counted towards submission limit is this whats supposed to happen i assume that im fine because i got a 44 but im not sure if im doing something wrong does everybody else get the same message when they submit to the autograder
student,do we need to write our own tests for the insert and filter functions seeing as tests are provided i know its good practice to write our own but i was wondering whether it was specifically required
student,if we are not using accumulate function to implement sum or product will we lose point
student,just wondering if were going to have class tomorrow given the weather
student,are we allowed to use functions that we wrote in the project like append in our other functions
student,do we need to be concerned with doubles in project 2 or can we assume everything will be integers
student,hey i had a few quick questions regarding the tree functions first are we allowed to make helper functions for the tree functions second if we are allowed to make helper functions and our helper functions are recursive does the original function need to be recursive as well or are we ok if just the helper functions are recursive thanks
student,4 2 5 3 would not cover 2 3 right but even though the first tree wouldnt cover the second tree the second tree is still contained by the first tree is my understanding correct
student,after writing a very thorough test suite for all our functions my partner and i saw the advice about putting test cases into functions to help with readability i know thats a protip but is it mandatory will we lose any points if our test suite isnt structured like this
student,i just cant seem to get the accumulate function could someone guide me in the right direction of its base case
student,i decided to use vim for this project and i finished the project successfully and tested it thoroughly without any problems however today when attempting to run some more tests my curly braces have turned to äs and ås my array brackets have turned to äs and ås etc do any vim users know what might have caused this i am very new to vi so this came as a shock to me
student,i have seen in previous posts that the most recent submission between the two partners will be graded so does that mean that we can just have one of us submit the project because this would be our most recent submission i ask this because he is working on a mac and im on pc and it would be easiest if he just submits once for the both of us of course both our names and uniqnames are in the p2cpp and grouptx he submitted
student,if we split up our test case file into multiple functions and delete the int main function will this mess up the grading
student,if we wrote a coveredby function as a helper function for containedby can our coveredby rme simply state something like returns true if a is covered by b or do we have to define what covered by means in our rme
student,since ill have to create functions to test accumulate and filter those extra functions are defined in p2testscpp and not p2cpp right
student,in traversal it wants us to make a list of all elements in the tree from left to right in the case of this tree would it be 0 1 2 3 4 5 5 6 or 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 5 4 2 5 1 3 6 0 5
student,hi i have a problem with comparing the list for example when i test append funciton it stated that the assertion failed however the outcome is as follow append test expected list appended list the error assesrtion expectedlist listappended failed may i know why is this so or we should use other method of testing instead of directly comparing two lists thanks
student,every time i try to compile the filtertestcpp and inserttreetestcpp i get these linker errors is this an issue with the listequal function and the treeequal function or is it an issue with the functions i wrote thanks
student,im trying to use the c11 standards defaultrandomengine for test cases it works fine in visual studio but g calls out the following even with the stdc0x flag set engine and u are used in the random enginerelated lines of code g wall werror pedantic o2 stdc0x p2testscpp p2cpp recursivelistcpp binarytreecpp recursivecpp testhelperscpp o p2tests p2testscpp16 error ‘stddefaultrandomengine’ has not been declared p2testscpp in function ‘listt rand20’ p2testscpp54 error ‘defaultrandomengine’ does not name a type p2testscpp58 error ‘engine’ was not declared in this scope p2testscpp in function ‘int getran20’ p2testscpp69 error ‘defaultrandomengine’ does not name a type p2testscpp70 error expected initializer before ‘’ token p2testscpp71 error ‘engine’ was not declared in this scope p2testscpp71 error ‘u’ was not declared in this scope p2testscpp in function ‘int getran5’ p2testscpp76 error ‘defaultrandomengine’ does not name a type p2testscpp77 error expected initializer before ‘’ token p2testscpp78 error ‘engine’ was not declared in this scope p2testscpp78 error ‘u’ was not declared in this scope any ideas on how to get it to work the alternative is to use the standard c rand function and the book says thats bad google results reference potential solutions that vary based on the compiler version a stdc11 flag is regularly mentioned but our g evidently doesnt implement it
student,i want to confirm my understanding of assert are we essentially comparing the expected value with the actual value outputted by our function so for the assert statement of sum can we write lista 1 5 assertsumlista 6 because we know that it should add up to six
student,i saw a post saying that once we got reverse working well it would make append a lot easier however ive written append and am still stuck on reverse i think i can use append to make reverse work but based on that other post i feel like this is backwards am i doing something totally wrong thanks in advance
student,it was mentioned in spec that we should declare all the helper functions as static but it seemed we cannot declare coveredby as static
student,how do we make test cases for accumulate and filter in the p2 tests file i am confused about the general notation and what we should pass into accumulate and into filter
student,what should happen if empty lists are passed into filterodd filtereven and filter
student,just wondering if you will be giving us some impossible test cases such as the tree below 4 5
student,i do not really get how coveredby could make containedby much simplerand easier can someone explain that
student,i noticed in lab 3 typedef was used can we use typedef in accumulate and filter to make it cleaner
student,i am stuck on the accumulate function do i need to write a helper function for accumulate like i did for most of the other functions thanks
student,in my p2cpp ive made a helper function that converts lists to arrays as well as a helper function that gets the length of a list when i try to initialize an array to have a const int length i get this error in the compiler p2cpp26010 error variable length arrays are a c99 feature werrorwvlaextension int arrbsizeb does this mean the autograder does not accept variable length arrays am i not allowed to do this thanks
student,hi if i have a function called function would the following statement be tail recursive return reverse function thanks
student,i cant seem to get negative integers to work on my filter functions everything else works fine anyone else have this issue whilst testing
student,
student,if we wrote sum and product using accumulate and wrote filterodd and filtereven using filter we basically testing filter when we call sum and product and the same for filterodd and filtereven do we still have to write test case for filter and accumulate also are we required to write sum and product using accumulate and write filterodd filter even using filter
student,are we allowed to use listequal in p2cpp or is that only allowed in p2testscpp
student,are we allowed to include recursiveh in our p2tests file
student,7 5 10 8 15 8 why couldnt 8 fit into both of these spots
student,in lab we were told that numbers left of the root are always less than or equal to the roots value and numbers to the right of the root are always greater than the roots value in a previous post there was a tree that did not follow this so could anyone confirm that what we heard in lab is the correct way to display a tree
student,can we add a coveredby function to the library in p2h so we can test it in p2testscpp
student,what are the base cases for inserttree i know that an empty tree is one are there any others
student,if you have a list a 1 2 3 and another list b 4 5 6 and your index to place b in a is larger than as size lets say 5 one index past putting b at the end of a should this return an error or should this be a corner case that returns something else like it just returns 1 2 3 4 5 6 should we assume that all test cases will always give us an inbounds index

student,could someone clear this order up for me 3 4 2 7 8 5 6 would the order be 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 or 8 7 5 6 4 3 2 thank you
student,i was playing around with pointers and tested the following code there was no compiler error but no result when i ran either how is x a different from x a
student,are they necessary or can i just write my test cases under main in p2testcpp
student,in xcode i go to declare a helper function as static int foo int and i have an error that says static declaration of foo follows non static declaration i cant seem to find any resources on the issue on line does any one have any ideas
student,11 8 15 1 9 if given this tree and the element 6 where would one insert the 6 if it cant be inserted what should be returned
student,my partner and i have been testing each function individually but we have not written out a test case code file i know we will lose at least one point on the autograder if we do not include the test case file but will we be penalized further the test case code was taking a long time and our first priority is the project code

student,since ive implemented my own test cases and functions may i get rid of the provided test case within main to clean up my main function
student,this function is troubling me as the nature of this function is a little different from the rest in that there are not explicit edge cases we can test for it either is or it is not and there are countless possibilities that need to be tested its easy enough to test if containedby returns true when necessary but there are far too many possibilities to effectively test for when containedby should return false what would be a sufficient series of tests for this particular function
student,which files do we need to zip together to submit sorry if this has been answered before
student,im having trouble understanding how to approach the tree functions more specifically the sum function i know that were supposed to consider breaking them down into element left and right but could someone go into a bit more detail about that i guess im just confused on how were supposed to keep doing that for each branching pair as the way im envisioning it would have it stuck on one particular chain of left or right most branches thanks in advance
student,i implemented a bunch of functions for project 2 but i want to know if the all work how do i run my program after compiling it because when i do it the normal way i get an error
student,just wonderingbecause we are working on insert first
student,in order to plug in new value the computer has to remember the original tree i have no idea how to create new tree with elt any hint or idea
student,is there office hours going on right now
student,do we have to write rmes for all of our test functions in p2tests
student,i want to create a function to help me streamline testing can i do so where can i put it so that it will not interfere with the grading process will declaring it static in p2tests work
student,i saw already that we arent allowed to include testhelpers in out p2cpp but if there is a function we want to use are we allowed to copy and paste it in our p2cpp for example would i be allowed to use treeequal in my p2cpp as a helper function for coveredby thanks
student,hi im using visual studio i keep getting a lot of errors like undeclared indentifier missing etc is this because im supposed to compile it with caen and the compile command on the caen is able to properly link all the files together how can i build the program locally since vs is what im comfortable programming with in my p2cpp i have include p2h the p2h file includes recursiveh and that includes other files and so on i believe i should only have to include p2h but my p2cpp isnt recognizing listt unless i also include recursiveh in p2h thanks in advance for reference these are the

student,just for the clarification reasons containedby and coveredby do the same thing right in my understanding coveredby is just an optional helper function to containedby is it correct
student,hello everyone ive got some question about function pointer for accumulate it seems like the accumulate function has int fnint int however the earlier sum and product implementations only have list type for the input instead of two int how am i supposed to deal with this thanks
student,some of the list implementations requires n0 i want to use if else clause to split the n0 cases but since the return type of the functions are listt if i put return 0 under else the compiler would say the following recursivelisth in function ‘listt rotatelistt int’ recursivelisth79 error ‘recursivelistrecursivelistconst recursivelistnode’ is private p2cpp130 error within this context make p2tests error 1 what should i do thanks for helping
student,if we want to resubmit to the auto grader do we have to physically delete our previous tar archive or will the terminal command we were given overwrite the file
student,i see project 3 isnt due for quite a while when will it be released approximately when will we have gone over the necessary material to be able to realistically begin tackling the project many thanks
student,i was wondering how to check the functions accumulate and filter do you need to make new functions like sum and product and take in an int instead of a list like the ones we already wrote if so where would we put the declarations and definitions for those new functions
student,lets say that i have the following bit of code listt rotatelistt list int n if n 0 assert0 do rotate things and hypothetically lets say that the autograder calls this function with rotate scarylist 1 the function will assert is this acceptable graceful for the above function
student,i am having some trouble with traversal i keep getting segmentation faults but i am not sure why when i debug using the bt command i get this program received signal sigsegv segmentation fault 0x000000327fe79087 in intmalloc from lib64libcso6 gdb bt 0 0x000000327fe79087 in intmalloc from lib64libcso6 1 0x000000327fe7a6b1 in malloc from lib64libcso6 2 0x00000032872bd0bd in operator newunsigned long from usrlib64libstdcso6 3 0x00000000004060e6 in recursivelistcopynodes this0x7fffffffdd60 copyto0xadd1c8 copyfrom0xadd1c0 at recursivelistcpp110 4 0x0000000000406128 in recursivelistcopynodes this0x7fffffffdd60 copyto0xadd1a8 copyfrom0xadd1a0 at recursivelistcpp111 5 0x0000000000406128 in recursivelistcopynodes this0x7fffffffdd60 copyto0xadd188 copyfrom0xadd180 at recursivelistcpp111 6 0x0000000000406128 in recursivelistcopynodes this0x7fffffffdd60 copyto0xadd168 copyfrom0xadd160 at recursivelistcpp111 7 0x0000000000406128 in recursivelistcopynodes this0x7fffffffdd60 copyto0xadd148 copyfrom0xadd140 at recursivelistcpp111 8 0x0000000000406128 in recursivelistcopynodes this0x7fffffffdd60 copyto0xadd128 copyfrom0xadd120 at recursivelistcpp111 9 0x0000000000406128 in recursivelistcopynodes this0x7fffffffdd60 copyto0xadd108 copyfrom0xadd100 at recursivelistcpp111 10 0x0000000000406128 in recursivelistcopynodes this0x7fffffffdd60 copyto0xadd0e8 copyfrom0xadd0e0 at recursivelistcpp111 11 0x0000000000406128 in recursivelistcopynodes this0x7fffffffdd60 copyto0xadd0c8 copyfrom0xadd0c0 at recursivelistcpp111 12 0x0000000000406128 in recursivelistcopynodes this0x7fffffffdd60 can anybody tell me what the problem is
student,must we use assert in every test case or rather can we just print out the result and check how to use the assert if the result to compare is tree or list if we have to use assert is that mean we should construct the list or tree with the function provided to treat them as the expected one to compare with other results
student,do we need to have rme clauses in our helper functions or is one at each of the main functions enough thanks
student,when we are writing p2 the only functions that need the rme clausesneed to be declared at the top are the helper functions correct and they should have the same rme as the function theyre helping the rest we can just write the implementation of below correct
student,just for clarification if i had the following trees a 2 3 b 4 2 5 3 containedbyab should return true correct
student,when i run make in a g compiler i keep getting the message make treeinserttest error 1 any idea what is wrong
student,so in the p2cpp file there is a hint that states that implies we should use a sorted list to insert the new integer into our tree however from the two examples below i think its safe to say that both trees produce the same list of 6 8 10 in this case how do we know which tree a list should produce should we use lists at all for this function
student,when i submitted my file to the autograder i get that nothing compiles test case results test case filtertest failed to compile filtertest 01 test case p2tests failed to compile p2tests 01 test case simpletest failed to compile simpletest 01 test case treeinserttest failed to compile treeinserttest 01 total score 04 but when i compile on caen linux it works fine i redownloaded the h files and was wondering what else i could try
student,as im going back and cleaning up my code im removing a lot of temporary lists ints etc that i used to make sense of what i was doing and instead placing their contents in the recursive function calls for example something like listt templist appendreversesomelist anotherlist int someint n 1 listt templist2 makelistsomeint listresttemplist return recursivefunctemplist templist2 would become return recursivefuncappendreversesomelist anotherlist makelisttempint listresttemplist i guess in short im wondering if its better style to use several lines of code that are easy to follow or one huge line of function calls that take up less space
student,when looking at the statement void mapintmodifier func int src int dst int length is intmodifier a custom type that we defined to make the statement look cleaner if so isnt it essentially a pointer to a pointer to a function
student,i am stuck on the fold function i have tried many different solutions but just cant seem to get it i would really appreciate if someone could help me better understand it
student,should we consider that we might go over the max value for an int for any of these functions eg if i called product on a list with 100 10000000s and if so how would we cover these cases
student,i know we can do this 1 3 4 by code like this in testcpp treet name treemake1 treemake3 treemake treemake treemake4 treemake treemake but can we do this 1 3 4 if so what should i include i tried treet middle treemake134 and this treet middle treemake1 treemake3 treemake4 but it wont compile so is there a way to do that
student,if we use covered as a helper function does it have to be recursive as well or can we call functions we have already written
student,when i tried to copy some of my code into labster and check its recursitivity it shows that this function is vacuously tail recursive is that ok for proj 2 does it fill into the tail recursive category also i get another popup shows that xxx function is the only sort of tail recursive the problem is that it calls a function thats not tail recursive is that ok for proj 2 thanks
student,how large should we test for the fib functions should i assume that since they return ints and not longs we are only required to test for inputs that will be considered ints to be more specific the 47th fibonacci number is 11 digits long will testing up to the 46th be sufficient
student,how many test cases should we put for each function we did one basic one for each that covered corner cases and we could add more for stress cases and whatnot is this necessary though because it will take us a very long time
student,is it possible for trees to reconnect later down in their path for instance can there be a tree as follows 1 2 3 4
student,if we had a function like so int fooint a int fnint if a0 return a return foofna fn where we have a function pointer as a type and we need to call that function as a parameter for the main recursive call is this still considered tail recursive labster says its not
student,does anyone know why this is happening p2testscpp runs in xcode and i transfer it over to caen linux to check if it compiles and then put it in the submittargz file is there anything else i need to do i see something on the spec about make test but i am not sure what that is or how to do that could that be what is causing it to fail to compile
student,what does the filer function do i read the rme clause and still dont understand can someone give an example of input and expected output thanks
student,i must be missing something because im not understanding how there can only be one spot for an inserted number to fit into a sorted binary tree like for the example given in the spec with the 4253 tree tried to copypaste it here but formatting got screwed up they insert the 1 on the left branch of the 2 but why for example could the 1 not also be inserted on the left branch of the 5 this would violate this portion of the spec there is only one unique location for any element to be inserted
student,in the function insert tree will the autograder be testing for out of case numbers for example the largest number in the tree is 5 and the elt input into the function is 9 would this go next to the 5 or would it not go into the tree at all
student,ive read the other posts about submitting to the autograder but i cant seem to figure out what my problem is test case results test case p2tests failed to compile p2tests 01 treeinserttest 11 simpletest 11 filtertest 11 total score 34 i do not have any cpp included in p2testscpp only p2h any ideas i have no errors when i run make test either
student,the is isprime function provided as a sample test treats 1 as a prime number can we still use it to test
student,can we call functions such as reverse or append in later functions
student,is the following tail recursive int functionalist int ifconditionstatement return functionalist int else ifconditionstatement return functionalist int code isnt actually what i use its just extremely rough pseudocode just wondering if a return statement in an else if is considered computation after the recursive steps
student,what does the append function do can someone give an example of input and expected output thanks
student,for containedby to evaluate to true do both trees need to be full does 5 5 or 5 5 1 1
student,when we write helper functions are we supposed to declare them in p2h and implement them in p2cpp or just implement them in p2cpp i saw in one post that we are not supposed to edit p2h at all
student,could someone provide a hint about how to get started with these i have something at least printing for inserttree but i dont even know what is considered to be correct for example if you want to insert 5 into the 2 examples given in the spec where would it go any help or guidance would be appreciated
student,is it considered bad style to declare new variables in recursive functions for instance i found it helpful to add extra boolean variables and initialize them to false in the containedby function if this creates a properlyworking functions is it okay to use this method
student,in the prompt it tells that the fibonacci function computes the nth fibonacci number then t gives examples of fib0 0 fib1 1 fibn fibn1 fibn2 this would give us 0 1 1 2 3 5 as the first 6 fibonacci numbers my question is is fibn treated as the nth fibonacci number for this project because fib5 would return 5 but 3 is the 5th fibonacci number does the numbering of fibonacci numbers start at 0 like vectors
student,i figured out how to determine where to insert elt but i still dont know how i could insert elt to the specific place i guess i will have to use treemake but its parameter is inttreetree i am very confused
student,i have a question with regards to the last intro to tree slides heres the code from the last lecture slide void treefunctiontreet tree if treeisemptytree return cout treeelttree treefunctiontreelefttree treefunctiontreerighttree my question is why will the part treefunctiontreerighttree get executed as we keep treelefting the tree the tree will become empty and thus return when we return doesnt the stack get eliminated how come the last line is able to execute
student,is there any other autograder report card we can see besides the 4 points this project is worth much more than 4 pointsi guess my question is if i get a 44 will i get a perfect score if i have good style too
student,can we assume that all lists that we are given are wellformed lists
student,for my traversal function it correctly traverses the tree as i have been able to test by printing the element i am trying to add to the list but my list is not adding all the elements im not sure but i think this is because when it works backwards through the stack the list i am saving to goes back to what its value was at the point when it was originally called what is the best way to get around this problem thanks
student,once you go to the left from top to calculate the right do you have to go back to the top and do right again can someone explain the logic
student,a question about array as function variable when a function take an array as input variable is it automatically passing by reference
student,if 3 is added to the top tree would the bottom tree be the correct result
student,i am having problems with this test case tree a 2 1 2 3 tree b 2 3 my function returns that tree b is not contained by tree a because when it sees that the topmost elements of the trees are equal it sends it to the the covered helper function when the covered function compares the element of the right subtree of tree b which is 3 to the element of the right subtree of tree a which is 2 again it returns false how should i fix this problem
student,is it ok if i use stdvector in p2testscpp but not in p2cpp obviously to make it easier to construct testing lists
student,what exactly qualifies as an empty tree say i have the following tree 4 2 5 3 does 3 qualify as empty or does empty mean totally empty like one of the branches of 3 i hope this makes sense
student,are we allowed to create a helper function for filter should accumulate when passing it a multiply function and product function return 0 if there is a 0 in the list
student,can a list ever be covered but not contained within another list
student,for the first few functions we can easily use the assert command to generate errors when the test case fails since the functions return int however im not sure how to test for errors when a list is returned other than manually couting the expected list as a string eg 4 3 2 1 and then seeing if my output for that function matches is there another way that im missing that can assert or compare an output list to a prestored variable i know that i can try to make a new list for assert but in the case of append where the list can have no pattern 4 5 6 7 99 88 77 66 for example im not sure how to generate that list manually or is it okay that our program does not return an error even if the lists are not correct because i have no idea how the program is supposed to assert an output list to an expected list if i cant create the expected list beforehand
student,should the test case functions be written in p2cpp and called by main in p2testcpp or should we put the test functions below main in p2testcpp
student,if we have a loop or if statement containing only 1 line of code is it necessary to used curly braces or is it acceptable to omit them
student,can i have two base cases in my recursive functions ie if n 0 return 0 if n 0 return 1 rest of code
student,when i type in the command to download the file it gives me this error i think ive typed in exactly what was written in the spec sheet so im not sure why im getting this error can someone help me out
student,is it ok if i use the concat and gcd functions from lab 3 to test my accumulate function in project 2
student,in this example would 10 be considered the left most element or 4 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 10 11
student,im confused by the containedby function if tree a is just 3 as the elt with two empty leaves then would it be considered contained by b if b 4 2 1 3
student,i was trying to compile my code but there is something wrong with my treesum function the compiler says conversion from treet to nonscalar type listt requested do i need to convert the elements into a list first
student,if the user enters a tree that is not a sorted binary tree should the program display an error message or should we assume that the user will always enter a sorted binary tree thank you
student,after testing accumulate in the test file when i try to assign fn to the new bool function in order to test filter it gives me an error saying that fn cant be reassigned to a function with different parameters when i comment out the initial assignation of fn to the int parameters for accumulate the bool one works fine i dont really see a way to test both pointer functions in one compilation of the test file is this a problem for the autograder grading in general
student,if you are trying to insert an elt into a tree that already contains that elt should it be placed to the left or right of the original
student,im trying to run the command to create a zip file but do not know what the grouptxt file is nor where i can access it could someone point me in the right direction as to getting this file so i can create a zip file that i can submit
student,hi i think i have correctly written the accumulate function tail recursively but im not really sure what this means otherwise return the tail recursive equivalent of fnlistfirstlist accumulatelistrestlist fn identity can someone clarify is that just saying we have to write code that accomplishes that particular fn call only tall recursively because that call is not tail recursive
student,ok im misunderstanding something very fundamental in accumulate there is a pointer to a function that takes two parameters of type int right then how do we use sumproduct with it because those functions only take one parameter of type listt
student,for this test tree 4 5 3 6 7 8 2 5 1 would the correct traversal output be 6 2 5 7 4 5 8 1 3
student,i might have missed this but if we write helper functions for the test cases as suggested should they be static like the helper functions in p2 or does it not matter for p2tests thanks
student,is there a prelab3 survey because i cant find it if there is one could you also tell me where the post lab survey is too
student,when i run make test my compiler never enters the main function of p2testscpp i am unable to reach any of my test cases in order to test the functions i have implemented why doesnt make test ever reach p2testcpp
student,how do you print out a list so you can read it in the terminal i see in the project description that there is a function listprint however it returns a bunch of errors when i attempt to compile currently i am trying to do something along the lines of without quotations cout listprintlist endl where list is of type listt the main error i get is without quotations mismatched types ‘const stdbasicstringchart traits alloc’ and ‘void’ am i using listprint incorrectly if so how are you supposed to use it
student,my map func for lab 3 is only 4 lines since i used a loop with task 2 fold being optional and getting the right output its pretty shortjust wanted to ask if the map func is supposed to be that short or if im missing something
student,im having a bit of trouble with traversal i have found a way to access each element in order and to print them with cout but i am having trouble putting them in a list in order when i put a listmake statement where the cout is it has trouble since each stack can only see its own so it never makes a complete list can anyone point me to how i could get them all the go into the same list
student,hi i was wondering if the p2 test file is going to be graded for style also do the variables that we use within the test cases in p2 tests have to have names that make sense this might sound strange but when we were writing our test cases we made the names pretty arbitrarily or using acronyms that dont make much sense to others is this okay or should we go back and change everything finally must we use assert or treelist equal in all of our test cases or is it okay if we just printed expectedactual and saw based off that if it was correct thanks
student,lets say we have two functions function1 and function2 where function1 is tailrecursive if you call function1 inside the recursive call to function2 is function2 not tailrecursive for example int function1int a int b int function2int c int d if return c else return function2function1c d d is function2 not tailrecursive i hope this was clear thanks
student,i am trying to write the traversal function and i would like to know if the tree to the left is empty and then if it is add the element im on to a list but the treeisempty function checks if both sides are empty and the treeleft function requires that that tree is not empty so is there anyway to just check if one specific side is empty or not thanks
student,can we do tail recursive for insert tree function i can do a recursive but didnt figure out a way for the tailed one basically didnt figure out a way to store a larger tree in tail recursive since the only operation on tree type is for the most top number
student,outside of p2testcpp my partner and i have tested a significant amount of test cases per function in order to assure that all edge cases are covered how many of these test cases are you looking for in p2testscpp we can add them all but the spec says you must have at least one test per function this makes me believe that we should not include all of the test cases that we wrote what will get us maximum points for the test portion of our grade thanks for your help in advance
student,are we allowed to use treeequal in p2cpp or only in p2testscpp
student,so i tried to check the code i wrote so far and submitted the tar file on the autograder i made the tar file using make tar command as told in the project specifics when i open up submittargz on caen linux p2cpp and grouptxt are in there did anyone have this issue before how would i solve this issue thank you
student,when i run my project i get this error message i am using the p2testscpp file to test my reverse and append function i am confused because it should only test lista and listb but the results are showing else as otherwise what does this mean bash41 make test g wall werror pedantic o2 filtertestcpp p2cpp recursivelistcpp binarytreecpp recursivecpp testhelperscpp o filtertest g wall werror pedantic o2 simpletestcpp p2cpp recursivelistcpp binarytreecpp recursivecpp testhelperscpp o simpletest g wall werror pedantic o2 treeinserttestcpp p2cpp recursivelistcpp binarytreecpp recursivecpp testhelperscpp o treeinserttest g wall werror pedantic o2 p2testscpp p2cpp recursivelistcpp binarytreecpp recursivecpp testhelperscpp o p2tests simpletest simpletestout diff simpletestout simpletestoutcorrect filtertest 3 20 46 43 9 17 103 102 3 43 17 103 failed make test error 255
student,if there is no left subtree in extree does that mean treeleftextree is an empty tree
student,my partner and i have figured out how to determine the location for inserting elt into the tree but we cant seem to get the tree to attach our test returns simply the tree created by the elt with both children empty how can we recurse back up the tree and make the elt attach as a child to a tree further up
student,in the accumulate function does the identity determine what operation is performed
student,when i try running the p2testscpp command in caen terminal i get the following message bash p2testscpp permission denied i can run the command p2tests but i cannot edit this file if i use the command gedit p2testscaen says i dont have access to edit the file anyway i can edit p2tests or run p2testscpp
student,if a list has negative numbers and gets passed to the filterodd or filtereven functions should a number like 2 be considered even how should we handle such a situation
student,should chop be able to handle n values that are larger than the number of elements in the list i am testing the case where list 1 2 3 4 5 6 and n 10 but my assert statement fails saying terminating with uncaught exception of type listexception error empty list thanks
student,can we use forwhile loops in our tests to make lists
student,lets say a requires clause says n is positive should we not worry that our function does not have an output if a negative n is entered
student,test case results test case p2tests failed to compile p2tests 01 test case treeinserttest failed to compile treeinserttest 01 test case simpletest failed to compile simpletest 01 test case filtertest failed to compile filtertest 01 i scp r exported my entire p2 folder to my caen alias sshed into caen then compiled each of the test files that have a main function and each one runs in my terminal just like it does in xcode no errors using the g wall werror pedantic method they run perfect through caen why do they not run with the auto grader also adding to this the tar that i submit to the auto grader only includes p2cpp and p2testscpp and grouptxt how would these other files that im not even expected to turn in not compile and why dont i turn in p2h if i had to declare helper functions that are used in p2cpp
student,is it acceptable to arbitrarily pick values to pass to the helper functions by this i mean for instance to pass 1 for a counter variable and 0 for a variable that helps with calculations is this considered badillegal style
student,are we supposed to be using recursion for the implementation of fold
student,whenever i compile the test cases i get tons of undefined reference errors in the test files that we arent even supposed to manipulate i dont know how to fix this
student,is it possible to write the map and fold functions in one or two lines i just want to make sure im not completely missing something here thanks
student,are we allowed to call a function we wrote for the assignment in another function for example if my append function appends the lists but does so in reverse order can i then call my reverse function within the append function so it will return the new list in the correct order
student,my project compiles perfectly fine and runs in xcode and im just adding test cases as i go to p2tests i just finished my last function inserttree but im not done with my testing i have not added anything to the other testing files only to p2testscpp when i submit to the auto grader i get test case results test case treeinserttest failed to compile treeinserttest 01 test case p2tests failed to compile p2tests 01 test case filtertest failed to compile filtertest 01 test case simpletest failed to compile simpletest 01 total score 04
student,for the sake of better readability i put all my test functions in another separate cpp file and call them in the main function of p2testcpp i would have to include them in the tar file for submission are we allowed to do this if so is there a command to do this
student,in the rotate function can n be greater than the number of elements in the list thanks
student,i know how to test some of the tests cases that are available to us by default but i dont get how to make test cases for some of the list functions such as accumulate or sum are we supposed to make out own test case function to test accumulate or is there a given test function to use also how can we make complicated listst such as 2456323467812 to test our function
student,would we ever be responsible say on an exam for being able to decrypt something like int wtfintint 3intint 5 or will we only have to know the basic syntax as far as int myfuncptrint main reason im asking is because the lab this week has a weird declaration like that in it though not quite that extreme obviously on a separate note does anyone know what syntaxgrammar rules require that it be this int blahint intint name params ret type on the outside rather than this which is what normal function pointer declarations look like int int blahint int ret type name params the second one works if you write typedef int intfuncint intfunc blahint int but not if you try to do it without a typedef
student,do we have to preserve the order of implementation in p2cpp for example filterodd and filtereven are before filter but by implementing filter first i can use it in the implementation of filterodd and filtereven is this allowed
student,so i tried to compile in the linux vnc terminal but this came up i am planning on going to office hours but maybe someone else had this same issue thanks bash41 make g wall werror pedantic o2 filtertestcpp p2cpp recursivelistcpp binarytreecpp recursivecpp testhelperscpp o filtertest in file included from usrumgcc482includec482array350 from p2cpp24 usrumgcc482includec482bitsc0xwarningh322 error error this file requires compiler and library support for the iso c 2011 standard this support is currently experimental and must be enabled with the stdc11 or stdgnu11 compiler options error this file requires compiler and library support for the make filtertest error 1

student,are we allowed to add testhelpersh to p2cpp i want to compare lists and i know theres a function in testhelpersh for it
student,are we allowed to make a helper function with this case
student,the requires clause for lab03 states that src points to an array of size length should it say that src points to an array of size length
student,can we use the functions traversal and sum in the treesum function because all it would take is using traversal and then summing the list which isnt in and of itself recursive but it uses two recursive functions
student,ironically i was able to figure out fibtail before i did normal fib for some reason im having a hard time writing a recursive function that is not tailrecursive how can i change the tail function to just be normal recursive
student,hello all when trying to compile my code for debugging i get an error that says undefined reference to recursivelistrecursivelist does anybody know what causes this andor how to fix it thank you for your help in advance
student,are we allowed to use helper functions for fib and fibtail
student,im trying to test the append function and id like to test to see if two lists with identical elements are still being included in the appended list but for the expected list is there a way to hard code values into a list you create ie an alternate way to putting elements in aside from a for loop thanks
student,while testing traversal i continue to get the output of segmentation fault what could be causing this my test for traversal has the tree being printed out then i create a list and assign it the value of traversal tree and then print out that list
student,after much troubleshooting myself i have come to a standstill i have a part of the code that is modeled as such changed a bit but the same concept as my lab code int a int b a intmodifierb it was my understanding that when calling the function for void and you pass is say the triple function it would look as such int a int b a tripleb i could be understanding this wrong and could be my error but when trying to compile im getting an error that is telling me basically which im reading as the function pointer is not a compatible type to the integer input im trying to give it from the array to edit any suggestions on how to proceed from here
student,there are no compilation errors present in my p2cpp which is so far the only code i have been editing however i have three errors from other files or perhaps this one i dont know of that are keeping me from compiling and testing they are undefined symbols for architecture x8664 inserttreeint binarytree referenced from main in treeinserttesto filterrecursivelist bool int referenced from main in filtertesto ld symbols not found for architecture x8664 clang error linker command failed with exit code 1 use v to see invocation any pointers as to whats going wrong
student,could someone provide a hint on how to do these super confused about where to even start and how to be able to detect where the nth element in a list appears thank you
student,since they are already provided do we need to write our own test function for filter and treeinsert
student,i am attempting to run my code in visual studios and when i do i get an error for all of my stub functions using assertfalse saying they must return a value any idea what is happening
student,in lecture prof deorio mentioned stress testing with very large lists for project 2 aside from making an array is there a more efficient way to make a very large list to be used in the test function
student,are we allowed to use loop in task1 or is it still recursion only
student,do we need to test extremely large numbers in our input ie computing the product of a 500element list containing numbers going up to 500 if so how do we compute these results given storage size limits for variable types like int is there a different type of variable we should use
student,are we allowed to use fib which is written recursively in fibtail function
student,were we supposed to receive another email with the prelab and postlab surveys for this next lab or are they somewhere on ctools
student,building off of 302 im also having difficulty compiling in xcode and removed some of the cpp files from compiling in the build settings p2testscpp is causing the following error when i remove that source from the build settings the build succeeds when it is added the build fails is there something that i need to change in the file or in xcodes settings the file is unchanged from the version posted on the google drive thanks
student,in the specs for the containedby function one part of it says if a is contained by either of bs subtrees i understand what it means to be covered but i am not sure what it means to be contained
student,can anyone give any insight on what im doing wrong what i might be missing etc thanks
student,i am super confused about trees take tree sum for example how do you go about this when there is no function called treerest similar to lists where you can return the rest of the tree the only element that it appears you can pull out is the very first one which also confuses me on how to do sum and the rest of them can anyone provide some clarification or some guidance on how to do sum this took me forever with lists too but once i understood how to make a sum list i knew how to do almost all the other ones
student,i dont quite get what the function is supposed to do if tree a is 4 2 5 3 and b is 3 would that count as a being covered by b thank you
student,when learning about function pointers the lecture had all the helper function take functions as parameters in other words the helper functions all had function pointers my question is is the accumulate function that we need to write a helper function
student,i submitted my tar file to the autograder and i wanted a little clarification on how the grading breakdown was working i saw a list of the four test files filter p2 simple and treeinsert so what we see from the autograder is just whether they compile for p2s case or whether the outputs are correct for the other three right
student,do we need to keep all the rmes in p2cpp except those for the helper functions i know it doesnt hurt to keep them but its just really messy and those are in p2h already
student,if not will we get marked down if we do have a helper function for every tail recursive function
student,are we allowed to use global variables in p2testscpp to declare general testing lists trees ie listt zerotofour listmake for int i 4 i 0 i zerotofour listmakei zerotofour and we can use zerotofour in any of our test cases
student,so according to the spec for example inserting 1 into the tree 4 2 5 3 would yield 4 2 5 1 3 what if you had tried to insert an element of 2 would it just return a copy of the original tree since there is not a place to put it and what would the tree look like if you called inserttree7 tree inserttree8 tree inserttree6 tree in that order
student,when writing the traverse function once you store one element the leftmost element how do you go backwards basically delete the branch we just evaluated to continue working with the rest of the tree like in lists we had the listrest function which allowed us to delete elements off the list is there something similar we can do with trees
student,a lot of error messages pop up when i try to compile my code i have tried the following code from a lecture slide and am bombarded with undefined reference to recursivelistrecursivelist warnings i did not add assert statements for each function is this the cause of the compilation errors
student,
student,are there surveys to complete for lab 03 this week
student,does listrestexamplelist return an empty set if examplelist has only 1 element
student,i have all my header files open but i keep getting this when i run p2testscpp
student,when we need to compare two lists to see if theyre equal do we have to use listequal or can we just print the list to see if the result is what we expected
student,are we going to need to set up multiple loops to create an appended function test i want to use assert to compare the results
student,if you use two empty lists for the input to the append fcn the output should be another empty list right
student,i am running the test checking if treea 4 3 is contained by treeb 2 1 4 2 3 2 should this evaluate to true or false
student,i know the list functions are supposed to be 10 lines or shorter but are the tree functions allowed to be longer
student,what should the behavior of the function be if n is greater than the number of elements in the list should it act as if n the number of elements in the list continue rotating even after a complete revolution throw an error
student,for the purpose of the function pointer recursive functions should we assume the values of the identity inputed by the instructor test cases will be correct or should we check the identity value against the effect of the inputed pointer function to ensure that it is correct
student,will there be values that will cause an int overflow in the tests should we use longs instead of ints
student,are we allowed to split our test cases into separate void functions to organize p2tests and then we call them all in main
student,im trying to compile on caen using ssh but it wont compile even though the files are obviously in the right directory what am i doing wrong
student,im having some trouble with the listsequallistt listt function the compiler says that listsequal was not declared in the scope but i have included the testhelpersh file any ideas
student,my compiler is extremely messed up for some reason and i have no idea what to do at this point command line tools and hpc are installed already i am working on a mac running yosemite 1010
student,when i try to compile my code so far using make test i receive the following error in function main filtertestcpptext0x211 undefined reference to filterrecursivelist bool int collect2 ld returned 1 exit status make filtertest error 1 any ideas why this might be happening
student,even when i take all my own content out of the p2testscpp file when i try to compile it the compiler says undefined reference to listmake p2h is included at the top of the file is there something else i need to include as well
student,whenever i try to make a test i keep getting an error and it wont work can anyone help me out this is what my terminal command line looks like 587216367project2 jacobmyers make test g wall werror pedantic o2 filtertestcpp p2cpp recursivelistcpp binarytreecpp recursivecpp testhelperscpp o filtertest couldnt understand kernosversion 1400 recursivelistcpp in instantiation of ‘stdbasicostreamchart traits stdoperatorstdbasicostreamchart traits const stdbasicstringchart traits alloc with chart char traits stdchartraitschar alloc stdallocatorchar’ recursivelistcpp87 instantiated from here recursivelistcpp87 error explicit instantiation of ‘stdbasicostreamchart traits stdoperatorstdbasicostreamchart traits const stdbasicstringchart traits alloc with chart char traits stdchartraitschar alloc stdallocatorchar’ but no definition available recursivelistcpp in instantiation of ‘stdbasicostreamchart traits stdoperatorstdbasicostreamchart traits const stdbasicstringchart traits alloc with chart char traits stdchartraitschar alloc stdallocatorchar’ recursivelistcpp87 instantiated from here recursivelistcpp87 error explicit instantiation of ‘stdbasicostreamchart traits stdoperatorstdbasicostreamchart traits const stdbasicstringchart traits alloc with chart char traits stdchartraitschar alloc stdallocatorchar’ but no definition available recursivelistcpp in instantiation of ‘stdbasicostreamchart traits stdoperatorstdbasicostreamchart traits const stdbasicstringchart traits alloc with chart char traits stdchartraitschar alloc stdallocatorchar’ recursivelistcpp87 instantiated from here recursivelistcpp87 error explicit instantiation of ‘stdbasicostreamchart traits stdoperatorstdbasicostreamchart traits const stdbasicstringchart traits alloc with chart char traits stdchartraitschar alloc stdallocatorchar’ but no definition available binarytreecpp in instantiation of ‘stdbasicostreamchart traits stdoperatorstdbasicostreamchart traits const stdbasicstringchart traits alloc with chart char traits stdchartraitschar alloc stdallocatorchar’ binarytreecpp298 instantiated from here binarytreecpp298 error explicit instantiation of ‘stdbasicostreamchart traits stdoperatorstdbasicostreamchart traits const stdbasicstringchart traits alloc with chart char traits stdchartraitschar alloc stdallocatorchar’ but no definition available binarytreecpp in instantiation of ‘stdbasicostreamchart traits stdoperatorstdbasicostreamchart traits const stdbasicstringchart traits alloc with chart char traits stdchartraitschar alloc stdallocatorchar’ binarytreecpp298 instantiated from here binarytreecpp298 error explicit instantiation of ‘stdbasicostreamchart traits stdoperatorstdbasicostreamchart traits const stdbasicstringchart traits alloc with chart char traits stdchartraitschar alloc stdallocatorchar’ but no definition available binarytreecpp in instantiation of ‘stdbasicostreamchart traits stdoperatorstdbasicostreamchart traits const stdbasicstringchart traits alloc with chart char traits stdchartraitschar alloc stdallocatorchar’ binarytreecpp298 instantiated from here binarytreecpp298 error explicit instantiation of ‘stdbasicostreamchart traits stdoperatorstdbasicostreamchart traits const stdbasicstringchart traits alloc with chart char traits stdchartraitschar alloc stdallocatorchar’ but no definition available make filtertest error 1
student,can we use loops in our test functions
student,if we have a helper function that is tail recursive but our original function does not use recursion only this helper function is this legal for instance we are calling a recursive helper function as the second line in a required function the list this helper returns is operated on later in the function before being returned by the final function is this still tailrecursivepermitted for project 2
student,if we write a helper function that modifies the list is is passed locally within the helper function do we need a modifies comment for it
student,do i have to edit p2testscpp to test the sum function
student,do we need to make rem comments on helper functions
student,do we submit the file with all of our test cases along with our file of functions for grading
student,do we have to submit the exact same code as our partner
student,i am looking to make my own tree to test it and sort of play around but for treemake function it just seems to call the branches is there a way to make your own tree like we used for loops to make lists in the simplecasescpp
student,in the base case conditional ie if num 0 is it okay to have additional work before the return ie calling a function to put together a list or is it necessary to have the list complete and ready to return by the time it reaches the base case
student,can we include all of the header files in p2cpp should we
student,i have a question about groups my teammates and i decide to work on the project separately so that we both can practice more however we would like to share our test cases so that the bugs are easier to find is it ok that our code in functions differs but the code in test cases is the same which means our code are not totally the same
student,i have read the spec several times and made notes but i still do not know where andor how to start i downloaded the p2targz and extracted it into my caen files when i try to compile it using the command line prompt given in the spec i am told there is no such file or directory for p2testscpp and recursivecpp how do i start this project should i just go function by function writing a test case in p2testscpp and then the actual function in p2cpp if so how can i compile to check if my code is working
student,this may seem like a silly question but just to clarify are negative numbers considered even and odd or not different math teachers teach it in different ways so i was just wondering whether we should include negative numbers in the list when filter odd and filter even is called
student,does tail recursion require only that a call to oneself is the final thing executed in the function for example lets say that i have three functions a b and c when i call a it calls b and then returns a call to itself as the last thing when i call b it calls c and then returns a call to itself as the last thing when i call c it does not call any other functions and then returns a call to itself as the last thing ive attached a gibberish code example of what im talking about i m just wondering if this is tail recursion because there are recursive calls embedded within recursive calls but the recursive call to a function from within that same function is always the last thing clearly in the above gibberish example c is tail recursive but are a and b thanks
student,can you specify what you mean by putting each test case in a function for p2testscpp should we write each test case as a function and put the implementation of that function in a different file and then just call the function in p2tests thanks
student,when i try to compile my files with make test i receive the error p2testscpp in function ‘int main’ p2testscpp43 error ‘list’ was not declared in this scope make p2tests error 1 im having trouble finding the error in my code i have included p2h recursiveh and testhelpersh in my p2testscpp file and declared test functions above main with their definitions below main
student,im trying to figure out if this is tail recursive or not i dont think so but if someone could clarify that would be cool its some random example and doesnt make sense int fooint x int y return barexamplex y foox y im unsure whether tail recursive means the last thing called is the same function or if you can call another function on return
student,i dont really understand what format to follow with writing test cases im guessing we have to write them within the main function in p2testscpp not really sure where to start
student,i am trying to just compile the function stubs and when i try to run the make test command i get the following error for every listt method error unknown type name listt did you mean wintt does anyone have any idea how to fix this im using terminal through mac osx and have never had compilation issues like this before
student,do all of the functions we write have to be explicitly recursive as in can one of our functions simply call another and return that value never actually calling itself
student,stuck on how to write thesedo you need to use anything else besides listfirst and listrest could someone provide some guidance or a hint on how to write these
student,i just wanted to make sure of something for the accumulate function if we passed in a function multiply int x int y that returns the multiple of x and y using an identity of 0 would we always expect a return value of 0 or would we expect the function to return the multiplication of the values in the list to better illustrate would list 4 3 2 1 accumulate list multiply 0 24 or accumulatelist multiply 0 0
student,my partner and i tried stubbing the inserttree function by solely returning tree and then later by solely returning elt however that didnt work how should we go about stubbing for this situation
student,i began writing tests for my functions in p2testscpp but whenever i try to run the tests with p2tests it comes up with the error terminate called after throwing an instance of listexception what error empty list im not sure what this means
student,i guess this question could be in general as well but are we allowed to use arrays for the fibtail function
student,i thought of a function that would require knowing the length of a given list theres no such function included in recursiveh or recursivecpp but i was going to write one in my p2cpp file i couldnt find anything disallowing me to do so in the project spec but i just wanted to make sure that this would be fine to use im not sure if the instructors would prefer me to use a different method of solving the problems than one that uses the length of a list
student,im trying to test my functions by typing in make p2testscpp but the only message i get in return is nothing to be done for p2testscpp not sure why this is happening ive stubbed all the functions and im pretty sure ive included the necessary files in p2cpp why might this be happening thanks
student,in terms of writing tests for all of the functions is it possible to overtest i guess its better to ask if we will be penalized for having too many tests thanks
student,im not sure if this is a question to which i missed a previous answer so apologies in advance if this is a repeat do we need prototypes and rmes for all of the functions that we write including our static helper functions and test functionstest function managers thanks
student,i can find four past exams in the google drive but i cannot find solutions for them have solutions be posted already or we can access solutions from somewhere else
student,im a bit confused about how exactly were supposed to test the accumulate function do we have to write an add and multiply function or else how would we do it
student,can someone please tell me what does control reaches end of nonvoid function mean
student,if i understand correctly we need to make all numbers we use in the test file other places constant so this means when declaring an array the size needs to be constant right and for constants like these do they need to be declared at the top of the file or within individual functions just asking because i would have a lot of constants in my test file
student,in treeinsertcpp we have the statement treet candidate inserttree3 start which works just as intended when i run it however if i were to insert an element into candidate after the above statement say treet candidate inserttree3 start candidate inserttree2 candidate i get an error saying libcabidylib terminating with uncaught exception of type treeexception error tree empty make test abort trap 6 after running make test again im on os x if that may make a difference does anyone else get such an error with the above code or could give me some pointers no pun intended as to why this is may be happening
student,in attempting to streamline my debugging i wrote a function that converts arrays to lists i did this using a loop and sizeofarraysizeoffirselem i noticed that sizeofarraysizeoffirselem doesnt seem to give me the true size of the arrays i am passing to the function for instance i passed a 5element array and the function states that the array is only a 2value array is this an unreliable method to convert arrays to lists or is there something obviously wrong with my methods given the problems above
student,for tail recursive functions is it permissible to modify the final return once the function reaches its base case in my case i need to reverse the final list im returning
student,when i try to make a test for my sum function this keeps popping up for some reason it seems my p2cpp file isnt talking to my tests file im not sure why
student,i get the chunk of text below whenever i enter make test into my terminal it seems that filtertestcpp is replacing p2testscpp i havent altered filtertestcpp from the original g wall werror pedantic o2 filtertestcpp p2cpp recursivelistcpp binarytreecpp recursivecpp testhelperscpp o filtertest undefined symbols for architecture x8664 main referenced from implicit entrystart for main executable ld symbols not found for architecture x8664 clang error linker command failed with exit code 1 use v to see invocation make filtertest error 1 does this have something to do with the multiple main functions we have in the group of files we were given
student,i dont understand what this output is when i run make test in the terminal it goes through simpletestcpp which tests the reverse and append function but i want it to begin testing my functions in the p2testscpp file it just says this g wall werror pedantic o2 p2testscpp p2cpp recursivelistcpp binarytreecpp recursivecpp testhelperscpp o p2tests simpletest simpletestout diff simpletestout simpletestoutcorrect 34c34 1 1 11 12 13 14 15 5 4 3 2 1 1 2 3 4 5 11 12 13 14 15 make test error 1 the lists are the simpleoutcpp test but then it says error 1 i didnt alter p2testscpp at all and i just want it to run to use the free test case given whats going on
student,do we go to the left and add it or to the right or just not add it because it already exists within the tree
student,if both trees are empty should we return true that treea is contained by treeb or should the function return false also if treea is empty and treeb is not is treea considered contained by treeb thanks
student,is there a way to make a tree iterativelyrecursively using treemake the only way i could figure out to make a tree was to make 2 empty trees and then build on them working up from the bottom of the tree to the node this will take a while though and i was hoping for a more efficient way to do it thanks
student,im trying to do listt lst 2 3 4 but it keeps giving an error so im a little confused on how to make a list
student,in testing lists is it possible to use assert the operator doesnt seem to have been overloaded for lists would it be best to just output the expected list and the actual list and compare the two manually
student,there is some of p2s spec that im not fully understand 1 what does product do what it means by returns the product of each element 2 what is identity in the accumulate function and what does fn do and i really dont know what accumulate is supposed to do 3 and for append is it just simply combine 2 lists into 1
student,so if fn were defined to be the sum of its two inputs then accumulate would return the sum of every element in the list plus identity and if fn were defined to be the product of its two inputs then accumulate would return the product of every element in the list times identity from another piazza post i understand function pointers so would using accumulate with an fn sum of two ints on a list 3 2 1 with identity 2 be 3 2 1 2 8 or 3 2 2 2 1 2 12
student,can we use multiple files for our test cases or is it ok to have a file that is upwards of 1000 lines of code right now i am printing everything so that number may be a little high but it is still up there
student,in one of the files it suggests that you make a function for every test case but i am not sure what they mean by that can someone please explain
student,is this file just for our own use or should we be putting our filter test functions in there or just follow that format
student,is it legal to use a counter variable as a base case in a tail recursive function ie have a function that starts at 0 and then the base case is when it equal the integer in the parameter of the given function
student,i am making my test lists right now but i am having trouble making the second list to compare it with for some of my edge cases right now i have made all the lists and i am just printing everything out and checking it by hand but i have no clue how to build a bench mark list for some of my more complicated test cases especially from functions such as rotate and insert where i am putting numbers in out of order should i try to make my test cases so all of the answers are easy or is there some way to overload a list thanks
student,i completed and submitted lab 02 at around 330 pm on friday but forget to submit the post lab survey until after the labs due date of 1155 will i still receive full credit for the lab material i submitted or will my late response on the survey alter my grade
student,i submitted my zip file to the autograder just now and got the following message test case results test case filtertest failed to compile filtertest 01 test case p2tests failed to compile p2tests 01 test case simpletest failed to compile simpletest 01 test case treeinserttest failed to compile treeinserttest 01 total score 04 the only tests that weve written were in p2tests but i cant figure out why it wouldnt have compiled when i made the zip file i was using a mac and used the command tar czf submittargz p2cpp p2testscpp grouptxt is this the correct way to go about this why would it have an error like this
student,i know there was a post regarding using vectors in helper functions for p2cpp but can we atleast use them in the test file to make testing our code easier taking vector values and converting them into lists that we can test our code against since the list class doesnt have a constructor
student,for hailstone should we have commas in between each number or is just a space ok
student,i think im getting these definitions mixed up so to clarify effects returns true if a is covered by b or if a is contained by either of bs subtrees if a and b 4 4 2 5 2 5 3 1 3 if using the func containedbyab it would return true correct cause all of a is inside b and trees like 5 2 3 1 would return false but 4 would return true
student,im a little stuck on what the base case would be any tips
student,hey guys if you want to get a bit ahead heres a really nice explanation of function pointers and how to use them they come in handy for writing the accumulate function in which a function is passed in as an argument
student,i like to write functions where the last else statement in a conditional is omitted as it will cover all the other cases so for example ill write if x 0 return 1 else if x 1 return 2 return 3 as you can see i omit the else and just put the return there at the end as it will handle all other cases is this alright stylewise or is there something bad about this that im not seeing thanks
student,when i run make test int the terminal it replaces the p2testscpp with filtertestcpp like so filtertestcpp p2cpp recursivelistcpp binarytreecpp recursivecpp testhelperscpp o filtertest whereas in the project 2 guide it says it should look like this p2­testscpp p2cpp recursivelistcpp binarytreecpp recursivecpp testhelperscpp ­o p2­tests and then gives me errors with filtertestcpp specifically tmpccfx9gnpo in function main filtertestcpptext0x211 undefined reference to filterrecursivelist bool int what am i doing wrong
student,i got the tail recursion to work except it is printing out the test number before it prints out the correct output if i move the cout statement to display n below when i call the function it says it is not tail recursive how can i fix this
student,do we need to write rmes for our helper functions in lab02
student,i am a little confused about the idea of writing helper functions for tail recursion is is acceptable for the helper function to be recursive but not tail recursive does the tail recursive function only return the helper function no matter what the input is if this is the case then what is the point of tail recursion in general although you are reusing the stack frame for the original function isnt that idea of reusing the stack frame being negated by the fact that youre creating a lot of stack frames in the helper function
student,are labs graded based on code that produces the correct output along with stylecommenting
student,when we write the append function can we refer to other functions that we wrote for the project
student,im not sure how to compile my program using terminal like what exact commands i need to type in im in the right folder and i wrote this to test g pedantic wall werror g p2cpp p2testscpp o p2 are these all of the files we need to include we got a huge long error message saying the following undefined symbols for architecture x8664 listfirstrecursivelist const referenced from listequalrecursivelist recursivelist in p2ccf559o sumhelperrecursivelist int in p2ccf559o producthelperrecursivelist int in p2ccf559o reversehelperrecursivelist recursivelist in p2ccf559o appendhelperrecursivelist recursivelist in p2ccf559o filteroddhelperrecursivelist recursivelist in p2ccf559o filterevenhelperrecursivelist recursivelist in p2ccf559o listprintrecursivelist const referenced from reversetest1 in p2tests8d4c91o reversetest2 in p2tests8d4c91o reversetest3 in p2tests8d4c91o reversetest4 in p2tests8d4c91o appendtest1 in p2tests8d4c91o appendtest2 in p2tests8d4c91o appendtest3 in p2tests8d4c91o and then theres way more similar paragraphs of errors involving lots of different things like test cases etc and then at the end it says ld symbols not found for architecture x8664 clang error linker command failed with exit code 1 use v to see invocation what does this mean
student,the autograder drop down menu isnt working right now
student,ive been trying to write function stubs using assertfalse which was mentioned in the spec but when i looked up assert cpluspluscom says that the assert function will terminate program execution doesnt this mean that the instant the program hits the first function stub the whole program will just end and nothing will get tested i tried putting assertfalse into every single function i havent written yet and the program does not terminate until it gets to the function stub in listt append im thinking it might be because append is the first function i have in the program that returns a list instead of an int any clarification on assert is appreciated thanks
student,are we required to follow certain style or rule for our test cases i mean something like shall we output as much information as we want for test cases without worrying anything about autograder
student,in labster i added a helper function for the tailrecursive digit counting function but im getting a semantic error saying that countdigitstailhelp is not declared in this scope does anybody know how to fix this problem
student,i am a little confused about tree containment it was mentioned in the project specs the trees contained within the sample tree given i was wondering if is contained within
student,is it ok if i make a function in p2tests that converts an array to a list that way i can easily make lists with specific values
student,ive been working on the lab for a while now and for some reason when i changed my countdigitsrecursive function my countsdigitsiterative function started giving me the wrong answer im not sure how this is possible because the iterative function was working fine for hours and i never changed it is it possible that labster is glitchy
student,i tried to build my project on sublime text 3 after i made function stubs on p2cpp and was given this error g is not recognized as an internal or external command operable program or batch file finished in 01s with exit code 1 what does this mean and how do i fix it
student,are we allowed to use the recursive function in lab 2 as a helper function for the tailrecursive function
student,where do we use this treegridsquare thing oo
student,are we allowed to call other functions when implementing later ones for example could i use reverse as part of my implementation of chop
student,can we turn in the labs by just copying and pasting the code in labster into ctools or should we make a cpp file for them
student,for project 2 we do not need to write the function in p2h correct those are provided to us in p2cpp for when i run the test im getting errors from this file
student,will we ever get to see the answers to the prelabpostlab questions
student,are all the tree functions supposed to be made tailrecursive or can they be just regular recursive i looked through the project specs and it only specified that for list operations all functions must be tailrecursive and that fibonacci sequences you need one of each but didnt specify for trees
student,how can we know what numbersdigits have been repeated or not should we be updating the value of digits then storing it in an additional variable
student,hello all i managed to get ubuntu on my laptop thank you for those who advised on my last post but i have a really difficult time connecting it to mwireless even with the security certificate downloaded from the umich it website before yesterday i could connect by just typing the password in every time i woke up the computer from sleep i tried changing this by following the instructions here httpwwwitcomitdumicheduwirelessconnectlinuxphp but i now it doesnt connect at all does anybody have any suggestions to fix this thank you in advance for guidance
student,are our p2test graded based on style
student,i had a quick question on the implementation of tree traversal for the example given the in order traversal makes sense but what if the 3 in the example had a leaf in the bottom left lets give it a value x then would the function have to output 2 first or x thanks
student,when must labs be submitted by
student,hi im currently using sshfs to access my project files which are stored on my caen computer account as outlined here httpwaleedkhanname281dealingwithcaen im able to mount a virtual drive to my computer and can access the files when they are not stored within a folder but when i try to put all of my project02 files in a project02 folder it says permission denied when i try and cd to that particular folder it also occasionally gives me an error when i try to save the files im working on why am i getting this error is there a better way to do this i was under the assumption sshfs and sublimetext was the best way to work on the projects on a mac
student,so the spec says that for the traverse function the tree 4 2 5 3 would return the list 2 3 4 5 why does it return 2 3 4 5 and not 3 2 4 5
student,which head file should be included in p2cpp except for p2h
student,since hailstone will not return any value i am having trouble understanding what should be in the cout statement
student,where do they go in p2cpp
student,i tried to compile my code but i was given this error however the ls command shows that the files are in the directory capture2png
student,i know it is recommended to create separate test functions within the main function will points be taken off if we just listed the different test cases all in main
student,for countdigitscpp is it okay if we implement a helper function for the regular recursive function
student,for each require statement for each function we need to write it says like n 0 or n0 and etc must we error check if n does not follow those rules or for the test cases you will be using to grade our project will we not need to error check for that
student,how exactly are we supposed to submit both the files is having a my code copy on labster enough to be a submission or do we have to submit both as files onto ctools if we do need to upload to ctools must the files contain solely the implementations of the specified functions or is it alright if they contain extra code written to aid in the implementation and debugging of our function implementations
student,in my email from the autograder i received full credit for every test case except for year im confused how i could get full credit for the fracyear test when i failed the regular year testcase can i have some details on the year test case
student,for the tail recursion part of lab 2 my code looks like this int countdigitstailint n int digit return countdigitstailhelpern digit 0 helper function for countdigitstail int countdigitstailhelperint n int digit int count but the program is giving me an error on the line in countdigitstail in which i call the helper function saying that line 37 countdigitstailhelper was not declared in this scope line 37 cannot convert unknown to return type of int in return statement can anyone tell why it is not recognizing my helper function
student,so i researched binary trees and types of traversal and coded a way to inordertraverse recursively but my function calls itself before returning recursively so it works but it is not tailrecursive i cannot think of a way to traverse inorder tailrecursively since i have to start with the root and find the deepest leftmost branch to begin with if i have three left trees there doesnt seem to be a way to pass all of this information into the same function call is there a maximum size for the trees i am lost
student,should we use accumulate in the implementation of sum and product
student,if we write fib to be tailrecursive using a helper function can we call the helper function from fibtail too or do we need to do fib recursively and fibtail tailrecursively
student,if you begin a hailstone sequence with 1 would the only number in the sequence be that same 1 or would you follow the rules of the sequence until you end up at 1 again ie 1 4 2 1 thanks
student,i did not have this problem using g v482 but when using make all on the caen environment using ssh i received the following conversion error i did not modify binarytreecpp at least i dont remember ever doing so any suggestions goldenaxe make all g wall werror pedantic o2 filtertestcpp p2cpp recursivelistcpp binarytreecpp recursivecpp testhelperscpp o filtertest binarytreecpp in static member function static int binarytreecalculatexoffsetint int binarytreecpp495 warning converting to int from double make filtertest error 1 goldenaxe
student,my code for countdigitscpp works for all test cases except for the how many 0s in 0 test case where each approach in the counter iterative recursive and tail recursive returns 0 since i need my base case of 0 in the recursive and tail recursive functions to return 0 for the other test cases i am unsure of how to correct this issue without messing up the answers to the rest of the test cases
student,should we be following the style guidelines for the labs eg comments explaining each part of our code or are only the projects graded for style
student,im having trouble trying to figure out how to go about writing the traverse function using the tree interface and all is there any sort of hint or nudge in the right direction that anyone could give me
student,when writing helper functions for the main function in p2cpp where should we write them should we declare them in p2cpp or in p2hcan we just write them right above the function its helping or should we keep all of them in one specific spot thanks
student,i am not sure what the chop function is supposed to do this is how i am interpreting it list passed to function 12345 n value 3 returned list 12 is this how the function works
student,i am having trouble starting to code using the proper syntax and using the given files and classes within them ive been going through the project spec but would it be also helpful to review the lecture slide for recursion and iteration
student,in the project 1 grade what is the portion called fracyears
student,so were filtering numbers in the linked list that are true meaning we just filter out 0s kinda confusedwould appreciate if any1 can clarify for me thanks
student,can someone please explain what the long test case is i failed this test case on the autograder and it would help to understand what i did wrong
student,is assert only for numbersintegersfloatswhatever ik in the pdf it says we must use assert for each of our test cases and i tried using it to show that my filterodd and filtereven functions work but i get a lot of errors
student,what is long in project 1 i get long 010 in project1
student,should we include the necessary libraries and directives for lab 2 before submitting them on ctools or is it ok to leave it as it is on labster
student,are labs graded on completeness or accuracy
student,do you have to be on mwireless for labster to work i am at home trying to finish my lab and i dont see any of the files that i was working on during the lab period
student,i am trying to think of a solution but i cannot think of a means of counting the instances of digit without passing it as a parameter in a helper function if we cannot modify the function itself can we write a helper function
student,for the reverse function are we supposed to return simply the reversed list or return the statement in the example the reverse of 3 2 1 is 1 2 3 thank you in advance
student,are we allowed to use vector operations pop pop back push back etc for the implementation of helper functions
student,i am currently working on the last bit of lab 2 in the counting digits section when i finished writing what i thought to be just a generally efficient recursive function whelper function for the regular recursive function requirement i checked wlabster and turns out that it is actually tail recursive too does this mean i need to duplicate it and edit to make a worse nonrecursive function to satisfy the general recursive function too or can i just leave the tailrecursive by itself my guess i still have to do both versions dont i
student,so i got the recursive part of countdigits to work correctly with the exception of the counter starts at the value the that the iteration left off at for example say how many 4s are in 124420 the iteration portion says there are 2 4s the recursive part starts counting from 2 instead of 0 and then counts up to 4 is it ok to reset the value of the counter to zero outside of the function loops otherwise i do not really see how to reset the counter to zero at the start of a new loop
student,after looking through piazza i am still a little confusedif we create a helper function does the original still need to be tail recursive or can the helper function just be tail recursive
student,in lab02 it seems that we should test how many digit 0s are in number 0 i just wonder how we can define this special case is the answer 0 or 1 or there might be other answer thanks
student,for helper functions are we allowed to do use default values for integers like so int helperint x int y 1 code
student,what happens if you rotate an empty list for instance you call rotatelist 10 and list i think it just returns the empty list right thanks
student,in project 2 do we assume that list can only contain nonnegative int i mean do we need to handle negative int thanks
student,is any part of our lab grade based on attendance or is it just based on lab completion theoretically could we never attend our lab section completingsubmitting the activities on our own and still receive full credit for lab
student,when working with a partner is it okay if both of us submit identical code or we both need to have different code
student,the spec doesnt seem to address what to do for all cases what should my program do when asked to add a 4 to the tree 4 3 5 2 5 according to the project spec there isnt a location to add the 4 yet it doesnt address what to do for this situation the hint also involves traversals but a function like this one isnt invertible so it is possible to convert trees to traversals but there may be more than one solution to the conversion in the opposite direction any help trying to solve this problem would be much appreciated thanks
student,trying to submit my prelab survey getting this error pretty sure im getting those captchas right
student,in the product function if we are given a list where any one element is a zero shouldnt the product automatically be zero ive written a function for it that in theory is very simple but seems to treat it as if it multiplying by 1 instead of 0
student,for lab 2 are we allowed to use break if we so desire or should we find an alternate way to solve the questions
student,the containedby functions effects clause states returns true if a is covered by b or if a is contained by either of bs subtrees does contained by only have to check if b covers a treeleftb covers a or treerightb covers a or should it check all of bs subtrees rather than either
student,will our submission for p2testscpp be allowed to have asserts is the autograder be designed to handle asserts or are they exclusively for personal testing purposes and should we remove them in our submission
student,will they not be posted the entire semester
student,i wasnt able to access the autograder on ctools is it up yet
student,my program has compiled properly and the output seems correct but now im having trouble creating a tar archive when i enter make tar the following message appears bash41 make tar make no rule to make target grouptxt needed by tar stop what could this mean
student,in the syllabus it says that we are supposed to submit one copy of the project together that makes it sound like only one person will submit to the autograder but i thought it was worth checking to make sure should only one person to submit to the autograder or should both people submit the same file on their accounts
student,hey guys so i am getting this error when i compile make test and i dont know what my problem is help
student,is it alright if we do not have prototypes for helper functions in p2cpp but instead implement the helper function definition above the function it is used in and write our rme there it is proving to be somewhat cumbersome to scroll up and down repeatedly when writing new helper functions example r m e static int sumhelpervoid return 0 int sumlistt list
student,i just started implementing so im on int sumlistt list if i want this function to be tail recursive it seems that i need to add a variable parameter to retain the sum is it expected of me to change the declaration to int sumlistt list int total i did this and it allowed me to easily make the function tail recursive am i on the right track can i add parameters like this to more functions like int productlistt list
student,i wrote stubs for all functions in p2h in p2cpp and attempted to compile using the command specified in the spec make test however i ran into the following issue make test g wall werror pedantic o2 filtertestcpp p2cpp recursivelistcpp binarytreecpp recursivecpp testhelperscpp o filtertest g wall werror pedantic o2 simpletestcpp p2cpp recursivelistcpp binarytreecpp recursivecpp testhelperscpp o simpletest g wall werror pedantic o2 treeinserttestcpp p2cpp recursivelistcpp binarytreecpp recursivecpp testhelperscpp o treeinserttest g wall werror pedantic o2 p2testscpp p2cpp recursivelistcpp binarytreecpp recursivecpp testhelperscpp o p2tests simpletest simpletestout diff simpletestout simpletestoutcorrect 34c34 1 2 3 4 5 1 2 3 4 5 5 4 3 2 1 1 2 3 4 5 11 12 13 14 15 makefile4 recipe for target test failed make test error 1 i read that error 1 means that my code is failing somewhere but the output of the console does not make it easy to discern where how or why could i get some suggestions on what to do
student,i dont think this was really made clear in the announcement so i was just wondering whether our lab surveys are graded just based on completion assuming we put in meaningful answers of course or whether correctness is also factored in
student,i added all the starter files from the google drive into my project and when i hit build i get 6 of these errors namely with some of the treerecursive functions even after commenting out a bunch of stuff i still get the errors i was wondering what i can do to fix this thanks
student,i see a lot of people having issues setting up a workflow for this class and i thought id give my opinion on the most efficient way to code i tried to write this for both mac and windows users i use a mac so this is more geared towards mac people and some windows configurations might be wrong read each tip before doing anything in case you decide you dont like my workflow downloading project files mac i personally use dropbox for all my important documents in case my computer crashes you may also want to store your files online to be safe download the p2targz file from the eecs 280 google drive manually not with wget and put it into a folder of your choosing navigate to the containing directory in terminal and use this command to unzip the file tar ­xzvf p2targz unzipping the file puts its contents into a new folder automatically make sure you type this as copying it in will not work sublime text mac and windows i use a program named sublime text 3 for most of my coding you can spend the time to learn vim if you want and i prefer it for quick fixes but you dont need to know how to use it xcode and visual studio are nice because you press a button the code compiles and it runs but that is not useful when you have more than one main function sublime text has some nice features such as tabs and splitwindows which make it easier to view and edit code sublime text is capable of syntax checking think the red squiggly lines in xcode im not going to outline it here but you can set up a c linter mac only sublime text lets you view a folders files in a sidebar use the open command commando controlo navigate to the folder containing all your project files and then click open if your files dont all show up on the left use view » sidebar » show sidebar to view multiple files at once use view » layout to set up multiple columns ssh alias mac follow the first part of this guide to set up an ssh alias making signing into caen less of a chore syncing with caen mac you want to test your code in caen so that you can ensure that the graders see the same output as you a nice explanation of how to keep files in sync with caen can be found here after testing your code locally you can then copy your files into caen and verify that the output is the same syncing with caen windows because the steps for mac dont apply to you one option is to write your code in sublime text and use git to transfer files between github and caen you can follow the steps below on using git to set up your files on your local machine code locally push from your machine pull to caen and then run your code using g git does not come preinstalled on windows so you need to download it make sure to select command prompt instead of git shell when installing using git with github mac windows caen this project also is the first in which we are allowed to have partners one effective way to share your code is using github here is a guide on creating a git repository using terminal or command prompt make sure you set up your project as a private repository to not break the honor code in the project go to settings » collaborators to add your partner you can get 5 free private repositories by getting the github student developer pack it took about a week to process my application remember how to use the command line cd to change directories cd to go up one directory ls windows dir to view the folders and files in your current directory pwd windows echo cd to see which directory youre in these are commands to download pull and upload push code once you are in the project directory to download code git pull origin master to prepare to upload code you must first save commit it git commit m message here to upload code git push origin master make sure you and your partner dont work on the same functions simultaneously because youll get merge errors which suck if your partner set up the private repository instead of you navigate to the directory in which you want to store the project download the project files using this command git clone url from the github page you can get the url from this box in the github page using a makefile windows users you need to be on caen to do this mac users you can do this on both your local machine and caen this project introduced a new type of file called a makefile theyre useful because you type in one or two words to compile your code unlike the last project where you typed a bunch of g for this project just type this in make this compiles all of the programs that you can run if you only want to compile one of them you can invoke make with a target make target where target is one of the keywords in the makefile they gave you to see what these targets are open the makefile the options are not indented and are followed by a colon all filtertest simpletest treeinserttest p2tests test filtertest simpletest treeinserttest p2tests simpletest simpletestout diff simpletestout

and either exit or show you the compile errors once the make command has succeeded you can run the generated programs for example after compiling p2tests you would run the program like this p2tests this will run the code as if you had clicked run on xcode or visual studio other notes debugging using gdb and g flags are explained well in the lab01 document so look there for instructions in the command line pressing up will go to the previous input making it easier to remember commands
student,where and how should i write helper functions that i want to expose to both p2cpp and p2testcpp thank you
student,1 do we need to make functions that are not directly related to the functions we need to create tail recursive too for instance if we decide to make a count elements for a list function do we need to make that tail recursive 2 also can we use loops in our test cases functions
student,i know that we are recommended to write our test as functions does this mean we have to write rmes for these functions or can we just write a simple comment about what the function tests
student,when using the command make test i received the following message binarytreecpp in static member function static int binarytreecalculatexoffsetint int binarytreecpp495 warning converting to int from double make filtertest error 1 what would this mean does this keep the program from compiling properly and letting me submit it
student,for inputs to the functions can we expect that they will follow the requires clause so that there isnt any erroneous input
student,while creating our test cases are we allowed to create new cpp files and new h for better organization also which files are we allowed to edit
student,i submitted my lab01 on jan15th i want to see i got pass but when i open the lab01 my status changed from submitted to in progress since the website allow me to submit again i submitted my lab01 again but the website shows submitted late is it going to affect my grade i still keep the email notification from jan15th
student,is the order of the functions in the spec supposed to be the order we write them in would it be beneficial to write them in that order or no
student,what is an efficient way to get all my files to the console is there a way to use the wget function to grab the targz file from the google drive if so what would you type in the command line just the url
student,im trying to incorporate a partial function into a selection statement basically by saying if partialfunction fails im not really sure what happens when these functions fail so i dont really know how to write this selection statement any insight
student,consider the pretty useless function below int uselesslistt list return uselesslist here listt is the same listt defined in recursiveh this function looks tailrecursive in fact if you replace listt with int the compiler will perform tail call optimization and essentially turn the function into a while true loop you can tell because if you look at the assembly code that it outputs with o2 s theres a jmp instruction where a normal recursive function would have a call however this function is not tailrecursive since there is still work to do after the recursive call namely running the destructor of the list variable indeed if you look at the assembly the compiler emits a call instruction where you would have expected a jmp if it were performing tail call optimization and so this function is just plain old recursive rather than tailrecursive the workaround would be to make the function take its argument by const reference instead of by value but were not allowed to use reference arguments now the project spec says that the list functions we have to write have to be tailrecursive so does that mean that they have to be actually tailrecursive or can they be almost tailrecursive except for the listt destructor
student,hii i went to 1695 bbb for madelines office hours but i dont think she was thereand where are robs office hours located
student,i imported all of the files into xcode and started to write an implementation in a p2cpp file but these are the errors that i keep going that are also preventing me from compiling undefined symbols for architecture x8664 inserttreeint binarytree referenced from main in treeinserttesto ld symbols not found for architecture x8664 clang error linker command failed with exit code 1 use v to see invocation am i supposed to exclude certain cpp files from the compiling process how does that work again
student,im wondering if its okay to be using a helper function for each main function we have to write im not exactly sure how to do any of these without helper functions so the ones like sum and product have helper functions and i just want to be sure that this is okay
student,if we write helper functions do we need to comment them or is it assumed that they have the same effect as the function they help
student,protip 2 instead of putting all your tests in main and making life more difficultespecially for the graders put each test case in a function if we choose to follow the tip does this mean we have to write a separate p2testsh or are we to put it in testhelperh
student,do i need to add my name to it and submit again or just leave it like that
student,were allowed to use whilefordowhileetc for the testcase cpp file right
student,in the project 2 spec we are given the following code as an example of a tail recursive function static int factorialhelperint n int result if n return result else return factorialhelpern1 nresult int factorialtailint n return factorialhelpern 1 lets say i make some modifications how about i rewrite this as static int factorialhelperint n int result if n return result else int nminusone n1 int ntimesresult nresult return factorialhelpernminusone ntimesresult int factorialtailint n return factorialhelpern 1 would this still be a tail recursive function im sorry if this is a bad question im just making double sure
student,i made a helper function that returns the length of a list is it alright to usetest this function in my code
student,can we use a helper function with the tailrecursive fibonacci function
student,under the header file for p2 for accumulate function the requirement is that fn must be associative can someone please tell me what fn is
student,while testing accumulate and filter can we write additional functions in p2testscpp outside of the main function that we can use to call accumulate and filter
student,for the rotate function n will never exceed the length of the list correct
student,could someone please explain the functionality of both the accumulate function and the third filter function for lists i believe the fn is throwing me off ive never seen this syntax can someone explain to me what it means thank you very much
student,the project2pdf says we should hand in a grouptxt in the submittargz but can anyone tell me what is this grouptxt
student,what exactly is the append function asking us to do
student,how can i is there away to access individual numbers within a list ie if i have a list 3 4 5 4 2 9 8 and i wanted to have access to the 3 item perhaps a better question would be is should i be writing a helper function access these or is there some syntax i am missing like lista2 i know that isnt right but its the general point i am trying to make thanks so much
student,returns the sum of each element in list zero if the list is empty so i notice that in the for loop of the p2testscpp that for each loop lista is being assigned a new linked list with each i getting closer to 5 by return the sum of each element in list zero if the list is empty mean in list zero corresponding to an i value of 0 return the sum of each element each one is a node which have nexts so like return the sum of each next of the i or is that statement supposed to be zero like return the sum of each element in the list if it not empty and if it is empty return 0
student,im having a lot of trouble understanding what the accumulate function does can anyone provide a clearer explanation
student,the function description says we are to create a function to sort a binary tree however in all the examples given in the spec the tree is sorted before insertion of a new element should we assume that the same will be the case for test inputs
student,effects returns the list first second listt appendlistt first listt second given first 1 2 3 4 and second 5 6 7 8 should append return 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 or 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8
student,should we define and put the rmes for helper functions in the p2cpp file or in the header
student,the project says that we cant use static variables what exactly are they
student,how many points off is this or will i just get no credit at all
student,im confused about the descriptions for int sum and int product what do list one and list zero in these descriptions mean
student,i just added eecs280 today and i dont have access to ctools now how can i submit my lab01cpp
student,do all of our recursive functions need helper functions or is it possible to make a tail recursive function without one
student,hi everyone i am looking for a partner for project 2 preferably someone who can easily get to central campus i took eecs 183 last semester so my c is pretty fresh if youre interested post on here
student,are we allowed to work with a partner for project 2
student,i think we are allowed to use loops in our p2testcpp is that right
student,in the instructions for lab01 when it tells us to debug and use next to go over our code i noticed that it does not show the return 0 line after goodbye world instead it just shows the line here is what it looks like httppuusheby9387cd6c1787png i dont see anywhere in the instructions it telling us to remove return 0 i only see that it says to add goodbye world after everything else is printed when i used next to go through my code it showed return 0 as line 25 before going to as line 26 will i get points off if i dont remove return 0 thanks in advance for any clarification
student,will there be any difference between an element having two empty subtrees and an element having no subtrees in our project for example is the same tree or different
student,i cant find any headers for the list functions that were supposed to implement for project 2 do we just create headers in recursiveh and write the function in recursivecpp
student,i would like to use the following libraries for my project 2 test cases but not in my project 2 cpps themselves includeiostream includecassert includecmath includecstdlib includesstream i am particularly fond of sstream which i use to capture output then convert it into a string painfree can i use them
student,i am a little confused by the spec and am running into trouble getting my program to compile in visual studio i added all of the source and header files into one project in p2cpp i have included all of the header files and none of the cpp files i have 13 stubbed functions with the assert command as shown in the spec if i start to include returns
student,since mac os is unixbased and mac users have access to the g compiler and most of the command line commands in terminal are the same as the caen linux machines is it worth it to host my files on the remote server and use an ssh login cant i just host the file locally access it via terminal and have the same functionality as a caen linux ssh login session if not what cant i do on mac sans ssh login to caen linux besides a remote backup what are the advantages of an ssh login and remote file storage
student,i thought the project was due tomorrow but i just realized its due tonight my code works perfectly in xcode and i tried submitting just the p1cpp and the autograde gave me a message saying that my code didnt extract properly can someone please explain to me how to submit from caen or what i have to do to successfully submit this caen vnc isnt working on my computer any help would be greatly appreciated thanks
student,hi there i enrolled in eecs 280 last weekend but still cant get access to caen computer with both stations on campus and remote connection my attempts to access is always denied and shows i am not authorized to use caen since the due time of project 1 is a few hours away can i submit the file using someone elses caen station i will do the submission with my own umid and ctools just using someone elses id to get access to the caen computer
student,can we use include mathh
student,hello a quick question as i am doing last edits on the comments i was just wondering about the integer year checks can we have to have our code to check whether the year input is an integer just once and then go ahead with the 2nd input assuming that the user indeed input an integer value the second time around or do we have to have our code to repeatedly check and ask until the the input is given as an integer
student,so i am connected to caen and attempting to run my file however i am getting these couple errors and im not sure how to fix help appreciated
student,hi just a quick question is lab due every friday night
student,i get this error when i submit my zip folder i have looked at other posted questions and when i run terminal commands to look in the zip folder it has all my code not sure what i did wrong
student,when im using os x which keystroke does emacs see as the meta key thanks
student,looking through the past questions on this i just wanted to confirm some things the detailed submission is disabled for now so we will only see the result of one test case and our provisional score is 0 we will not have an indication of our final score because our code will be tested more thoroughly so all we can do right now is test it ourselves using various test cases can an instructor confirm this
student,when i use diff to find the differences between the correct example and my example it produces this output 13c13 please enter the monthly payment please enter the interest rate please enter the duration of the loan in years please enter the monthly payment please enter the interest rate please enter the duration of the loan in years which i understand means change lines 13 of the first document to match the second but the output it shows me shows that they are exactly the same not sure what im doing wrong
student,i successfully created a tar archive with p1cpp and submitted it to the autograder and received a 1010 however i am aware that the spec mentions compiling code in g using a certain command i am not familiar with g and never did any of this with my project but as i said still received a 1010 on the autograder did i miss a step am i missing something
student,really quick question i have an incorrect ip address saved for connecting to the caen linux server i was just wondering what the correct one is thanks
student,i followed the spec perfectly but when i submit my zip file it still says could not extract my code compiles and everything i wasted two submissions turning in the zip file only for it to say the same thing why wont the zip file submit i know im using the proper command for caen linux if i run out of autograder submissions will my project just not get turned in
student,when i use emacs m appears in my code how do i get rid of it is it a problem
student,eventhough the autograder sends back a perfect grade the provisional score is zero is this normal
student,when im using the terminal on caen is there a limit on the number of printed lines that can be displayed at a given time when im testing my p1cpp and i enter a large number of years the highest month printed is always 511 rather than the maximum 1200 however when i run my code in xcode or in a terminal on os x i can view all 1200 months is this a matter of the terminal or do you think my code isnt running right in this environment thanks
student,what errors in input for years should we be checking for the project discription says note that you must do a small amount of additional error checking on the years input if the user enters something other than an integer number of years call getparam again with the same promptlimits does something other than an integer number of years mean we should make sure that the input is not a double like 12 i understand were not supposed to account for an input of a char or string
student,hey community my program compiles and passed the compile test with in out on linux however when i submit my tar ball steps shown in the screenshot it gives me this error your submission failed to extract properly i looked up this problem on piazza but it seems like people didnt compress the file properly in their cases please let me know what i could be doing wrong
student,when i am trying to open the p1exe the system error jumped out and says the program cant start because cygwin1dll is missing from your computer try reinstalling the program to fix this problem is this the computers problem or mine i used the computer in uglis basement thanks
student,do we need to consider the situation that user inputs a character like a or a string instead of a valid number
student,how are we supposed to check if our test case results are correct
student,is the textbook material supposed to be different from the lecture material
student,my motto has always been to put an abundant amount of comments as opposed to too many is there a downside to this besides possibly slowing down the runtime i would prefer to be better safe than sorry
student,i have inlcude ioh and both the ioh and iocpp file in the same directory and still cannot get the function to work i keep getting the compiler message tmpccakg4xzo in function main p1cpptext0x2b undefined reference to getparamstdbasicstringchar stdchartraits stdallocator double double collect2 ld returned 1 exit status
student,the equation provided in the spec b b ­ p ­ b r12 and its rearrangements however how do i calculate the balance before the first month of payment
student,is there a command to download the file to desktop from ssh or how to transfer it to an accessible point using scpsftp i only know how to download the entire terminal log
student,i submitted my code on monday and i got a 1010 today i realized i needed to make a small change i did that created a new tar zip file and submitted however this time it says that it wont compile and i tested it and my code compiles perfectly im not sure i what to do
student,in my p1cpp i only wrote one function int main which calls upon the other functions defined in iocpp and declared in ioh to carry out the task of the project because my main function does not require any inputs nor does it modify any inputs do i need a requires and modifies section of comments also for the effects section would i just give a brief description of the project itself thank you
student,i wrote a function that receives input from the user and should i write the range of the acceptable inputs for monthly payment and interest rate in effects
student,are we allowed to use other libraries in addition to the ones included in ioh and iocpp
student,ive gone through and completed all the instructions for the lab and changed the to in the code when i run the program normally in terminal using g it prints the correct its a big world message when in enter in 250000 but when i run the diff checker its still saying that its printing the incorrect its a small world any idea what might be going on
student,i am using ssh to access caen and after typing the following command wget googlhpwlmv o tar xzk i got the error message wget command not found i thought this was because i am running os x yosemite but i am running through caen right any help would be appreciated
student,just wanted to ask if testing the output of my code with another student is a violation of the honor code we do not share code but just the output is that alright or not allowed
student,the project spec says that the input to number of years must be an integer however it does not specify what to do if it is not an integer should we ask the user for another duration round down or up or take the decimal to mean part of a year and just have a number of months not divisible by 12
student,my friend is a 281 ta and wrote this article i think it will help all those wanting an easier way to sync files between caen and their computers httpwaleedkhanname281dealingwithcaen
student,when i try to use gdb as the pdf introduces i did not get the same result when using the step command i cannot step into the function and when i try to use break as shown in pdf it was an error
student,since the coding isnt very lengthy for project 1 i put all of it in int main is it necessary to have other functions or is it fine to just leave it all in int main
student,im still slightly confused about how our final grade for our project will be determined i understand that a portion of the grade is based on functionality and the other portion comes from our codes style does a 1010 on the autograder guarantee us a perfect score on the functionality portion of the grade or are there additional cases tested that the autograder doesnt cover
student,i run the same code on linux it says big world and then i run the same code on xcode it says small world any idea why the same code could have 2 different results
student,when attempting to save for lab01 in nano using apple o i am prompted to save it in my mac desktop and not my caen directory is there a way to fix this or do i have to transfer the file via mfile
student,i used the caen vnc to submit my lab and its not showing up as submitted in windows is there a fix for this
student,im a little confused as to what is meant by pending computation when determining if a function is plainrecursive or tailrecursive is this referring to another recursive call following the original or is it just any step that involves some computation with the input variables that follows the recursive function call
student,in the autograder it gives me a total score and a provisional score i got a 1010 for the total score but i keep gettting a 00 for the provisional score am i supposed to get a 0 or another number
student,in the online reading section 121 example 110 looks like this could someone help me understand this function i dont know how to read this syntax thanks
student,i have compiled my p1cpp a couple times already and now i am doing exactly what i was doing before but terminal is telling me that various directories are not found bash41 cd documents bash41 cd project1 bash41 ls exampleoutcorrect iocpp ioh p1cpp bash41 g ­pedantic ­wall ­werror –o1 p1cpp iocpp ­o p1 g ­pedantic no such file or directory g ­wall no such file or directory g ­werror no such file or directory g –o1 no such file or directory g ­o no such file or directory g p1 no such file or directory bash41 i have already accessed my caen account and when i use command ls it shows the all of the files i want to access are there i cant figure out what is wrong
student,do we need to comment our names and the date and that kind of stuff at the top
student,for our own functions where should we put the declarations and definitions should we add them to iocpp and ioh put them on top of the main in p1cpp or something else
student,in my code which i realize isnt completely correct yet the alignment of my headers does not exactly match the columns beneath them i did not touch the iocpp so im curious if anyone else has had this problem and how they fixed it or if this is even a problem at all thanks
student,lets say that i am running my program and reach the part where i am prompted for the numbers of years i am asked please enter the duration of the loan in years if i put in 501 then i would be asked to put in the duration of the loan again and that is fine but what if i put in 500 is this considered a valid integer input or does it necessarily have to be 5 with no decimal or decimal numbers
student,my code is messier and longer if i include a function since this project is so short is it okay if i dont use functions
student,ive used cd in the linux command line to get to the folder where my project 1 files are but when i try to type the command to run the file or create a zip file it says no such file or directory why is the command line not recognizing my files i know im in the right folder
student,ive been trying out different methods outlined on the caen help sites but am having some trouble figuring out a method to transfer files more specifically the edited lab01cpp file from my computer to a caen computer through the terminalcommand line any advice
student,ive been able to ssh into caen but confused how to change directory now i was able to before i typed in my password and got access when i hit ls the following shows up applevolumes network trash folder private public shared if i type cd desktopproj1 i get the following desktopproj1 no such file or directory what should i do
student,where do we need to write the comments in the text box or in our program
student,when i submit my finished p1cpp to ctool autograderit says that your submission failed to extract properly and i get 0 for this p1cpp so how to submit my p1cpp
student,do we have to use functions for project 1
student,i wrote all my code on a caen computer but for some reason now everytime i try to open the code from the terminal it crashes and acts as if nothing is in my project1 folder that i made even though that is how ive been accessing it the whole time is there anyway to get this error to stop happening or to recover my code thanks
student,how can i get data from cin i mean when user type year duration1 how can i get that 1 from cin
student,when i was testing my program and using large numbers for years i noticed a problem in the output formatting when it goes from four digits 1000 to 3 digits 999 in the years columns the values in the table are offset this only happens here and not when going from three digits to two or two digits to one is it a problem with my code or something in the printmonthlydata function that was given to us
student,in the p1cpp i type inculde ioh and in my main function and i call void printheader void in main function the function can run however there are nothing appears no month principal interest balance
student,i recently wrote and compiled my cpp fie for project1 after submitting to the autograder successfully i realized that i should make test cases after writing and testing my cases i obtained decimal precision errors for large interest rates and a large number of years for example if i pay 100000 a month with an interest rate of 1 and for 100 years i will eventually have the following output months principal interest balance 961 000 10000000 119999999 960 000 10000000 119999999 959 000 10000000 120000000 1 000 10000000 120000000 by month 1200 i will eventually have fully paid off the balance but the existence of this precision error is still bothering me clearly paying 000 between months 959 will not give me a balance of 119999999 on month 960 can i consider this inconsistency a feature of a valid program or a bug that i should correct thank you
student,after doing a few test cases on xcode it appears that my code is working properly including prompting the user to enter number of years again if their input is not an integer however i wanted to try some of these incorrect tests on caen to make sure that my program is working in that environment when i test number of years as an integer it works like it should when i write 15 or some other noninteger number as the input for number of years the caen remote environment kind of freaks out and freezes up and makes it so that i cant open the exampleout file to see what the output was i just wanted to know if this is supposed to happen because there is no other input in the examplein file when it reprompts the user is this correct or does this mean my code is not working in caenlinux and the exampleout file should just show the 3 questions instead of the 3 questions plus the table of values when a noninteger value is inputted for number of years hopefully my question makes sense and any help would be appreciated
student,i unfortunately slept through my assigned discussion section today are we allowed to go to a discussion we arent technically signed up for or should i just wait until next week did i miss anything essential
student,i have submitted my project and received 1010 however i wanted to clarify something about the years input as of now if someone types 25 then getparam only reads up to the and therefore goes through the calculations for 2 years is this correct if not can i get a hint on how to change it as of now i declare int years 0 and then a while loop that as all as it is equal to 0 to keep asking for input
student,should i use functions in iocpp or i just write some my own functions
student,im at 1695 for office hours right now is someone going to come in
student,hello all during mondays lecture on stack frames and recursion among other topics i was a little confused on how return exactly operates within stack frame managment my professor stated that return basically marks the destruction of a given stack frame my question is how does the data pushed out during this return call move to the next level within a recursion function i would love to understand this process at a more under the hood level i asked about this during lecture but due to the tight time limits of an hourandahalf lecture with so much to cover we couldnt go into much detail my professor stated that the stacks refer to the same variable however my understanding of passbyvalue variables is that while they might have the same nameidentifier each variable is basically distinct as far as memory locations are concerned my initial thought is that there is an intermediary that handles this handoff but im not sure i embrace any and all clarifications as to how thisthese processes work thank you
student,1 what component of the computer is the hardware associated with the stack and how is stack size determined by this component 2 are all stack frames the same size the comparison between a piece of recursive code and a while loop the recursive code used multiple stack frames compared to the while loop which used just one does the recursive code actually have more space since it has more frames or is it just partitioning the space
student,i am trying to run the commands p1 examplein exampleout diff exampleout exampleoutcorrect but i keep on getting p1 no such file or directory
student,my program is getting the right input for the test case but im just a little confused conceptually on whats going on with the yearly interest rate in order to produce the correct results it seems like the interest rate must be reset back to its original userentered value after having performing the calculation for a particular month in order to make the calculation for the next month why is that i looked at 91 but it doesnt mention anything about manually resetting the interest rate
student,what does undefined reference to main mean how should i fix it
student,hey everyone so this must be a super simple mistake but im a bit rusty with coding and i cannot get my loop to update basically after i gather all the needed parameters i enter the loop and then proceed to do the calculations however it just keeps reiterating the first inputs ie 100 05 1 theres something really small im missing here any help is appreciated
student,if they are identical is that mean that i have no bug in my code but my exampleout looks a little odd it is off by one set starting at the month 9
student,i am trying to run my program in visual studio to start out and i am getting an error that states unresolved external symbolmain referenced in function tmaincrtstart up does anyone have any idea what this means this is my own error
student,where do we find ringenbergs lecture recording i checked on caen and only found deorio and fu why is that
student,hello so my code seems to work other than my initial balance its always off by 1 cent at the very beginning and then is fine im assuming the way that i set it up is wrong but i cant figure out how exactly im pretty sure that the rounding is what throws it off the principal is technically 99585 while the balance is 99583 if anyone ran into this problemhas any ideas of how this happened let me know thank you
student,okay i finished coding in visual studio and am trying to transfer my file to caen i downloaded putty and logged in now what should i do
student,this is where i currently have the ioh and iocpp except theres one problem my p1cpp doesnt compile with those files there what do i do to make it work sorry if this question seems elementary but i recently switched over to vs
student,for my program if the user inputs 23 for the year lets say it prompts the user to enter a year again however when they put 20 it works is this ok
student,how do i navigate to a directory in command line if the name of the directory has spaces in it for example i want to navigate to a folder called um winter 15 and i get the following response i am assuming the problem is that the directory name has spaces in it but im not sure how to get past this
student,i was trying out some test cases for my project and tried inputs such as 100000000000000000000000001 for the interest rate and 10000000000000000000000000000000001 for the monthly payment and rather than calling getparam again my project went ahead did the calculations and printed the table of values obviously these inputs are just barely outside the specified range and kind of ridiculous but is this something i should worry about
student,can anyone help me to think about the interest rate question how to know the principal and balance if we just know interest rate and loan duration and monthly payment
student,ive logged into cyberduck and am trying to use to copy files from my mac onto linux the initial login was successful and i can view my afs directory but every time i try to actually copy anything over from mac to linux it tells me that permission was denied
student,where can i find hw assignments i have searched ctools but coundnt find it
student,ive been putting the minimum and maximum values as global constants at the beginning of my code as ive used one pair two times and i thought that this might make the code look cleaner i was just wondering if this is fine or is discouraged
student,im trying to zip p1 on a mac using terminal using xcode its located in my documents and i keep getting this response in terminal not really sure what is going on
student,whenever i run the program in visual studio and in linux and enter a duration that is fairly large 45 years the display only shows 511 months 511 510 509 and doesnt show the header either i was wondering if this had to do with how much the terminal can display and how to change that
student,if we receive a score eg 1010 on the autograder does that mean that our code successfully compiles on the caen computers or should we doublecheck anyway on caen
student,for the getparam function do we assume that interest rate is number between 0 and 1 do we have to check if user input is non number
student,i had a question concerning the placement of functions declarations and definitions as i understand it definitions can also be declarations but in most code that ive seen which didnt have any linked files there would always be function declarations before int main and definitions after int main is that the format that is expected of us on project 1 for helper functions we write and further on if we should have another project that doesnt involve submitting header files
student,so i understand how to check whether or not it is an integer i was wondering am i supposed to reject the input if it is a double and require them to reenter the duration of the loan or should i change the input by dropping anything after the decimal point thank you in advance
student,i know a couple of posts have been made concerning style and rmes but i just wanted to clarify what some of the expectations were in the iocpp file i only see effects clauses above all the functions and a couple have modifies clauses for our helper functions beyond writing what the functions effect is should we put anything else ie in the modifies clause i guess im just a little confused at to what the modifies clause is for thanks in advance
student,in my algorithm i used a variable in my iteration to calculate the balance for the next month when compiling i get a message that says this variable does not need to be initialized in this function obviously if i dont initalize it it will say variable wasnt defined in this scope
student,as far as i understand the requires clause is supposed to give any restrictions that the function has in order to execute properly with respect to project 1 if you were to write a function that took the interest rate as an input do you need to say that the function requires the interest to be a number between 0 and 1 even though there is already code that makes sure of that basically do we need to state requirements that have already been checked elsewhere in the code but not necessarily in the function being described
student,so i was swapping my discussion today since the only discussion that was open conflicted with my lecturei had to choose one with a waitlist but wolverine access is telling me that i am waitlisted for the lecture too even though it said there were 16 seats openwill my grades still be registered with this class or do i need to contact someone else
student,as i am doing my code i am confused as to if you are using the information from examplein but submitting it through the console or if you want to connect the file to your code using fstream if you use fstream how would you be tested with other cases since it would be reading from the file not console sorry if this is a stupid question
student,the style guide on google drive says try to keep your lines short 80 characters is 80 characters a hard limit or is it okay if i have a few lines that are slightly over 80 characters say less than 85 and it would look rather ugly if i put a line break anywhere in it also how many spaces should we count tab characters as when counting how many characters our lines are i wouldnt want to hypothetically say in a parallel universe get screwed over on style because i use 4space tabs while the graders grade with 40space tabs yikes
student,if it is not on the google calendar are we still meeting for the lab
student,hi so after i create a zip file and submit to the autograder it always gives me a zero and the message that my archive failed to extract properly does anyone know what im doing wrong my code compiles on linux and i got rid of all the extra example files but the problem persists thanks
student,ive just finished writing the code for my program and it seems to be working for the example case however i did not writeuse any additional functions other than the ones given to us in ioh everything ive written is within the main function are we expected to write functions for our calculations and include rmes and prototypes or is having all code within main okay
student,the years variable must be and checked for as an integer is it okay if the variable entered is like 10 20 50 or even 80 in that its a double but technically is equivalent
student,my code gets it right up until month 4 however i do the math with a calculator and get the same answer my code produces 78521 100 10512 881537 or 88154 is there something wrong with the equation im using
student,hi so i read the files on the google drive quite a few times but i think i still need a little help to understand how this whole thing works this is what ive so far thought of so i write my code on my own pc just the way i did in eecs 183 on visual studios after im done writing the code i log into a caen computer using the vmware view software i downloaded then i transfer my finished project files to this caen computer using one of those programs that transfers files i then use puttyemacs to runtest my code and make changes then if im happy with the changes made i transfer back the files to my pc and finally i submit the files to the auto grader from my pc im sorry if i give you a facepalm moment after you read this but im kind of slow at learning things like this and the google drive files havent really helped me too much id really appreciate any help
student,ive gone through the previous discussions mentioning this issue and i cant figure out whats going on my code compiles on caen i created a tar archive in the caen environment through ssh on my mac and the contents seem to be fine when i input tar xzof submittargz the contents of my p1cpp file shows up as expected when i input tar tzf submittargz p1cpp appears i downloaded submittargz from mfiles and submitted submittargz to the autograder from my home computer is it possible that something is going wrong when i download it i noticed that the gz gets erased once i download the archive so i tried adding it manually but that doesnt help any help would be appreciated
student,hello i finished my program today and i as i was going to try to compile it in g i get an error error ioh no such file or directory even though ioh iocpp and p1cpp are all in the present working directory even after moving them to another folder i still get this issuewhat could be the problem
student,if the getparam function returns a double how are you supposed to check whether the user entered something other than an integer
student,how do we run the example test case i was in my directory that contains my project in my terminal and i typed the following commands p1 examplein exampleout diff exampleout exampleoutcorrect but nothing happened was i supposed to execute these commands elsewhere
student,my code compiled in caen but when i submitted to the autograder this was the feedback test case results test case example failed to compile example 010 total score 010 why did my program fail
student,i am working on xcode but i periodically copy my updated program to caen and save there do i have to convert p1cpp to a zip every time i update and save the code
student,when i compile my code using the wall and werror it displays an error for the for loop i use to print the data line by line statement has no effect however when i compile and test the code without them it compiles and works perfectly i think this is the reason the autograder gives my submission 010 why does this error happen and how can i fix it
student,my file is named correctly and saved in documents when i went to terminal to create the zip for p1cpp and i used the command it says tar p1cpp cannot stat no such file or directory what should i do
student,to compute the principle balance and interest rate for each of the months how are we supposed to store the information of each year to use the data to compute the following years info if the values are always changing right now i am trying to define the 3 variables using the b b p 1 r 12 equation but cant seem to figure out how to standardize the b variable
student,i have my finished p1cpp and it works perfectly however even after reading the specs i do not understand what im supposed to do in order to create a zip file where will the file be saved and how do i go about creating it
student,hi may be a very basic c question i have always been told to write using namespace std and today i see a new program written in this way there is nousing namespace std here but instead use stdcout stdendl my question is what is std indeed and can any one explain the using of std shown in the picture above thanks
student,i used the examplein file and i got the right solutions but when i tried to use autogravder it said that your submission failed to extract properly however i did use the submittargz file i am not sure how to fix the issue
student,i followed the guidelines listed in the project1pdf and created the gzipped tar archive however i received feedback from the autograder stating it failed to extract properly the outputs themselves were the same and all i did in terminal was create the p1 and check the outputs does anyone know what might have caused this issue thanks
student,often times i find that the nearest caen computers that work are a bit of a hike away and the vnc portal can be laggy slow buggy or difficult to connect to i was just wondering if any students or instructors have any thoughts about dual booting ubuntu or some other linux os on my laptop thank you for your feedback in advance
student,are we allowed to include iomanip unsure as to what is a part of the standard c library
student,i am not quite sure how to obtain what the user inputs as called by cin in the given functions how can we get this cin value and store it in our main function
student,despite the fact that i am getting the correct output the autograder is giving me a 010 how can i find the feedback
student,i have a loop to determine whether the duration value is an integer or not but it loops infinitely if i enter a letter instead this will not be a problem for the test cases correct
student,when i try to compile my code it gives me something that looks like this undefined reference to getparamstdbasicstringchar stdchartraitschar stdallocatorchar double double it gives similar errors for all of the other functions what could possibly be wrong with my code
student,for the three prompts that ask or inputs can we have const string to hold them is it considered as bad style
student,my program works on xcode but i cant figure out how to create a zip file so i can submit it to the autograder does anyone know how
student,is cmath included in the c standard library
student,hi all when i submit my zipped targz archive to the autograder i am told that my p1cpp file was missing when it is actually there has anyone run into anything similar to this
student,i know this has been asked before but im still unclear as to how we can check if the user entered a double or an integer for getparam with years my first thought was to have my program produce the prompt as long as cin was failing but cin never fails because if the user enters a double it just cuts off the number at the decimal point and makes it an integerim not sure what else to do thanks
student,my code reproduces the exact output in the spec except for the last four lines where it is off by 1 100th is this the conceptual error described in 91 anyone have insight into why it might be off for only the last four lines
student,are we supposed to put our uniqname name and project description on the top of p1cpp like in eecs183
student,my code compiles and executes correctly in visual studio in the past i have had no errors when uploading my cpp files written in visual studio to the autograder however after wrapping the cpp file in a targz file the autograder is sending me back a compiler error any suggestions as to resolve this problem and avoid it in the future would be appreciated thank you
student,not to sound od or anything but i just need help on where or how often i use comment at the moment i dont have access to the autograder yet my code works fine on the example provided but because my code is barely 50 lines of code and i dont think use rems makes sense in any part of my code due to the short length of it i cant really assess whether i would remember it in three months of not or if it is simple or too complex by any means could an instructor please provide me with a short simple list of rulesconventions for commenting not necessarily styling ie indentation so i know what i should do for this project and in the future
student,my code works in xcode and did not work when submitted to the auto grader which i know means that my code must not be working correctly in g my question is how to go about fixing this all i really have is a loop and some variables so im a little confused as to why it wouldnt be working
student,hey guys decided i couldnt take eecs 280 this semester and so im selling my c primer book required book for the class brand new only read a few chapters before class i did write my name on in but throw some tape on that part and its like it never was there offer me what you think its worth also sorry if this is frowned open in this forum just trying to help someone out
student,does anyone know what an extended initializer list is when i try to compile my code i get the following error along with several others regarding primaryexpressions constructorsdestructors error extended initializer lists only available with stdc0x or stdgnu0x thanks in advance for your help and sorry if this is super obvious
student,im still trying to manage my class schedule and when i try to switch discussion sections to fit another class in i get an error saying that the class is closed and no waitlist is available is this intentional does this mean we have no option to switch discussion sections at this point in time
student,i connect the caen on my own laptop and how can do next the only thing i can do is coding on xcode can anyone tell me how to code on that caen
student,hi im just kind of confused on how the interest rates in the practice table is being calculated can someone please clarify how the interest rate isnt 5 at month 1 and why it isnt 0 at month 12
student,when i try to click on the ctools autograder tab it says you are not in the classlist how do i fix this
student,will there be any office hours on main campus
student,after submitting the zip file to autograder is the total score or the provisional score our actual score
student,when i tried submitting my code to the autograder it returned a 0 and said gray indicates there was no information on the test for the submission what should i do to fix this
student,when zipping the p1cpp file should we zip it using caen or our personal computer
student,i am little confused on what to do with the test cases are we supposed to modify examplein and are we supposed to include examplein in our zip file
student,all of my code if working out fine except for the part where i use the printheader function this function is a bit confusing for me because i have never encountered this before this function recieves an input of type void however that parameter is not given an identifier so do i just insert an input anyways and if so what do i use as an input
student,after creating a zip file for p1cpp i figured my code consist of errors so i modified p1cpp but when i try to run it on g my previous code is executed instead of the updated one can anyone please tell why this is happening
student,which file should be uploaded to autograder it only allows one while there are three files ioh iocpp p1cpp
student,when are office hours tomorrow is there a schedule of office hours somewhere thanks
student,as a forewarning most of this post will probably not be too important for most students this post will be a mass of questions concerning details on coding style using the project 1 distribution code as reference ioh includes the string library but does not introduce the standard namespace instead opting to use the scope operator iocpp on the other hand introduces the standard namespace 1 is using namespace std optional effects prints the prompt and reads a double from cin if the value is between min and max inclusive returns it otherwise repeats double getparamstdstring prompt double min double max 2 can rmes be multiline comments if so is or preferred 3 is it alright to exclude parts of the rme if they are not relevant eg does not require or modify anything 4 are function names supposed to be uppercase effects prints out a nice header for the payment info table modifies cout void printheader void 5 can the elements of an rme have varying order eg effects requires then modifies 6 does modifies have to include everything that is changed or modified such as cout not just modified parameters 7 is a space between the function name and the left parenthesis allowed does this also carry over to function calls effects prints out a row in the payment info table modifies standard output stream void printmonthlydata int month double principal double interest double loaned 8 when the list of parameters are many which of the following cases are acceptable or recommended case 1 beginning of first parameter void superlongfunctionunsigned long long parameter1 unsigned long long parameter2 int value1 int value2 int value3 case 2 two tabs 8 spaces from beginning of statement void superlongfunctionunsigned long long parameter1 unsigned long long parameter2 int value1 int value2 int value3 case 3 tabbed to same column void superlongfunction unsigned long long paramter1 unsigned long long parameter2 int value1 int value2 int value3 case 4 all tabbed to same column 2 tabs void superlongfunction unsigned long long parameter1 unsigned long long parameter2 int value1 int value2 int value3 case 5 all tabbed to same column can be combined with case 4 void superlongfunction unsigned long long parameter1 unsigned long long parameter2 int value1 int value2 int value3
student,when i sat down to write this program i was going to just calculate the payments starting from the beginning balance of this loan which is the present value of the annuity payments each month and then just calculating the principal paid and interest paid as the bank would in real life im just wondering why the professors decided to go backwards counter intuitive to me i thought about just doing it my way saving the results in an array or multiple lolz and then printing it in reverse but ill just go backwards because i believe there is a potential to get different numbers when going backwards vs going forward im also too lazy to do the extra steps just wondering best chris
student,when i type in a word such as foo into a question like this please enter the monthly payment my compiler goes crazy it will incessantly print please enter the monthly payment over and over and over again not allowing me to enter another input i have to control z to stop the program on the other hand if i type in a number outside of the min and max range it reprints please enter the monthly payment only once allowing me to enter another number which is the expected behavior does anyone know why cin result from getparam function gets completely ignored if i type a word thanks
student,because this project is meant to be easy and very simple for us to understand do we have to put in comments
student,i received an override to enroll in eecs 280 yesterday and i still do not have access to the autograder or caen will i get access soon or is there something i need to do first its saying my password is incorrect when i try to ssh into caen thanks
student,if two people form a group then each group will have 6 times of autograder with feedback or three times
student,is it better to have the rme above the function prototype function definition or both
student,for this project can we use include mathh
student,i am first to caen environment and linux stuffs i took eecs 183 last semester so i am more used to code in visual studio i dont know where to start should i download caen first or do i not have to worry about it now but just have to code project1 first on visual studio and then transfer it to caen someone help me
student,since the ioh already includes the string library would it be wrong to include it in our project code
student,i have never used command line for anything can someone help describe how i copy the ioh and iocpp directories to my own with terminal i am using a mac if that matters thank you
student,i used mac xcode to programme my project 1 and test by my own the result is correct however the auto grader gives me 010 which means i didnt pass any test i wonder whether i should turn to linux does anyone succeed in a mac computer
student,ive followed the instructions in the quickreferences but when i try to copy and paste or even drag my files to caen that ive accessed through vnc it wont work what am i doing wrong
student,in engineering 101 we were able to remotely connect to the caen linux environment is this possible to do in this class if so what usernamepassword should we use i tried the one from last semester and it didnt work and then tried to use the one that i used to create the dreamspark at caen and that didnt work either what should i do
student,for the example given does anyone understand why the outstanding balance for the first month is 116812 rather 1200
student,maybe this is a really easy one and im just too rusty from eecs 183 but im including ioh at the top of my p1cpp file but i cant call ioprintheader in my p1cpp main function without it being some type of an error do any of you have any idea why this would be an error
student,im planning on write my code in xcode and copy my files into vnc but when finish copying how can i run those files do i open p1cpp in negit and use command or commandline to run it and just to be clear examplein and exampleoutcorrect are just for test im not opening an file in p1cpp right creating the archive should also be done and submitted via caen correct this is really confusing
student,for tomorrows event do we actually get to see the whole of the imitation game or is it just an analysis of the concept in the movie with a few clips here and there ive been trying to watch the imitation game for so long benedict cumberbatch is awesome
student,sorry if this has been asked already but no examples were given where the time to repay the loan was longer than a year so i just want to make sure if its longer than a year we count the months down from the total amount of months correct ex if it was 3 years it would go 36 35 34etc thanks
student,does our project have to contain any comments to describe the functionality of our code
student,when i copy and paste the g line from the spec into terminal with the flags to check for things i get the following errors clang error no such file or directory ­pedantic clang error no such file or directory ­wall clang error no such file or directory ­werror clang error no such file or directory –o1 clang error no such file or directory ­o clang error no such file or directory p1 additionally when i paste this line p1 examplein exampleout it returns bash p1 no such file or directory finally when i paste this tar ­f submittargz ­czv p1cpp i get usage list tar tf archivefilename extract tar xf archivefilename create tar cf archivefilename filenames help tar help how can i fix these errors so in the future debugging is possible i was able to compile my program without the flags and switch around some of the syntax to make a zip file and submit it but i want to know for future reference
student,if were writing an equation that includes 1 would the 1 be a magic number in other words would the 1 have to be substituted for a const int whose value is 1 or can i leave it
student,should we be rounding our values to the hundredth place every time a calculation is completed or should we keep the values as they are and let printmonthlydata take care of the rounding for us eg balance 100125 balance roundbalance changed to 10013 printmonthlydata balance passes 10013 and prints 10013 or balance 100125 printmonthlydata balance passes 100125 and prints 10012 fixed and setprecision floors the value
student,i get an error in my program for the header that says error symbols not found for architecture i included ioh in my p1cpp does anyone know why this is happening or how to fix it
student,when i try to compile my p1cpp file using the command g pedantic wall werror o1 p1cpp iocpp o p1 i get the following g pedantic no such file or directory g wall no such file or directory g werror no such file or directory g o no such file or directory i am using the command when i am in my project1 folder which contains all of the files for this project and when i use the command g p1cpp iocpp o p1 i am able to compile and run my program does anyone have any idea why i am getting those messages
student,i copypasted the hello world code from lecture and tried to compile it just to familiarize myself with c again and i got a really strange error it appears to have some problem with the standard include iostream statement i noticed that it references a file in a the caenhspice directory in the error description ive used the hspice software before in another eecs class but i dont see why that would affect my ability to compile programs with g any thoughts on why this is occurring
student,since project 1 is not lengthy i wrote my entire program in the main function and was wondering whether that requires rme clauses
student,is the score we got from the feedback will be exactly the score we receive for project assume this is the very last submission
student,i didnt use linix and i wrote p1cpp in visual studio how should these code been connected
student,what is the total score of project1 and if i have got 10 points from autograder does it mean that the 10 points is guaranteed
student,when we check to see if the input for year is a valid integer how should we account for the case where someone enters 450 should this cause the getparam to execute again or take 45 as the year input because it is technically an integer
student,i just wrote my code in xcode do i have to transfer that code into a text editor
student,i am a little confused on how to use caen i wrote my code in xcode and i used the ssh command to get caen in terminal but where do i go from here
student,im just trying a testsubmit but i dont know how to go beyond the actual project 1 folder on my desktop in terminal it just says project 1 is a directory do you type tar czvf submittargz p1cpp right after the directory it didnt work for me also are we just compressing the p1cpp file or the entire project file
student,my code for project 1 executes correctly when tested on xcode when i run it on terminal on the caen linux environment the prompts are not printed and there is no output whatsoever the terminal takes the command does nothing and prompts the next input there is however a file titled p1 that appears on my desktop but i cannot do anything with it when i view it in emacs it is a long series of characters that is unreadable what can i do differently to get my code to execute
student,if we decide to write helper functions should we put the rmes of helper functions in p1cpp below the main function
student,ive found that using cyberduck and sshing into the caen network through the terminal is really effective when it comes to managingeditingcompilingdebugging your files ie you dont have to physically sit in the computer labs nor do you have to waste time connecting using vnc it makes the entire coding process 10x faster imo
student,im having trouble understanding whenif to floor any of the values my interest for my first line is off by 01 and then it just starts to deviate from there and then my last interest value is off by 1 i dont think the specs specifically mentioned whenif to round any values so im looking for any guidance here thanks
student,whenwhere is the homework for labs posted is it just to be completed in class or are there ways to prepare beforehand
student,is there a template or style for the header of the p1cpp file like where i would put my name or the date
student,do you have any small hints about how to check if a number input by the user is an integer thank you
student,is there anything to do after submitting the archive to autograder will the last version that is submitted to autograder be automatically recorded as our final submission if we dont make any further changes
student,for project 1 the autograder only runs the test case thats given to us in the example files correct will our final grade depend on other test cases not given to us
student,i wrote my program in visual studio i have successfully remoted to a caen linux terminal with putty i am now trying to copy my p1cpp from my machine to the remoted machine so that i can see if it compiles i have tried several solutions but i am consistently getting stuck with the same error any ideas silly mistake must be somewhere
student,when trying to create the file i keep getting an error bash41 tar ­f submittargz ­czv p1cpp tar invalid option im using the remote linux commandline interface and the file is in the correct place
student,will the total score on the autograder be my final score for project 1 or you will also add a style grade to it later
student,is it considered good style to create a function that will only be used once but will improve readability
student,which program should i use to begin coding
student,in the specifications for project 1 it says that we can assume the inputs will be of the proper type just not necessarily within the bounds can we assume that for the monthly payment input which does not have to be an integer that the input will be of precision 2 ie two decimal places if not should we round this value to the nearest hundredth before performing calculations or perform calculations using the monterarilynonexistent double value thanks
student,looking far ahead here theres a conflict with math 215 apr 23 10301230 and eecs 280 apr 23 10301130 final exam will there be alternate exam times available
student,so my project compiles in caen and not on the autograder i went to office hours and we werent able to see what the issue was so the gsi told me to make a piazza post would anyone know why im having this issue i think the poster of 40 is having the same problem as me
student,im starting out with the following hello world program include iostream include iocpp using namespace std int main cout hi endl return 0 and try to compile with the following command g pedantic wall werror o1 p1cpp iocpp o p1 but i get the following errors in iocpp tmpcctzmflio in function getparamstdbasicstringchar stdchartraitschar stdallocatorchar double double iocpptext0x27 multiple definition of getparamstdbasicstringchar stdchartraitschar stdallocatorchar double double tmpcc192svgop1cpptext0x27 first defined here tmpcctzmflio in function printheader iocpptext0x8c multiple definition of printheader tmpcc192svgop1cpptext0xfb first defined here tmpcctzmflio in function printmonthlydataint double double double iocpptext0x1c2 multiple definition of printmonthlydataint double double double tmpcc192svgop1cpptext0x231 first defined here collect2 ld returned 1 exit status i also tried simply g p1cpp iocpp but i get the same errors what am i doing wrong here i apologize in advance if it is something really obvious
student,can i attend different discussion sections or are the lab assignments unique to each discussion
student,if we cannot attend office hours this week is it possible to selflearn how to navigate caen i currently have no idea how to go about coding in this platform i only know to code in xcode
student,i am using vnc but have trouble in logging in the problems is that i cant input my user name when i click my cursor to username blank and type my keyboard no word appear in the blank i wonder if there is similar situation and whats your solution thank
student,so far ive just used terminal to run my project and test it but im having trouble using the command given in the spec sheet to convert it to a zip file ive tried to use the ssh client but im not sure how to use the tar ­f submittargz ­czv p1cpp command in terminal can someone walk me through the steps to use that command thanks
student,if i manage to successfully connect to one of the caen computer systems or i go to one of the caen labs and successfully login where would i go to begin writing code and compiling the same goes for programming externally and moving files between machines thanks in advance
student,will there be discussion sections this week thanks
student,there are no differences between the example and my project yet autograder keeps telling me that example failed to compilewhat is going onis linux secretly tricking me into thinking im getting the right output or something
student,my program uses the floor function when testing with microsoft visual it seemed to work but in the caen environment i got a message saying floor was not declared in this scope what could be causing the problem also i got a message saying that there is no newline at the end of my file what does that mean
student,i ran my project in netbeans and got the correct output when i try to run it in linux i get undefined references for all of the functions that are from th eheader file i mean i did include ioh idk what is going on
student,how many percent does the total score returned by the autograder count toward the final score of our projects
student,i recall reading somewhere that we should bring either laptops or tablets to our discussion section which tablets would be appropriate how could one meaningfully participate in programming exercises on an ipad for example
student,i read the spec for project 1 and i understand what the program is supposed to output however i do not understand which platformprogram i need to use to write the p1cpp file i used visual studio to write all my files in eecs 183 last semester but i no longer have access so now i dont know how to go about writing files i have looked at the resources provided on google drive but i feel overwhelmed and more confused by the options because i havent used linux before any help would be appreciated as i want to get started on this project as soon as possible thanks
student,what will this code print int grade 61 cout grade 60 pass fail endl based on the book this code will print 1 and something unknown see section 47 however when i try to run this code in visual studio there is an error and print nothing can anyone tell me what will print thank you very much
student,will discussions be held tomorrow
student,if we are not including the iocpp file in the code i am writing what purpose does it serve
student,i see these two functions being called on in the printmonthlydata function what do these do and where do they come from
student,this is my first time to use linux could someone explain briefly the relationship between linux ubuntu g and c
student,so i read the spec for project 1 and t says that there are some files in my project 1 directory i dont know where it is located however am i supposed to make my own or is it made for me like it was in engr101 thanks
student,ive been using putty provided by the um internet access kit and its been working very well for me but it seems like others are trying to use the caen vnc i was not aware of the caen vnc and i am still not quite sure how to use sftpscp to transfer files so ive been using mfile for the moment which methods are recommended which are not allowed and what are the benefits and disadvantages of using one over another
student,this is my first course using linux system and i do not see particular file for eecs 280 in my desktop of linux anybody facing same problem with me will it be ok after winter semester start formally
student,i have a few questions regarding programming for eecs 280 this coming semester firstly does all of the coding have to be done on a caen computer or is there a way to do it remotely from my own laptop i managed to connect to the caen system using the caen vnc but nothing will open for me and i get repeated error messages about configurations in that vane im not entirely sure which platform to use in order to conform to the specifications for uploading and grading the projects i know im to use standard c and it the programs must be submitted compile and run correctly in the eecs linux environment but i am unsure of how to proceed with this any advice you could give would be immensely helpful so that i can make sure i have a grasp on the technical before falling too far behind on project 1 thanks
student,can we use our own helper functions in the project
student,im a bit confused about the instructions for the command lines used to compile my code and convert it to a tar archive i used microsoft visual to write my code so what steps do i take to compile and convert my program
student,is it okay to declare global variables in p1cpp
student,i can find my score in two place and these two are for the same submission but which one is my final score for the project also what does the provisional score mean
student,if the input for duration is a double should we just use the integer part of this double or should we ask for another input until we get a int
student,i understand that the autograder will tell us if our code compiles or not in g on linux but will it also tell us whether or not our projects successfully ran the hidden test cases im sure it wont tell us which or how many test cases but will we at least get an indication of whether there were runtime errors or not thanks
student,what c standard should we use when compiling projects and assignments
student,i just use functions from iocpp to output my data but i found that there are differences about space between header of the form between my output and the correct output i really dont know why since i havent change anything in iocpp
student,after i have submitted my submittargz containing p1cpp why is the status of my submission keeps being running rather than graded
student,so i dropped this class last semester and im retaking it and from what ive read of the specs so far project 1 seems to be very similar to the project 1 of last semester if not identical am i allowed to submit my old project files for grading
student,after i submitted project 1 i get a unexpected error and it says i should contact course staff i wonder if piazza is a right way to contact
student,hi i was wondering if we could submit to the autograder as many times as we like or if there is a set limited number of submits per day i was going through the syllabus and couldnt seem to find an answer thanks in advance

student,first
student,piazza is a qa platform designed to get you great answers from classmates and instructors fast weve put together this list of tips you might find handy as you get started 1 ask questions the best way to get answers is to ask questions ask questions on piazza rather than emailing your teaching staff so everyone can benefit from the response and so you can get answers from classmates who are up as late as you are 2 edit questions and answers wikistyle think of piazza as a qa wiki for your class every question has just a single students answer that students can edit collectively and a single instructors’ answer for instructors 3 add a followup to comment or ask further questions to comment on or ask further questions about a post start a followup discussion mark it resolved when the issue has been addressed and add any relevant information back into the qa above 4 go anonymous shy no problem you can always opt to post or edit anonymously 5 tag your posts its far more convenient to find all posts about your homework 3 or midterm 1 when the posts are tagged type a “” before a key word to tag click a blue tag in a post or the question feed to filter for all posts that share that tag 6 format code and equations adding a code snippet click the pre or tt button in the question editor to add preformatted or inline teletype text mathematical equation click the fx button to access the latex editor to build a nicely formatted equation 7 view and download class details and resources click the course page button in your top bar to access the class syllabus staff contact information office hours details and course resources—all in one place contact the piazza team anytime with questions or comments at teampiazzacom we love feedback

student,hi all of our listtests had a compilation failure on autograder this is odd because when we tested it it compiled perfectly plus all the other tests stack calc and rational compiled and gave the right output on autograder
student,to all the tas and professors thank you all very much for an amazing semester it means so much to all of us and we appreciate all your help and support also for funzies this is the song that was playing in my head before checking my grade this morning httpswwwyoutubecomwatchvtmwxwosvgi
student,i google searched images under umich eecs 280 memes wondering what i would find first thing i see is this little gem and i just had to share it
student,will our finals be uploaded to gradescope like the midterm was
student,any estimation of when our grades will be released
student,about to get real sentimental tear when the cold of winter comes starless night will cover day in the veiling of the sun we will walk in bitter rain but in dreams i can hear your name and in dreams we will meet again when the seas and mountains fall and we come to end of days in the dark i hear a call calling me there i will go there and back again thanks staff for the wonderful course and all the time you put into office hoursreview sessionsand being fabulous people thank you to my fellow students for the time you put into this class so i wasnt alone when we struggled in the bbb lobby and it was like 1130pm it made my heart smile seeing us all work together in studying in lecture etc yall a great group of people catch you on the flip side allie
student,will there be any lingering office hours for questions on project grades etc
student,my assigned exam room is stamps does this mean the classroom
student,if derived der is of derived type why is value initialized to 5
student,is templating in c jit compilation if so what impact on performancespace does it have on the programme and to what extent can the compiler continue to add to the text part of the memory model
student,for this snippet of code animal aptr new animal is the type of aptr technically animal or pointertoanimalanimal
student,this question is more a high level question about classes if a derived class inherits all the member variables of the base class why will the following code not execute class base protected int x public baseint t xt cout base ctor endl class derived public base public derivedint t xt cout derived ctor endl int main derived d3 return 0
student,one of the main points im confused about is how ninjallamas i am a ninjallama cout statement is not outputted here is what i have for parts a and b class superllama public constructor superllamastring namein int spitdistin namenamein spitdistspitdistin cout superllama ctor endl virtual void printdescription const cout name can spit spitdist meters endl virtual void usesuperpower const 0 virtual superllama cout superllama dtor endl private string name int spitdist my first gut instinct was to remove the virtual from superllamas printdescription but then when it comes time to whoopingllama i get kinda confused with its printdescription for the whooping ctor i also dont put any cout statements in it but maybe thats illegal class whoopingllama public superllama public ctor whoopingllama string name int spitdist superllamaname spitdist what to do with printdescription virtual void usesuperpower const cout whoop whoop endl virtual whoopingllama cout whoopingllama dtor endl i would appreciate any help with this
student,i know that derived classes inherit the base classes private member variables but why cant the derived class touch the inherited member variables if its its own member variables are they just a reference to the base classes member variables or are they actually the derived classs member variables
student,can someone explain to me what declaring a function as virtual does i know what it means for one to be declared as pure virtual i think my current understanding is that a virtual function is called based upon an objects dynamic type is that correct
student,i am getting confused for some reason for a list implementation how do we create a new node is it node a new node or node a new node thank you
student,for question 1d part i on the spring exam the code is as follows int main c ptr new c1 b b return 0 c and b both inherit from a by the way i am wondering when main reaches the closing bracket which set of destructors run first do b dtor a dtor run first and then c dtor a dtor i was under the impression that the most recently created object is destroyed first much appreciated
student,is the static type of ptr in this example void or something else animal ptr animal a ptr a also if this was an exam question that said what is the dynamic type of ptr would the answer be animal or animal pointer it was never stated that clearly in lecture
student,
student,i sort of understand the output but not entirely so we look for a nonvirt2 function dont find one in the derived class and find one in the base class but then since virt2 is called in the base class wouldnt the base class implementation of virt2 run if virt2 was called in main i know the derived class definition would be used but why is it used within the context of base
student,so what are freshness and temporary variable type
student,am i correct that in this example the static type of ptr is animal and the dynamic type is fish fish f animal ptr f
student,so first can anyone tell me what the correct answer for this one is really appreciate it and also how can we know whether we want to keep the data in heap or not
student,if my base class has two pure virtual functions and i override only one of them in a derived class is the derived class still pure virtual
student,so i know that in the solution for this one it doesnt exit with an error but my question is why it doesnt i know that in b the process ends due to a seg fault from the ifi size line shouldnt it do the same for part a though so lets say we are just going through the while loop i 0 enter the while loop i i 1 arr1 73 cout loaded 74 endl next iteration i 3 so we dont throw an exception i i is now equal to 2 arr2 54 cout loaded 54 endl next iteration i 3 because i is currently equal to 2 so we can keep going i i is now equal to 3 arr3 106 error seg fault arrays are zero indexed and so an array with a size of 3 has a highest index of 2
student,when i wrote this code as a test it got a compiler error void cpyderived bear cout in cpy endl int main base fish new derived cpyfish return 0 the error said no matching function call for cpy i wouldve thought this would be fine to do because when you dereference fish you would get derived so why does it not work
student,is this example shape s askuseruser enters isosceles triangle t dynamiccasttriangles similar to the other examples like turtle t animal ptr t basically my question is would this set t properly and not have it point to null i think it would but just making sure thanks
student,why does is the output a n c n 125 n unhandled exception when it gets to deriveddouble123 since derived doesnt have any commands it goes to the base case and makes basedouble123 which is caught by catchbasedouble so shouldnt caught basedouble be printed or is it that it is thrown to both catchbasedouble and catch at the same time and catch terminates the code
student,
student,say a base class has only a default constructor and a derived class has a custom constructor if you use the derived class custom constructor would the base default constructor be called first ex class guy guy class greatguy public guy greatguy string h what if the base class also had a custom constructor with the same prototype as the derived one ex class guy guy int i class greatguy public guy greatguy int i also what if the base class had a different custom constructor than the derived class ex class guy guy int i class greatguy public guy greatguy string h
student,in the initialize list what do you mean by capacityint cap capacitydefault
student,hello everyone on my previous cheat sheet i wrote the following im not sure anymore why you cant increment the char ptr pointer does the compiler automatically make it char const ptr if so why does adding char str ptr allow for increment again are there any other differences between char and char thanks in advance
student,when there is a throw statement inside a catch block it immediately exits out of that function and goes one step back to where it was called to find a catch block for that statement correct ex foo try catchint k string s throw s catchstring n instead of going into the second catch block it will go back to main assuming that was where foo was called initially and search for a string catch block
student,when an error is thrown and caught does the program continue on after the catch statement is executed or does it execute the catch statement and end the processprogram
student,if there are two catch blocks beneath a try statement the first catching ints and the second catching doubles and the second one throws an int will it be caught by the first catch try throw double catch int n cout int caught endl catch double d throw int would this output int caught
student,i noticed that sometimes we need to put typename before declaring in iterator like fortypename listtiterator i when exactly do we need to put typename before declaring an iterator
student,on the winter exam it says the best implementation for a destructor is startteststarttest delete data data 0 but what i thought in a program you were supposed to do delete variable variable 0 and doing so was like calling the destructor but apparently thats the same as the destructor implementation and youre not supposed to call starttest anyway to use it whats the deal
student,so is virtual needed in base for derived classes to run correct derived functions not base function this is the case for pointers but how about for regular variables derivedprint does base also need virtual print for some reason my compiler works and prints the correct output even without virtual in base for both pointer and non pointers so thats why im confused
student,i am having trouble finding whats wrong with the code for number 1 can someone give a hint when i run code i get pointer being freed was not allocated
student,just want to check
student,the last portion of this question is downcasting happening here
student,can a subclass declare a function to be virtual if it isnt virtual in the superclass
student,i understand how virt4inc increments bases version of value but im struggling to understand why calling nonvirt4 calls the base version im assuming its due to the baseptr accessing it but wouldnt the compiler know at compile time that baseptr is still pointing to a derived object i was under the assumption that virtual only mattered when you were creating different derived or parent variables at runtime
student,why is the for loop for this question this foriterator it begin itend rather than calling using begin and end
student,im still confused as to what happens after the catch block runs the lec slides were unclear for me does the program end or continues right after the throw statement
student,what is the value of derived42
student,q1is score a dynamic variable or a pointer to a double in the second case i would assume as a private member variable it is a local variable q2are private member variables local variables q3 will ovrachvr cause a memory leak or will the destructor run with the termination of the program
student,i know that abstract classes have to have at least one pure virtual function for every subclass that derives from the abstract class is it necessary that you override all of the pure virtual functions of the abstract class or can it work only overriding a few or even none
student,when do destructors automatically run
student,is unhandled exception printed before leaving main in 5c
student,so you have this class ninjallama public superllama public and then im confused as to why for the ninjallama ctor you have basically ninjallamasuperllama what does it mean to have superllama here again if its already inheriting from superllama when you declare the class is it just saying to assign the name and spit distance for ninjallama in the same way you did for superllama ie are these two constructors equivalent ninjallamastring name int spitdist superllamaname spitdist ninjallamastring name int spitdist namenamein spitdistancespitdistancein
student,seeing that we are supposed to draw out most things in order to be able to efficiently solve questions on the exam will we be provided extra scrap paper there doesnt seem to be enough space on the actual exam to draw things like linked lists and memory diagrams out
student,is the heap memory allocated by the global var static finalgrade ovrachvr1000 deallocated when the program ends
student,say we initialize a variable new int3 is that a memory leak immediately or does the compiler assign some pointer pointing to that int on the heap
student,example of strengthening the post condition or weakening the precondition
student,to do this could you do void somefunction for if break or void somefunction for if return would either way do the same thing and is the return okay even though the function is void in this case
student,is a member variable in a class that isnt static global or is it local
student,when traversing a list in order to delete all its elements using a while loop doesnt doing delete ptr ptr 0 make the ptr unable to be incremented since it now points to 0
student,lets say you have a base class a and two derived classes b and c which both derive from a but do not derive from each other if you had an list of a objects is there a way to determine if each object is a b object or a c object without having a variable or function that can tell you can you iterate through and use dynamic cast
student,what does this line mean derivedstring fs what does the f refer to how do i follow this through the code handle the exceptions thanks
student,just want to verify that im doing this the right way is this right animal to duck good duck to animal bad thanks
student,from one of the exam review worksheets it says that an abstract class must have at least 1 pure virtual function while an interface has only 1 pure virtual function what exactly does this signify besides the apparent difference in virtual function count
student,if i were to dynamically allocate a vector i believe the code would look like vectorint vec new vectorint is the size of the vector dynamic and do we know that the memory is going to be right next to each other or is dynamically allocating a vector not allowed
student,im trying to recall what exactly grow was is that where you have a list or was it vector or array and you create a new bigger list and copy over all the other things from the original list onto it
student,i am trying to use labster to step through the petal functions from the spring final exam i am getting a syntax error with the struct node line any ideas
student,are you assuming that in 1e that the base class is a pure virtual function i am trying to figure out whether or not you are allowed to create an object of type base
student,so in this question studentfavoriteclass is declared a global as eecs 370 im not really sure how this will actually function when you get into the question of what would the code output basically can anyone explain how a global member variable works and what that means in this context thanks
student,so class a has a constructor and a destructor does that mean that it is not a pure virtual function since not all of its member functions are virtual
student,to ask this question i am going to consider class list from lecture which has class iterator as a member class if you had another class outside of list lets call it class foo and you made list a friend class of foo would iterator also be considered a friend class of foo what if you made iterator a friend class of foo im pretty sure that would not also give list access to foo s private member parts but im not positive also if you had a subclass of list called class list1 public list and you made list a friend class of foo would list1 also be considered a friend class of foo or would you have to explicitly make list1 a friend class in order for it to have access to the private member parts of foo
student,my question is what if were told to go through a list to do something with it and we are given the list class implementation but the the implementation does not include the functions front or end we arent allowed to use iterators so i know well use nodes to go through the list but what will be initialise the node to to start with the beginning of the list since first is a private variable also what if were told to iterate through the list and were told the class includes iterators but we arent given the implementation to see which functions are available to us do i just assume that the functions begin and end are there for our use since i need something to iterate through the list
student,hey yall i think one of the best ways to study for this class is to code out the practice exam problems and step through them to learn how they work the problem with that is copypasting code from pdfs sucks it ruins the formatting and leaves random unicode characters everywhere so i did all the hard work for you and fixed up the code and uploaded it to dropbox study hard my friends httpswwwdropboxcomshivqnjd1cjym9jf8aacuvumt7anmyfoqq4ds14cadl0
student,would memory be leaked if no exception is caught then delete arr is called so no memory leak there but then if an exception is caught would the program either a keep running and eventually call delete arr or b if its like 5b it wouldnt be able to catch the exception and would get to the end of the int main which would then delete the arr
student,i get the jist of it it goes into foo where it will print a t1 t2 isnt true since theyre the same thing so we go down the try block and cout c and throw dervieddouble123 so we go down foo and one of the catch blocks matches it catch basedouble e so we print out 123 set a string to caught basedouble then throw a string my question is shouldnt catch catch the string i thought catch can match any exception type so shouldnt it catch the string where we then print out caught something
student,i understand that the default constructor runs upon creating an instance of that class but if i specifically call the custom constructor when instantiating does the default one still run
student,is there any case where we should create a virtual copy constructor and virtual overloaded assignment operator im thinking if we have an abstract class that has dynamic data but how exactly would that work do all copy constructors run automatically starting from the base class what about
student,int main new intset3 first of all is memory leaked because theres no pointer to access the data or because theres no delete function called second how much memory is leaked assuming 4b int and 8b int and why thanks
student,would the deconstructors be run when int main ends for the dynamic memory or is are they only run when delete is called
student,if a class derived inherits from base and you throw a derived exception can this be caught by a catch looking for base this has to do with problem 5 on the spring 2015 final would this work if we were catching by pointers to these classes
student,im unsure what drawing this would look like intset isp new intset delete isp isp 0 would isp point to a class in the heap what does it look like as a class like is it a big box the class itself with littler boxes inside it representing all the member variables and functions and then its deleted like any old variable at the end ie crossed off at delete isp
student,in the implementation of base class and derived class why dont they have virtual dtors is it because no variable lives on the heap so we wont worry about memory leak
student,
student,can you call delete on an iterator will it delete the memory object that the iterator is pointing to example listintiterator i listbegin delete i
student,i dont completely understand what setting a pointer to 0 does say a pointer ptr is pointing to an object on the heap if you were to do ptr 0 before doing delete ptr would that mean that ptr now points to 0 or that the thing ptr is pointing to becomes 0 and if it is the former then does that mean there is a memory leak because there is no way of deleting the heap object because there is no way of accessing it
student,if theres anyone who has the answers for these practice problems i am willing to share answers to the practice exams as well as the functor practice problems
student,why doesnt ninjallama dtor run when delete steve is called within main does that just mean for this problem that both the base class superllama and the derived whoopingllama are the only two that should have dtors in them wouldnt this cause a memory leak though because the ninjallama dtor doesnt run thanks
student,like this int ptr new int6 ptr 0 delete ptr
student,if an uncaught exception propagates to main and main doesnt catch it does it give a run time error or does it just return 0 or what
student,why the line pptridentify outputs i am a builder shouldnt the output be i am a person thanks
student,what if i declare a function like void functionname 0 is this still pure virtual without the virtual
student,can someone give me a brief run down of how const works for each of these im getting everything mixed up and am generally confused 1 const void func implementation 2 void funcconst thing a implementation 3 void func const implementation 4 const int func implementation thanks
student,will the lowest not pass in this case lab be dropped from the final grade calculations
student,if derived classes need a unique destructor for their private members does the base class destructor have to be virtual
student,why not just always use assert is the try catch stuff just more specific or efficient or something
student,when calling b b would that print b ctor b dtor or b ctor a dtor the same goes for c ptr nex c1 i guess what im asking is how the virtual functions would act
student,if you throw a variable does it automatically go to where the last try was and then uses the catch statements below that try meaning can you have a catch inside of a function that does not have a try
student,if a throw causes a program to terminate with an error before memory is cleaned up is this a memory leak or does the leak in memory not matter because the program didnt execute successfully anyway
student,in the constructor for a derived class will we always need to pass in the constructor of the parent type as the first entry in the initializer list for the derived type for example class duckpublic bird private int age public duckstring namein birdnamein age0 currently i believe we do because in order to have a duck we first need to create the bird right i just want to make sure i have the right idea
student,i think that basenonvirt2 would be called because the dynamic type is derived and the derived object has access to the base member functions 1 am i correct in this analysis basenonvirt2 then calls virt2 2 would this be derivedvirt2 because its a virtual function and the dynamic type is derived
student,a little confused i thought i heard during lecture that all code involving a templated container needs to be in the h file however if its all in the h file for member functions do we still need to put template typename t at the top of each in addition to at the top of the class and then proceed to begin writing the function definition as bool listt empty for instance im just confused on when templatetypename t and including listt before the function def is required what files were supposed to be writing these templated classesfunctions in any help would me much appreciated
student,why did vidal say number exception caught is on the line after loaded all data why is not range error caught since 106 100 is a rangeex not thrown in checkdata
student,in the required output of main why does i am a ninjallama which is in printdescription of class ninjallama not print after steve can spit 42 meters how would i implement the classes so that happens
student,is the reason there is a compiler error because the static int getgradyear doesnt know what its int is immediately like it has to wait until the student constructor runs also for the first part is it because the static variable is already set to something in this case eecs 370
student,in llamafactory since whoopingllamas and ninjallamas do not have access to the private member variables of superllama how can we initialize name and spitdist after creating a dynamic llama ie does this code work if not how do i fix it superllama ptr new ninjallama ptrname name ptrspitdist spitdistance
student,in w15 4a the 3rd line of code reads base b2 b is the copy constructor called here or is the normal constructor called followed by the assignment operator thanks
student,why is caught base double leaked
student,whats the different between the following int const arr6 const int arr6
student,say there is a base class which has a virtual function that returns a string the derived class overrides this function with a function that instead does exit1 does the derived class still follow the lsp i was thinking no since replacing an object of the base class with an object of the derived class is not supposed to affect the functionality of the program and in this case it does since it would cause the program to terminate
student,are we supposed to know what both of these are
student,is it possible to make a linked list without using the heap
student,why does triangle inherit shapes perimeter implementation each shape needs its own implementation for perimeter right is this just a way to show that subtypes can inherit member functions of their parents at this point in time shape isnt pure virtual all of its function implementations are return 0 thank you
student,what are the criteria for downcasting a base class to a derived class using dynamiccast to work does the derived class have to have all the same member variables and functions
student,the question asks if creating an object of class a would cause a compiler error vidal said the answer was yes is that because its a base class
student,im working on the rotate function from lecture 1516 practice worksheet and i am stuck i understand that to rotate a list youre simply manipulating the next and prev pointers my strategy works for lists with 3 elements but i am confused on how to iterate through the list itself manipulate the middle elements does anyone have any hints on how to approach these problems please help thanks
student,this is in reference to p5 on winter and spring i know by quickly playing around that if class base class derived public base try throw derived catch base do something the catch block will successfully handle the exception however both these classes are virtually empty i was wondering if there are any specific rules situations or exceptions no pun intended in which the derived class will not be caught by a catch block of type base and if so will that be in the scope of our exam thanks
student,see subject
student,i posted this to the instructors but still havent gotten a response i believe there is an error it says which classes are interfaces any that have only pure virtual functions apple according to the slides an interface class is a class declaration without memory variables but apple does have 2 member variables
student,base class has coutmestring in derived class has coutme why cant i call both functions from a derived object if both functions have different prototypes
student,do inherited classes inherit private variables of the parent class
student,could we be asked to draw a heap stack diagram on the exam like shown in lectures
student,the practice problems folder on google drive only contains the solutions for the practice problems from the first review session lec 1114 will solutions be uploaded from the second review session lec 1516 and the final review problem set
student,could someone please explain vidals for 3c wouldnt hasseen always return true because it would see the very first item also would solutions not using hasseen still be allowed thanks
student,in winter15 exam 1b does variable perfect belong to local or temporary and what variables are temporary
student,why using basevirt3 is a better practice than using the origianl expression
student,why is the syntax for the assignment overload ifthis rhs why is it rhs and not just rhs is this rhs the same thing or does a pointer only return an address when it is to the right of and not thank you
student,say a derived function follows the liskov principle we then add an additional member function to the derived class does it still follow the principle
student,i know from deorios lecture slides that a local variable is any variable defined within a block considering this would it be incorrect to also define a local variable as one created within the scope of a function
student,i dont really get what it means to have an iterator not in a for loop for example from lecture there was bool noduplicates const listint l for listintiterator i lbegin i end i listintiterator j i j for j lend j ifi j return false return true although looking at it now would the listintiterator j i j for j lend j be the same as for listintiterator j i j end j if so when if ever would you need an iterator not in a for loop
student,when you write a functor with a predicate is the predicate taken in in the default constructor or do you just write a member function with a pred that isnt withing the class if you do store it would you take in and store a predicate pointer or simply a pred
student,hello is the above possible thanks
student,i dont understand how this question is working because i expected the output to be 11 11 11 but instead the correct answer is 6 10 10 i understand how this would be done but i dont understand why this happens as this would imply that there are actually two different objects with two different values i know both constructors would run but i dont get how this is stored in memory are there actually two separate objects created in memory
student,is the scope resolution operator only needed with member functions and constants outside of the header file
student,if anybody interested in a small study group for the final hit me up jyishimwumichedu
student,is a semicolon needed after the bracket in an initializer list code using one seems to compile either way thanks
student,hello in this part of the problem we are calling a aobj i believe we would get an error because one of the member functions in a remains unimplemented as a virtual function to be implemented in its derived types b and c therefore a is a an abstract type is this the correct logic thanks
student,if we go to office hours to get solutions to practice exam problems do we have to rerequest help every time we want to verify our solution or do we get a sheet with the solutions on it
student,startteststarttestint numels data new doublenumels im a little confused by this shouldnt data be a pointer
student,for the following code template typename t listtlistconst list other frontptr0 backptr0 pushallother why does the argument listconst list other not listconst listt other
student,template typename t bool collectort hasseenconst t item const i understand that collector is a templated list that has the function hasseen in it which takes in another list as a const
student,how do we know when we need to put typename in our code like in w15 3a im pretty sure vidal was saying that the for loop should be for typename listtiterator i itemsbeginetc and i just wasnt exactly sure when we need to include that typename or not is that something we will be marked down on on the exam
student,i have an array of isosceles triangles and i populate it like this isosceles meshsize mesh0 isosceles34 isosceles is derived from triangle when i run the second line of code the output is triangle custom ctor isosceles custom dtor isosceles default dtor triangle default dtor despite there being remaining cout statements in main function the array hasnt gone out of scope yet at the very end the custom dtors are called in the order i would expect size times could someone help me understand what is being destroyed in the above code and where it is being destroyed
student,from the final exam review question in which it has you implement a countif function that takes in a functor and two iterators how do you make an iterator argument that doesnt specify the type of iterator will be would it be by using templating such as template typename u templatetypename predicate void countiftypename uiterator begin typename uiterator end predicate pred
student,i have some array myclass a new myclass3 this calls the myclass default constructor three times but doesnt call the deconstructor at all how is this possible
student,would the basebooltrue and the derivedint58 be leaked in addition to the two derrived strings i went to the review session and i believe they said the two derived strings were leaked but i do not see why the other two objects would not be leaked as well
student,what does it mean to have c ptr new c1 is c an array
student,a few questions regarding abstract base classes 1 why is it that abstract base classes cant have private member variables 2 can abstract base classes have constructors and destructors
student,i am very confused about destructors i know it is always said that the destructor runs when the dynamic memory goes out of scope but that is a little unclear and it seems like there are a million exceptions to this rule can someone please give a clearer explanation thanks
student,i noticed that in the input there is not a termination command like ctrl d so would the program stuck at the line of cin n
student,the implementation of the ninjallama constructor is stated as ninjallamastring name int spitdist superllamaname spitdist cout ninjallama ctor endl question i understand that due to inheritance when the constructor of the derived class ninjallama is run the constructor of the base classsuperllama is run first then the derived class constructor is run my question is why doesnt superllama ctor print twice since the superllama constructor is run once due to it being the base class and then it would print again since the ninjallama constructor calls the superllama constructor
student,int main car a new car6 using a car class for this example it could be any class car ba in the example above i know that the copy constructor is run in line two when i state car ba but is car b located on the stack or the heap is it simply copying a from its location on the heap and putting car b on the stack
student,if there is a function that is defined as void filter listguest guestlist listguest viplist bool isvip const lord implementation doesnt matter for this question how do i call the function isvip in the filter function
student,in this question wouldnt you need to change two lines of code to make it an abstract base class both the constructor and area
student,when you have dynamic variables so theyre stored in the heap not the stack and you pass them by value into a function what happens i know a copy of the variable is created but is that copy stored in the heap or the stack and do you need a destructor so that when the function ends the variable is destroyed
student,is this valid int arr new int4 for int i 0 i 4 i arri 3 my thinking is that its not valid because int arr is an integer pointer to the first element of the dynamic array therefore you cant index arr to fill the dynamic array arr points to you would have to do i 3 i i 4 and so on
student,when using dynamic memory if i do not use a pointer to dynamic memory will that cause undefined behavior for example would this cause undefined behavior ptr new double32 ptr2 ptr1
student,since the output of the line in main steveprintdescription doesnt contain i am a ninjallama am i correct in assuming that the superllamaprintdescription function in the base class superllama is not virtual since the its derived class ninjallama cannot override it with its own function definition or is there another reason the second cout statement in ninjallamaprintdescription is failing to execute
student,why does myclass x z call the copy constructor didnt understand why in class is this something the compiler does implicitly
student,my question is 1 if n 0 throw negativeerror 2 if n 0 negativeerror e throw e which one is preferred the second one makes more sense to me because you are throwing a variable e of type nagative error could someone please explain the first one in greater detail how can i understand negativeerror is the default constructor called i have not seen negativeerror with empty parenthesis beside a custom type
student,i typed some code wrong and dont want people thinking im a loser
student,when should representation invariants hold true should it be the course of an objects lifetime ie constructor to destructor or just in member functions thanks
student,in an interface class if the derived classes have data members that will be created dynamically do you have to create pure virtual destructors copy constructors and overloaded assignment operators also the lecture slides says that an interface class doesnt have a constructor this makes sense from the perspective that the interface only class cannot be instantiated but wouldnt all derived classes call the base class constructor does this mean that it is default created for you
student,i was looking over this unit and i noticed that an example of a derived class is isosceles public triangle im wondering where exactly did public come from it has nothing to do with public and private within classes so thank you
student,i created a class isagen that takes in an int on construction and then compares the said int with an operator overloaded bool comparator const person a but when i try to compile it says error pred cannot be used as a function when compiling on xcode it says that bool is not a function or function pointer but my code does basically the same thing as the other functors we need to make and they work am i doing something wrong
student,is it true that a base class can catch something thrown by its derived class but not vice versa
student,to be adt is that were you need at least 1 virtual function or was it at least 1 pure virtual function or is it something else where thats the requirement also for polymorphism is it the same thing
student,so since for 5a unhandled exception is printed so this means after throw derivedstrings executes the function returns and then its caught in main aka after derivedstrings is thrown this function returns and thus does not go to the caught something catch in the same function correct
student,i was wondering whether it is generally good practice to take care of exception handling in functions or classes called from the main function or whether its okay to do exception handling in the main function obviously c allows both but i was curious as to whats considered good practice
student,im having trouble visualizing how this one is supposed to work is it essentially just flipping the direction of the next pointers or does it swaptrade nodes around in some special order if someone could explain the general algorithm and how node prev nodecurrent and node next assist in the reversal that would be great thanks
student,when is it appropriate to declare a constructor like this classnameclassnameint membervarin membervarmembervarin versus classnameint membervarin membervarmembervarin thank you
student,in deorios lecture 16 roughly 3600 the code below is displayed he mentions that in the getzeroarray function the value returned is the 3rd created element in the array because it has the lowest address i still dont understand how its assigned the lowest address value doesnt the first created element get assigned the lowest address any clarification would be appreciated effects allocates an array of specified size and initializes each element to zero int getzeroarrayint size int arraysize for int i0 isize i arrayi 0 return array int main int a getzeroarray3 cout a0 endl
student,i understand that the ouput i hello world goodbye helloerror main returns but i dont understand why done doesnt print as well
student,i was looking at the slides for memory models and noticed that there is a bit in the end on polymorphism and destructors but i dont remember it being taught in lecture is this information we should know for the exam
student,im looking at a solution for 2a implement the print function and im confused about a couple things first i have it doing n n next to move to the next node but is this one of the scenarios where we should us nnext to be safe also im confused as to why iterators are not used for this problem including 2b in one solution there is a while loop and in another i have for node n first n n n next why does a regular for loop work her and not an iterator is an iterator a possible solution too thanks
student,the first question asks for the output of this program but im a little confused for example in the main program a new c object is created so naturally the base classes constructor will be called first then the derived classes constructor note ive ran this in xcode and this is the output a ctor c ctor a ctor b ctor b dtor a dtor what i dont understand is why in the third line as constructor is being called again if someone could explain this it would be great
student,what do we need to know about static variables and functions thanks
student,is the non default constructor declared the same as the default except it has parameters like default could be myconmycon numelements0 and the nondefault could be right below it as say myconmyconparameter numelementsparameters thanks
student,i remember class static variable are created when the first instance is created but when we create the first instance if the initializer list set a member variable to the static variable will this cause undefined behavior
student,when we are asked to cross off deleted memory blocks we certainly need to cross of any dynamic variables that have been deleted but do we need to cross off all local variables on stack at the end of the program
student,hello everyone can there be a try block inside a catch block if so where would the corresponding catch blocks have to be inside that catch block thanks in advance
student,just wonder if we can use auto keyword when creating a for loop for iterator
student,you have an isosceles class that is derived from a triangle each class has a void function that couts the name of the type eg it is a triangle or it is an isosceles if i have a triangle pointer and it points to an isosceles it will print it is a triangle if my print type function is not virtual but it will print it is a triangle it is isosceles if the function is virtual why is that
student,why is the string in printdescription i am a ninjallama not got output
student,shoutout to the entire eecs 280 staff for being amazing and awesome this semester
student,the final exam announcement says the coverage of the final is lecture 10 and onwards but 3103 says its cumulative what should we expect for the final
student,im looking back at lab 8 and wondering about constructors the default constructor for one thing is intvectorintvector numelements0 would this be the same as intvectorintvector numelements 0 or if you were just in the class youre declaring would it be class intvector public intvector numelements 0 for that matter whats the point of declaring implementing the constructor outside of the class thanks
student,in lecture 22 it says that unlike values types and functions are not firstclass objects i understand that functions are not but why type ex int or struct is a type and they are firstclass objects
student,i wanted to confirm if i understand the concept correctly in terms of the gorilla example in lecture listgorilla creates not only gorilla objects but also the nodes of gorilla pointers on the heap correct after list gets destroyed it only deletes the nodes of gorilla and not the gorilla objects if so gorilla objects need to be manually deleted in the scope its called main etc
student,while reviewing the lecture i saw that not all derived type is a subtype could anyone explain and give an example for this case thanks
student,can someone help me with these errors in stackh stackh in instantiation of ‘t stacktpop with t int’ stackpublictestcpp183 required from here stackh5228 error invalid use of member function did you forget the ‘’ listpopfront stackh in instantiation of ‘int stacktcountifpredicate const with predicate bool int t int’ stackpublictestcpp563 required from here stackh9927 error ‘countduplicates’ was not declared in this scope
student,in task 1 cmp my my name functor when i try to do inside main cout the last person alphabetically is findmaxpeople5cmp endl i get a compiler error error 1 error c2679 binary no operator found which takes a righthand operand of type person or there is no acceptable conversion i ran this in caen and got the same compiler error whats the problem thanks
student,do we need to write assert in calc to make sure the stack satisfies the function requirements
student,hello i have been having issues with submitting some of my listtestcpp files i have them named the proper way and they compile when i use putty to access my caen terminal however they still fail to compile in the autograder any help would be appreciated thanks
student,when someone enters the a or p command to print the elements in the stack should it print the element followed by a space or should it only print the elements without any trailing space
student,should and throw a null pointer error if they are passed end should work on begin and move it to a null pointer
student,i have zero valgrind errors and the makefile compiles the tests but the auto grader still does not compile them really unsure what else i can do
student,will the solutions to the exam practice problems for lecture 1516 ever be posted i wasnt able to make it to the review session thanks
student,do we need to check the requires clause using assert for erase and insert there is the part of the requires clause that states that i must be an iterator associated with the list should we iterate through the list to make sure the iterator is associated with the list or can we assume the requires clause will be true for all tests any help would be really appreciated
student,i keep getting a compiler error that says that t is out of scope in my countif function implementation on the first line heres how my countif is structured template typename predicate int stacktcountifpredicate pred const and heres the error do i need to add a template typename t before my function or something i already put typename in front of listtiterator as well
student,how do i use v in valgrind to detect errors i have 0 bytes of memory used at exit but valgrind is still giving me 1 error so none of my test cases are compiling
student,im trying to make sure that everything is valgrind clean ive tested everything and im not getting any errors or memory leaks and ive passed the autograder tests but is there anything else i can do to make sure im completely valgrind clean thanks
student,why doesnt this line of code work when trying to feed isagen into the identify function cout the people who are age 16 are n identifypeople5isagen16

student,say ive got nodeynodeptr that i want t eliminate from my list i know that i need to delete it with the delete keyword do i also need to say nodeynodeptr 0 is there anything wrong with doing this so far ive been doing something along these lines to get my size function to have the expected behavior thanks
student,we are having trouble double deleting a copied list that is point to the same node is the heap after the first list is deleted the second list is still pointing to the heap and it runs the destructor without knowing that the content is already deleted by the first list
student,if my in use at exit memory 0 and total errors are zero but total heap usage 56 allocs 56 frees 1403 bytes allocated is this why im having a problem or is that expected
student,is it okay to leave assert statements in our list file for checking for the requires clause or should we remove them thanks
student,when i run listcompilecheck it fails because it says the operators used to compare the iterators are private listcompilecheck compares iterators in its main function how do i make it so it doesnt throw an error when using the iterator operators
student,after running insert on an empty listwith an iterator pointed at the beginning of the list should the iterator somehow be adjusted to point to the new node my intuition tells me no since the iterator is being passed by value into the function
student,if someone just enters a bunch of numbers in the calculator without anything after what should the calculator do should it add the numbers to the stack
student,do we need to submit listteststarter if we didnt change it
student,im failing calc test 00 and calc test 01 because of an extra space i piped the output into a file and diff checked it with the correct solution and everything is the same except for there being 2 spaces on the end compared to one in the correct solution i believe im iterating through my stack correctly is there is only one space in the quotations for the print function
student,i get a floating point exception from calc when i try expressions such as 1 0 i think everything else works does anyone know what might be wrong something i overlooked
student,i have an issue where all of my test cases involving iterator are not compiling in the autograder they all compile and pass with the makefile i read that a possible problem could be due to a friend statement i made in the iterator class but i am not sure how to fix this i made this declaration in the commented section that says add friend stuff here im struggling to find the issue any help would be great
student,can we not test with rationals in our list tests im getting undefined reference errors even though i included rationalh
student,are we allow to overload the operator to overwrite the shallow copy if so where can i implement this overload if i cant add it to the public interface
student,i can compile them in the g auto grader but they dil to compile in the auto grader the makefile also does not work what is my problem
student,what is the point of having multiple files for the test cases rather than just testing them all in separate functions within the same file
student,for example in the list starter file the only public method of iterator is operator so should we submit tests for and will there be such methods when testing out test cases
student,when i run make test for all my test cases in caen it compiles with no valgrind errors however im getting a compilation error for several files in autograder the only difference my partner and i can find between the compiling and noncompiling test files is that the ones that fail include the operator for iterators why would this happen if it is not an issue in caen
student,in the match function we need to compare the first element with the rest but it looks like pred can only take in one parameter as input how can i change the value that pred is comparing all the elements in stack to from time to time
student,can someone help explain some of these errors in my stackh bash42 g wall werror g pedantic stackh stackpublictestcpp stackh839 error ‘ostream’ does not name a type friend ostream operatorstdostream os const stacku obj stackh13516 error expected ‘’ before ‘i’ for iterator i listbegin i listempty i stackh13534 error ‘i’ was not declared in this scope for iterator i listbegin i listempty i
student,since the functions front and back return references to the elements in the list it is my understanding that the following should work listint l lpushfront7 int check lfront check 5 assertlfront check however when testing the assertion fails is my implementation for front incorrect or is this supposed to fail if it is supposed to fail could someone explain why that is the case i am having a difficult time trying to understanding why this is behaving the way it is thanks
student,
student,when i try to use the makefile for my test cases the terminal reads nothing can be done for listtestequalto is this a problem will it affect our final grade how can i fix this
student,hello everything is working and i have a 55 however two of my list tests that test insert and erase are failing to compile on the autograder they are valgrind clean and compile fine on caen thanks
student,can you use insert if the iterator you send it is listend i think it would be yes since that is an iterator associated with the list even though it would be a null pointer thanks
student,since make listtests complies runs and uses valgrind on our code can we assume valgrind will catch any memory leaks when our test cases are graded so since we have no way to assert if there is a memory leak we just have to make sure to test the possibility knowing that valgrind will catch it
student,in this class since we included a custom constructor and default constructor do we need to add the big 3
student,does 0 1 0 or 0 does 1 0 0 or 0 is 0 0
student,i keep getting these errors when trying to test rational in a main function ive used include rationalh but for some reason its not working my code looks like exactly like this rational r rational assertrgetnumerator 0 rgetdenominator 1 in function main sandboxcpptext0x10 undefined reference to rationalrational sandboxcpptext0x1c undefined reference to rationalgetnumerator const sandboxcpptext0x2c undefined reference to rationalgetdenominator const sandboxcpptext0x60 undefined reference to rationalrationalint int collect2 error ld returned 1 exit status any ideas
student,if i have infinity infinity or undefined undefined what output should i give it makes more sense to be 0 but just to confirm
student,in calccpp when you have to print all and the stack is empty do you still have to create a newline even though it isnt printing anything
student,just finding out why im failing listcompilecheck since this test case is asking us to check on two nonreferencable iterators im assuming that for our iterator operators we dont have to and shouldnt use an assertnodeptr or assertiteratornodeptr right
student,in the functor lecture the class greater2 is defined then to use the functor we did this greater2 g2 declared instance of class greater2 cout g24 endl call overloaded operator in the lab im trying to create an object of type comparepersonname so i can use the overloaded but it wont let me create the instance of comparepersonname syntactically im trying comparepersonname a the compiler says it wants a after comparepersonname i think thats because its getting confused between me trying to create an instance of comparepersonname class and calling the comparepersonname function declared in the person class how can i fix this so i can use my comparepersonname functor
student,im not valgrind clean on any of my test cases until i call my list destructor so since the compile check doesnt call the destructor should i be valgrind clean on that
student,im passing the autograder tests and many of my own but when i use a diff checker website to compare the correct output for calc tests 00 and 01 and copypasted code of my output from the terminal it says im missing spaces at the end of every line i print though nothing else is different could this just be an error with copypasting from the terminal is there a way to simultaneously pipe in an input file and pipe output to a file so i can compare them with diff in the terminal
student,i am not sure how to initialize a empty stack for assignment constructor for stack can i do stack const stackt other list
student,could someone give me some ideas or advices about how to debugging on project5 any stepbystep guide or check list would be very helpful
student,very quick question does the note mean that scores of cardtestxx or playertestxx which you came up with on the autograder can possibly be changed later that cardtestscpp and playertestscpp which we submitted did not appear on the autograder on purpose and they will be handgraded 1 or 2 thank you
student,i got this error message caused by stack copy constructor what does it mean
student,when i compile and run the stackpublictest it comes up with an error message free invalid next size fast with a whole lot of information about memory im not sure what this error code means heres the entire error message error in stackpublictest free invalid next size fast 0x0000000001c28010 backtrace lib64libcso60x7d1fd0x7fac782171fd stackpublictest0x4011e7 lib64libcso6libcstartmain0xf50x7fac781bbaf5 stackpublictest0x400a19 memory map 0040000000402000 rxp 00000000 0028 697863248 homeasvoggeecs280project5stackpublictest 0060100000602000 rp 00001000 0028 697863248 homeasvoggeecs280project5stackpublictest 0060200000603000 rwp 00002000 0028 697863248 homeasvoggeecs280project5stackpublictest 01c2800001c49000 rwp 00000000 0000 0 heap 7fac7819a0007fac78350000 rxp 00000000 fd01 7602863 usrlib64libc217so 7fac783500007fac78550000 p 001b6000 fd01 7602863 usrlib64libc217so 7fac785500007fac78554000 rp 001b6000 fd01 7602863 usrlib64libc217so 7fac785540007fac78556000 rwp 001ba000 fd01 7602863 usrlib64libc217so 7fac785560007fac7855b000 rwp 00000000 0000 0 7fac7855b0007fac78570000 rxp 00000000 fd01 7602191 usrlib64libgccs48320140911so1 7fac785700007fac7876f000 p 00015000 fd01 7602191 usrlib64libgccs48320140911so1 7fac7876f0007fac78770000 rp 00014000 fd01 7602191 usrlib64libgccs48320140911so1 7fac787700007fac78771000 rwp 00015000 fd01 7602191 usrlib64libgccs48320140911so1 7fac787710007fac78872000 rxp 00000000 fd01 7602871 usrlib64libm217so 7fac788720007fac78a71000 p 00101000 fd01 7602871 usrlib64libm217so 7fac78a710007fac78a72000 rp 00100000 fd01 7602871 usrlib64libm217so 7fac78a720007fac78a73000 rwp 00101000 fd01 7602871 usrlib64libm217so 7fac78a730007fac78b5c000 rxp 00000000 fd01 7602911 usrlib64libstdcso6019 7fac78b5c0007fac78d5b000 p 000e9000 fd01 7602911 usrlib64libstdcso6019 7fac78d5b0007fac78d63000 rp 000e8000 fd01 7602911 usrlib64libstdcso6019 7fac78d630007fac78d65000 rwp 000f0000 fd01 7602911 usrlib64libstdcso6019 7fac78d650007fac78d7a000 rwp 00000000 0000 0 7fac78d7a0007fac78d9b000 rxp 00000000 fd01 7602856 usrlib64ld217so 7fac78f710007fac78f76000 rwp 00000000 0000 0 7fac78f980007fac78f9b000 rwp 00000000 0000 0 7fac78f9b0007fac78f9c000 rp 00021000 fd01 7602856 usrlib64ld217so 7fac78f9c0007fac78f9d000 rwp 00022000 fd01 7602856 usrlib64ld217so 7fac78f9d0007fac78f9e000 rwp 00000000 0000 0 7ffd7a9c60007ffd7a9e7000 rwp 00000000 0000 0 stack 7ffd7a9f60007ffd7a9f8000 rxp 00000000 0000 0 vdso ffffffffff600000ffffffffff601000 rxp 00000000 0000 0 vsyscall aborted
student,hi i searched through the piazza posts about this but i didnt find anything that answered my question could somebody please explain why the return code for some of the euchre tests on the autograder would be incorrect while others have the correct return codecorrect output i just want to understand what kind of issues would cause this to happen thank you
student,i added a friend function to stack in order to clear it when running calc does this count as changing the public interface of stack even though the function is not in the stack class
student,in the spec it says we cannot use cstrings or any of its related libraries however people have been suggesting here that we can use these so im a bit confused anyone care to clarify
student,i have declared friend ostream operatorstdostream os const stacku obj in my stackh class and it will not compile what am i doing wrong
student,ive read all the pizza posts about this but am still having segfaulting when trying to insert into an empty list when i set a break in gdb i get this just before the error breakpoint 1 0x000000000040123c in listintinsert this0x7fffffffe3f0 i datum0x7fffffffe410 42 at listh189 189 ifinodeptrprev gdb the problem is trying to dereference the node pointer to determine where it is in the list i know you cant dereference a null pointer but im lost on how else to do this also does i mean its a null pointer floating around in memory
student,can you have an iterator pointing to an empty list if so would begin and end be both pointing to that spot
student,our school didnt go up at all the second time and is still very low could this be a mistake what was the average grade thanks
student,i just wanted to check my understanding was correct rational r0 0 should give a rational number 00 rational r14 0 should evaluate to 10
student,i used for typename listtiterator i listbegin i listend i for my countif function but it does not do the pred for the last element in the list how can i fix this
student,i went with the assumption that its supposed to be the in the context of dereferencing example iter 3 but do we also have to have code for this scenario iter address
student,hi i dont exactly know what im misinterpreting but the code below which is part of listcompilecheck appears to give me a null pointer for iter which in turn gives me a seg fault for when i try to insert am i misunderstanding something mylistpushfront42 mylistpushback42 mylistfront mylistback mylistpopfront mylistpopback listint list2mylist list2 mylist listintiterator iter mylistbegin mylistinsertiter 42
student,in my begin function in listh after i use insert one time and then try to use it again with begin begin says it cannot read the memory from first i assigned first to the first time i used insert since i inserted at the start of the list why is my memory from first not being assigned correctly
student,if hypothetically a friend of mine failed some of the autograder tests and they wanted to know what their bugs were now that the project is over and scores have been released plus i looked at their code during the peer review could i run their code against my test cases just want to verify that its not an honor code violation
student,are we expected to test assert with everything for stuff such as push pop erase insert etc my current tests didnt fully utilize assert i now realize
student,so im a little bit confused on functors in project 5 and i just want to make im on the right track the way i understand it the countif function in stackh simply takes in some object called pred and we use the template mechanism with typename predicate to act as a sort of placeholder for the undermined type of pred no additional classes or anything need to be implemented here besides the function body the functor classes would be implemented in calccpp and could then take advantage of the template mechanism to be passed as pred regardless of what their type is is this correct or is there some sort of additional class inside of stackh that i need to implement
student,for some time my submission has been placed on queued has this happened to anyone else
student,quick question about style for project 5 all of the code given to us is indented by two spaces but when i code i indent with a tab is it okay if my indentation differs throughout orr do i need to change everything to one of the two
student,just wanted to check that undefined 00 infinity 10 is undefined 00
student,after reading the announcements i went back to look at the autograder to see if any of the points we lost were from the test cases but only project1 and project5 appear to be up is anyone else having an issue
student,i have been trying to fix the bug forever now and i have no idea what may be going on after seemingly looking at everything that may be involved to explain the situation the following code compiles for me make a list l of 3 nodes using pushback make to iterators it1 begin it2 end assertit2 it1 assertit1 it2 assertbegin end any idea on what is wrong i dont understand how it1 and it2 could be pointing to the same place but then when dereferenced give different values
student,4 other people and i as far as i know so far are failing almost all project 4 autograder test cases compiler error despite completely unrelated code implementations we are all getting 1785 is any staff member awake to quickly check on this to relieve our nerves and put to sleep
student,i am looking at my grade for project 4 and notice i failed a fair amount of test cases due to compilation errors i am curious as to why this is so as my project compiled in caen and even passed some of the test cases one error ive identified in my code is forgetting to delete the players at the end of the program thus making me not valgrind clean however if this was the reason for failure then i would have failed all the test cases whereas i was able to pass a few of them furthermore my code should still compile even with memory leaks ive talked with a few other students who are getting errors in the same test cases if an instructor could clarify the reasoning for this or a time where i can meet to go over this more in depth i would greatly appreciate it thank you for the time youve given this semester
student,the rme for getnumerator is effects returns numerator that is consistent with the invariants do i need to recheck the invariants in this function if i had already checked them in the constructor i feel that checking them again here would be inefficient
student,what was the average
student,my stacksize value is off by one in calccpp showing size 0 after first push but works just fine in my stack tests size 1 after first push im using a helping function in calc to push and im passing the stack by reference why would this happen
student,cardtest05 compilation success your program exceeded the time limit and was terminated however our program passed other cardtests and i remembered that some one said eecs280 doesnt care about efficiency thanks
student,in the spec it says that r0 should equal 01 or 0 does that mean that we should account for if there is a 0 as input in our rational custom constructor because a gsi was saying 0 would never be in the input file and when you negate 0 you would just get 01 which would equal 0
student,hello my partner and i have been having some issues with trying to use liststring for test cases for some reason the compiler keeps telling us that string was not declared in this scope we have include string at the top of both listh and our listtestcpp file any help would be appreciated thanks
student,im trying to compare rationals that should be undefined 10 10 00 etc but my compiler keeps giving me a floating point error for dividing by 0 according to the spec we need to write it out that way though not really sure how to reconcile this and how exactly would returning undefined take place anyway
student,dear instructors i understand that after you call erase with an iterator i as input it is not longer valid and deference i am assuming that after erasing you cannot i and erase other nodes and do we have to anything else with that invalidated iterator just let it remain invalidated thank you very much
student,if i run calccpp and enter 1 2 3 a the output would be 3 2 1 just want to double check that this is correct behavior
student,anyone know what might be causing us to get a seg fault anytime we try any of the operations in calccpp if the number on the stack is greater or equal to 7
student,so my compiler gives me errors when my function definition matches the function declaration it then doesnt give me errors when they dont match why int countifpredicate pred const int countifpredicate pred const the above gives me errors the below does not int countifpredicate pred const int countifpredicate pred
student,im confused as to the output for the last two lines of calctest01 for the input 4 1 0 1000000 d d d d d d d d d a why is the correct output 14 instead of just 14 also why is there a 4 printed on the last line
student,i understand that the deference returns by reference inside each node i tried doing this cout i endl but the value of the datum did not get printed out in standard output when testing why is it because we are returning by ref thank you
student,im really not sure why calccpp cant find that declaration for countif in stackh i have include stackh in calccpp
student,repost i made a mistake thinking that i solved it so in rationalcpp i have written my own static helper functions but i found out that i cannot use one in another ex gcf in checkinvariants is there a way to bypass this
student,i am trying to make the new first elements next point to the old first element in pushfront function
student,in my project i have pretty much the exact code from this lecture slide but i dont understand how its bad and why its giving me an error in xcode the error im getting is pointer being freed was not allocated the way i understand it is the code makes a node pointer to the node that is going to be deleted and then moves the first pointer to the node thats next to it and then deletes the node once there is one node left and its called to be deleted the first pointer will be null then itll delete the last node and wont be called again in the slides it says to delete zoofirst but i dont understand because isnt that deleting a potential int and thus not allowed this issue has been my bottleneck for the past few hours with regards to the project so any help is much appreciated
student,so all of my tests for list yield no memory leaks when i run stackpublictest with valgrind i get a still reachable leak the curious thing is that i commented out tests to try and figure out where it is coming from even after commenting out all of test calls it still has the same issue how does that work
student,one of my listtest functions compiles and runs correctly on my computer and on caen but shows up as a compilation error on the autograder anything i can check for why this might be happening
student,my test cases compile in visual studio but not in caen what is wrong
student,could someone clarify the differences between having a plain derived class and polymorphic types this is what i am understanding from the lectures derived polymorphic type known at run time type not known at runtime function overrides virtual functions i understand that polymorphism works with derived classes but would just like some additional clarification for example are virtual functions only for dynamic types why cant you just use an override to accomplish the same function thanks
student,if we have a valgrind error should we be passing the autograder we are getting a valgrind error when we do make test but when i run the test separately it comes out clean and passes the autograder
student,do we need a default iterator constructor i dont believe so because we only use iterators really in loops and define them to a node ptr right away so it can go through the list well
student,can we assign an empty list into a nonempty list for testing the assert is front is listh is not allowing me to do that may i know why thank you for the clarification
student,error nonmember function ‘int countifpredicate’ cannot have cvqualifier int countifpredicate pred const error ‘list’ was not declared in this scope fortypename listpredicateiterator i listbegin i am so very confused as to why im getting these errors by the way in the first error the compiler is having a problem with const dont ask me why and im pretty sure the compiler error was supposed to be fixed with typename but its not so whats going on in this second compiler error
student,if we print something like passed test at the end of one of our test files will that matter when it goes through the autograder cases
student,im trying to think of how i can iterate through my stack for the match case the thing is im not sure how to do this because i dont think i can access the private member variable list from stack i could initialize an iterator with listbegin but i cant access list so how am i supposed to iterate through a stack to check to see if certain numbers are the same elements
student,so pretty much whenever i call delete im getting unexpected results for a long time i thought it was working but stepping through more carefully reveals that it is setting the victim 0 after the delete that is doing all of the work for me lets say i call delete on a node pointer ndptr after ndptr has been set equal to firstptr so something like ndptr firstptr delete ndptr shouldnt this set all of the addresses and values of all the elements in ndptr and firstptr to null if not why not thanks so much
student,when returning a reference is the value being returned to an address that we need to dereference for the function front in listh when we return datum the compiler really does not like it but returning just a value seems to work fine are we totally off here tanks
student,when testing i started to think about it more and wanted to check if we should be checking to see if the datums of two iterators are equal or if they are pointing to the exact same node
student,i first create an object of my functor and then try to call stackcountif using this object as the predicate input for some reason im getting the error no matching function for call to stackrationalcountifmainequaliterator equaliterator is my functor thoughts thank you
student,my partner and i submitted our test cases and on one of them got this response from the autograder the following files were discarded due to being unnecessary listtestoperatorcpp can anyone explain thanks
student,i just ran into a question about moving backwards from the null pointer so if i declared an iterator to the end of the list listintiterator i mylistend is this a valid command i thanks
student,can we test lists of type double or we should stick with int
student,is the review seesion on saturday just in dow on the first floor i checked the calendar on ctools but it just says the location is tbd
student,am i allowed to add private functions to stackh the comment says to not make any changes to the private section but i dont see an issue with adding a private function the functions i added were copyall and popall their purpose is to eliminate code duplication the same purpose as the listh copyall and popall functions
student,what does this error mean i am trying to delete a victim in one of my list member functions but sometimes xcode throws this error when it does this however my debugger shows a reasonable address value contained inside of victim so it seems like it ishas been allocated how can i be getting this error when my victim has a normal address value
student,when i try to write assignment operator for rational class i get an error like this rational operatorconst rational const rational’ must be a nonstatic member function rational operator const rational lhs const rational rhs any idea of why is it so
student,hi lets say were iterating through a list using a for loop with iterators and then we use the erase function midloop should we be able to continue iterating through that list after erasing an element
student,the instructors said to blindly follow the formulas given in the spec in this case would infinity 1 still be infinity
student,my code works properly on putty it compiles and passes make test when sent to the autograder i am given an exceeded the time limit error and two of my listtest files do not compile i do not have any infinite loops when compiling in linux and all of my test cases compile and run correctly i have no valgrind errors on linux any ideas
student,what is a bus error
student,so why do we not have the big three for an iterator for a list what goes on behind the scenes i was going through the lectures and this question came up
student,i have passed all the autograder tests and i am valgrind clean on all my test files and the stack public test but for some reason when i run the listcompilecheck with valgrind i am not valgrind clean is this a problem
student,does the template typename t at the beginning of listh mean we dont need to type it at the beginning of each function implementation if so this is only because we are implementing the functions in the h file instead of the cpp file right thanks
student,do the big 3 need rmes thanks
student,hi i have read other peoples posts but i cannot figure out what i have done incorrectly in writing pushfront i make a new node set the datum set the next to the first pointer which at this point is null then i try to set first to this new node and this line gives me a segmentation fault i am not dereferencing first so i dont know what is wrong with this can i just not set a null pointer to point to anything else once it has been set to null very confused
student,what should infinityinfinity be would it also be infinity i know the other operations would make it undefined but i think this one is different
student,one of my test cases is not compiling on the autograder even though it runs fine on caen what am i missing
student,do you want us to comment all of our test files even if we have 20
student,is it allowed to use enum in calccpp if so should it be defined static just like other helper functions can it be static at all
student,i get an error when i try to set lastnext equal to null or 0 this is after i made last the prev of the original last any ideas why this doesnt work i wrote it out but for some reason im getting an unhandled exception
student,why does throw 20 match to catch int d instead of catch int n isnt catch int n the first matching catch block
student,our files are compiling fine on caen using makefile but they are failing the compilation on the autograder ive tried everything recommended in the other posts but it still isnt compiling on the autograder did anyone figure out this problem
student,my listh is valgrind clean but when i run stack i get quite a bit of leakage i dont create any new variables in stack any idea where this could be coming from
student,so when i try to try my test files on caen using make it says permission denied what does this mean
student,im confused because im getting valgrind errors even on a test file where i dont do anything except declare an empty list which means i havent allocated dynamic memory so how could i possibly have a memory leak
student,in my calculator every time i pop elements from the stack i get an extra 0 in the stack that isnt supposed to be there i assume its stemming from me setting poitners to 0 after i delete them but since i am supposed to do this how do i get rid of the extra 0
student,so im receiving a seg fault when trying to test stackh when i ran it through gdb it says the segfault is occurring in listh in pushback but the only time i could think of stack using push back is when im creating a temp list the error message says there is an error reading variable i am unsure how there can be an error reading a variable if im making a copy anyone else getting this issue
student,do we need to write rme for a class functor that we defined in the calccpp or we can just briefly describe what it does thanks
student,our rational operators are getting linker errors and i cant figure out why anyone have any advice
student,valgrind is telling us all heap blocks were freed no leaks are possible but before that its also listing all this stuff like invalid read of size 8 should we worry about these or just the memory leaks as the specs suggest thank you
student,just to make sure that we can build this stack either way from bottom to top or from top to bottom
student,when i try compiling using make test i get the error make execvp runmytestspy permission denied followed by listtests error 127 what does this mean
student,when i make stackpublictest and run it it works fine but when i put my files into the autograder it says i have a compilation error how do i fix this
student,in professor deorios lecture on polymorphism im a little confused about one of his slides his slide says if s is a subtype of t then objects of type t may be replaced with objects of type s without altering any of the desirable properties of that program correctness should it instead say if s is a subtype of t then objects of type s may be replaced with objects of type t without altering any of the desirable properties of that program because if s is isosceles and t is triangle since s is a t then s can be replaced with t the other way around would not work since a t isnt necessarily an s or am i thinking about this backwards
student,the listtest files that i submitted to the autograder all work when i compile in caen however when i submit them they all result in compilation failure what are the possible reasons for this
student,in testio in rationalpublictest rational r24 prints out as 12 when i do cout r and when it goes into readall result is returned as 12 as a string yet it is failing the assert statement that stringr 12 any ideas on whats going wrong here
student,im trying to write calccpp with helper functions for the different operators right now but am getting the error stack is not a type heres an example of one of my functions void reversestring value stack calculator code in my main i have created a stack of rationals called calculator i have also included all of the header files i cant quite put my finger on the problem and internet searches havent really helped any assistance is appreciated thanks
student,i dont know if im missing something but i know the main rule for the big three is that if you need one you need all three in an example like lab11 there was dynamic memory allocated and the abstract base class had to have a destructor did this not mean we need the other two functions too or is it a different rule when it comes to polymorphism because i realize that the end of main we delete the pointers via iterator i apologize if the question was kind of vague and confusing
student,say we create a stack stack s spush1 spush2 spush3 if we choose the start of the list to be the top it should look like this 1 2 3 start end so stop 1 spop removes 1 right or is the top actually 3 in this case
student,the spec states rational r another way to create the rational number with value 0 but when i try to construct a rational object in that exact way it will not allow me to compare it to other rational objects the error states that there is no operator for types rational and rational note the difference in type is the spec a typo i would think you could just declare rational r to call the default constructor when i do this no errors are thrown
student,the spec says to receive full credit your test cases must return 0 from main when linked with a correct solution and at least one of your test files must return nonzero per incorrect solution can someone clarify what this means i am using assert in all of my test files but not sure if this will satisfy this statement
student,is it fair to assume that if the list is empty in a correctly implemented list that both first and last pointers are 0
student,hi i know there have been many posts about these kinds of issues and i followed all of the instructions on the note about failing to compile our program runs without error using both commands make test and make rationalpublictest from the unmodified makefile on the caen environment we have redownloaded rationalh we are valgrind clean and have also used the valgrind command toolexpsgcheck that is recommended in other piazza posts however autograder still says that rationalpublictest fails to compile were not sure how to proceed forward because we dont have any issues on our own on the caen environment and autograder says everything else compiles any helpideas would be appreciated
student,in calccpp when i declare a new stack by saying stackt s stack it says that t was not declared in the scope do i have to write template typename t somewhere in calccpp before the main function
student,im failing the last assert in the operators test which is assertrational1 r2 rational4 the thing thats different about this one is that it calls the rational constructor with 1 input so i would think it would have to do with that but i looked it over and tested it with a bunch of couts and it seems to be working anyone have an idea of whats going on also yes i did run it through gdb and stepped through all the functions but that didnt tell me much
student,in lecture 21 slides the function prototype of operator is bool operator iterator rhs const shouldnt it be bool operator const iterator rhs const shouldnt you passbyreference since you dont want to make extra copy of iterator and make it const since youre not modifying the iterator
student,i saw the previous thread but it simply doesnt make sense to me i want to add something to the front so i create a new node and attach it to the list and give it whatever datum is stored i want to keep the list still double linked so in my mind i would set the first prev to the new node to keep it double linked however every time i try this i get errors any ideas
student,could you give me a example in detail
student,i only implement a private member variable constructor and an overloaded operator calccpp762 error a storage class can only be specified for objects and functions
student,i am unsure how list test will be graded could i get clarification i understand i want to spread my tests out over several tests because if they incorrectly say clean code has bugs it gets thrown out so is this how it goes 1 you run all our tests with clean code and throw out any code that incorrectly says there is an error 2 with the remaining tests that worked you now test a bunch of buggy code if one of code returns an error we get 11 for that test if it doesnt say error we get 01 3 you run say 50 tests and we add up all we have for a grade so like if we expose 45 correctly we get 4550 or is this wrong like do you also score for clean code so if they all return 0 for a clean code we get 11 for it but wouldnt in that case put us at a disadvantage of more test cases because there are more chances something goes wrong
student,in stack does this mean we cannot add member functions such as the overload of the operator within the class
student,on the lecture 18 cpp file i see this cout fixme pushfront do something with backptrn what should i do with this
student,for some functions weve been taught to check the requires clause by assertingptr to check for null for others we dont have to check do we need to test the requires clause for the erase function if so how is it possible to check if an iterator is dereferenceable other than asserting its value to not be 0 which is null if this is the proper way to check how should we handle the case where the value pointed to by the pointer stored in the iterator is zero
student,when i try to submit to the autograder it gets stuck in a load bar like this i havent been able to find a solution for this searching on piazza and ive made sure my file names follow the correct format any ideas
student,when i pushfront and pushback the size of the list is not correct when more than 3 elements are added it is confusing and i believe that it is something to do with the heap and the way it allocates memory it appears that the nodes are not placed next to each other always it seems especially confused when i combine using pushback and pushfront note i am subtracting the last and first pointers to get size
student,i know this has been answered before but for a sanity check a rational 00 should be printed as 00 and not as undefined right likewise x0 is output as 10 and not as infinity please correct me if i am wrong
student,i am a little confused about how to delete the pointer in erase i have node victim thisptr delete victim victim 0 where thisptr points to the memory address that is to be erased however afterwards it still points to the node that was erased what is my issue
student,so we only need to make our postfix calculator for integers rationals correct
student,just asking because they are private members of the class so im not sure whether testing would be required
student,is front supposed to return the first node in the list or the datum at the first node in the list
student,when i run my code with rationalpublictest on caen it compiles and passes all of the test yet when i run it on the auto grader it fails
student,whats different between function pointer and functor
student,hi when i run my stack public test it finishes testcountitem and then gives me a long error message that starts like this error in stackpublictest double free or corruption out 0x00000000015b9020 backtrace lib64libcso60x7d1fd0x7fba136aa1fd what does this mean
student,are we allowed to use helper classes for instance something similar to what we learned about functors
student,when i try to assign my newlyconstructed node pointers address to firsts next position accessed with the arrow operator im getting a excbadaccess error in xcode i know that error can often mean that one is incorrectly trying to access a null pointer but in this case i want to be accessing the null pointer to assign this new nodes address to it my first question then is whats the real deal with accessing null pointers cant you get at them to assign something else to them second do you think this is a problem with my assignment operator third help
student,this may be a dumb question but when the autograder tests our calccpp using calcin tests does it use our stackh file or its own correct version of a stackh
student,in calccpp should 0 or 00 be displayed for a command 0 0
student,so my output has been printing all the correct information and after the last correct line is printed the following error is printed in the terminal calc listh83 void listtpopfront with t rational assertion empty failed aborted i tried to use gdb to find out why pop front was being called after the function was done and couldnt find where it was called at the end any solution to this
student,with the final exam nearing i was just wondering roughly what the historical breakdown for grades as been in this class as in what are the general percentile ranges for each letter grade
student,ive tested list and stack extensively and everything works great but when i try to implement calc the first rational number isnt being put into the stack im not sure what the problem iswhat it could be if anyone has any pointers
student,on the autograder we fail the compilation test for stackpublictest however when we run stackpublictest and make test on caen it compiles and passes the test we have checked to see if we included the correct libraries and on caen our calc outputs are also correct we are not getting any error messages and do not know why we are failing the compilation test any ideas as to what could be wrong
student,i am working on the countif function and i am trying to navigate through the linked list using an iterator but i am not sure how i should declare the iterator this is what i have inside of my countif function listtiterator iter listbegin but the compiler gives me an error saying i cannot do this how am i supposed to declare an iterator for my list within stackh
student,my code works for calctest00in and calctest01in but on the autograder it says that my return code is incorrect and that my listtest functions dont compile but when i run make test on my terminal it works with no problem any ideas
student,i havent used these two functions at all for stackh or calccpp im worried that i might be missing something
student,any idea what this error means were not leaking memory so were not sure how to solve this
student,for which functions do i write tests for only the list functions or all the iterator operations too
student,i am just struggling with how to think about how stack works how do i base it on lists is it simply a list with some other functions that modify it in a new way for empty do i just use the list empty i am just having a hard time visualizing it i have read the spec over and over
student,what are the likely problems for list failing to compile on the autograder but it compiling on caen and valgrind clean
student,im confused as to how to go about this part i am reading in the input as a string but if the number is something like 233 atoi simply makes it 23 which is valid but the original input was not so this is supposed to gracefully crash with assert right
student,thanks
student,when i use calc to test my calculator nothing really happens but when i run calc using calc the calculator works what exactly does calc do
student,hey when i use run make the listcompilecheck passes i made sure to download the latest one and directly test it when i sumbit to autograder however i get that the return code is incorrect would it be safe to say that the autograder compilecheck is different than the one that we were given and that there is a bug in listh that hasnt been caught there was a previous post asking this but the students answer was confusing and did not tailor to these exact circumstances
student,if we make a functor class for using the m operator do we have to declare the class as static or not
student,for some crazy reason our program refuses to read in plus signs and minus signs as characters in our calccpp it will read in every other character just fine but plus signs and minus signs arent read in literally changing all the plus signs in our code to commas fixes the problem this happens on both xcode and linux any ideas on how this could happen
student,is it 12 12 3 12 3 4 or something else
student,could anyone help me clarify this concept i didnt get that
student,as far as i have read the speck for stackh it says nothing about making an iterator for this class since we cannot access the iterator in list can i or should i make an iterator so i dont have to clone lists to iterate through them
student,when we are running the calculator in terminal can you input a negative number ie can you write 10 or do you have to do 10 n if i do 10 3 i fail my assert statement because it is not recognizing 10 to be a number is this an issue thanks
student,i am having a hard time understanding the description for m in the example we start with an empty stack and command 2 2 3 2 4 2 m and end up with 3 4 2 3 2 2 so i understand that we first pop off 2 then 3 2s remain where does the 4 come from thoughjquery171088710514456033711449691797279 could someone just run though the entire logic of how the new stack was created much appreciated
student,i am currently trying to use an iterator within my operator for stackh but i keep getting an error that i cannot access the constructor for an iterator i have declared the function as a friend of stack and list as a friend of iterator am i missing a friend call or am i using iterator incorrectly
student,what is the difference between the copy constructor and void copyall
student,the blue slides on the lecture recording are completely unreadable is there any way i can see them i really rely on the lecture recordings so this is a problem for me
student,so in my insert function in listh i create a new node np to hold the new value that i am inserting into the list if i end the function with delete np np 0 then i get no errors but without it i get a valgrind error this does not need to be done for my popback and popfront functions though and they seem to essentially be doing the same thing is the destructor not taking care of the new memory in this case
student,my operator for stackh is compiling but any time there is code in my test cases that uses the compiler responds with undefined symbols for architecture x8664 operatorstd1basicostreamchar std1chartraitschar stackint const referenced from main in stackpublictest4b0fb2o ld symbols not found for architecture x8664 any ideas of how to solve this issue
student,if the denominator is zero what do we do do we assert this and crash the program or do we change the sign of the numerator
student,when the input is a negative zero to rational does it automatically change to a zero or do we need to check for the input 0 and change it to a zero
student,does c store 0 as 0 or are they two distinct values
student,i am trying to figure out how to trigger calc to quit i realize that the q command will do that but from my understanding it should also quit when it gets to the end of a file i thought about using the eof indicator but since we are not technically reading in from a file but rather piping a file to std input i do not think eof would work additonally since the spec says the inputs will be seperated by whitespace and does not say what whitespace i am assuming that any whitespace including one or more blank lines is fair game i am at a lost as to where to go from here if someone could point me in the right direction or could point to an error in my logic that would be appreciated
student,can anyone give me a hint on what to do regarding match i know you are supposed to use the countif function but the pred function that uses only takes in one argument and to compare two arguments the top number and other numbers in the stack dont you need to have a function that takes in to arguments
student,all of my listh functions are implemented and im passing all the asserts in the compilecheck and im valgrind clean but im using some cout statements and at the end of listcompilecheckcpp it looks like its calling the destructor multiple times im not getting any errors im just confused why this might be happening is that normal i would have expected only one to run
student,i am getting the error stoi was not declared in this scope when i try to compile in caen does anyone know how i might fix this
student,should we be using template typename t in calccpp for example for defining the functor with a template i know that we are working with rationals so ive been using stackrational rather than stackt
student,do we need a default constructor and an overloaded constructor with 1 stack parameter for stack in the publictest it seems that a new stack is being created by passing in another stack
student,how can i recognize numbers chars symbols from the input also how can i recognize the input is finished
student,im testing the front and back functions and front seems to be working back is working for every case so far except one where the last function i used on my list was popback i printed what back returned and it was whats supposed to be the 2nd to last element so i assumed that my popback function was for some reason deleting 2 elements but i did other tests for the size of the list after using popback and it was correct i checked the size of the list in my problem test case and it was 2 but the list had 4 elements before i used popback im pretty sure its not a problem with my popback function because it worked fine for other tests i also made sure that i didnt accidentally call popback twice i moved popback to before some pushfront calls and it worked fine i also kept that popback where it was and added another popback with some pushfront calls in between and that worked fine so it seems that i only have this problem when i use popback at the very end either once or multiple consecutive times help
student,after i use erase with an iterator when i try to cout that iterator again it still couts what it was pointing to originally even though when i print out the list it prints it out with the item erased is this fine i know when we change the list structure it invalidates the iterator i just want to make sure that couting the item it was previously pointing at is a possible case after it has been invalidated also how are we supposed to check that an iterator is a valid iterator for a list when asserting the requires clause for erase and insert because in the case of my problem my iterator is still dereferencable because i can cout it
student,when trying to write countif i am getting an error saying the outofline declaration for countif does not match any function in stackt i am including the stackpredicate before the function name what is the issue
student,for some reason my code for finding a common factor is not saving the common factor value i used an if statement nested in a for loop once the loop ends are the values erased even though i use the common factor variable right after the loop
student,when an operator is called that is not print or print all etc is the resulting stack outputted to the standard output stream or is the result simply stored on the stack
student,for my erase function i pass an iterator lets say i by value in the function i create a temporary node ptr temp that has the same value as the nodeptr for i ive checked through the debugger to verify that all three of of these addresses are the same i the pass by value copy of i and temp at the end of the function i call delete temp temp 0 when i go back to the function that called erase i still has the same nodeptr as before because it was pass by value i explicitly called delete temp when the nodeptr for i and temp both had the same value but when i call i it still points to a valid node and returns the datum value from the node i thought i deleted any idea why this is happening
student,for some reason when i run rationalpublictest the s r lines are totally ignored and there is no output i assumed this meant there was something wrong with my operator overload function in rationalcpp any thoughts thanks
student,how do we run calccpp with one of the given input files i thought it was calc calctest00in but it just waits for my input
student,in the spec for the negate operator it doesnt say anything about requiring the stack having at least one operand so would asserting stacksize 0 be technically wrong or should we assume itd be safe to assert
student,do we have to be able to do this typename listintiterator i some iterator here
student,i originally had the top of the stack as the end of the list but printing the list is backwards and since im using an iterator i thought it would be easier to change the top of my stack to the front when i change everything so that the top is the first item i now all of a sudden get a segmentation fault and errors of conditional jump or move depends on uninitialised values for the countif function which didnt have any errors when top of the stack was the back of the list i cant find anything im missing in changing over from back to front any ideas what its doing or is there a way to use the iterator to go backwards through the list instead
student,in the spec it says 2 infinity is infinity 10 does that mean 2 negative infinity is negative infinity 10 all rules still apply
student,i know this is supposed to happen at the end of the constructor but can we add a helper function to apply euclids theorem and simplify the rational number
student,when i try to do pprev new node it gives me an error saying that both sides of the equal sign have no affect what does that message mean since both sides of the equal sign clearly mean something
student,after deleting an element where does nodeptr point to same question for insert
student,why are we submitting many different files to test list would the compiler get mad if we just tried to test different types of lists in the same file ive been wondering this ever since i started
student,what does this mean and how to i change the rational to a rational for comparison
student,any tips of hints weve been trying for about an hour with no luck
student,ive looked at the spec but it isnt very clear about this and the situation doesnt come up in any of the examples if the following line were to be entered to the rpn calculator would it execute each item in the command before coming to the quit command or immediately detect that there is a quit in the line and exit 1 2 3 a q
student,hello all i am not sure how to check for a valid iterator for the insert function i understand that a valid iterator has a nodepointer that points to somewhere in the list or one after but how do you check for that or do you not need to and assume that a valid iterator will always be passed in thanks in advance
student,is insert supposed to be able to put a datum at the end of the list if so what would the pointer be that the iterator would point to 0
student,should cout statements work in our destructors
student,the rem for insert says that you are supposed to insert the datum t before the iterator pointer should we include the case if the iterator 0 this being the end of the list
student,when testing my calculator i noticed that if i enter a very large number such as 9000000000 the stack stores it as a different number in this case 858993460 it works for everything else though i was wondering if this could be due to the maximum size that the int type can hold and if this is true should i assume that our calculators will not be tested on numbers this large
student,im getting a really confusing error when i run make test i saw a couple of other people had similar errors but i couldnt figure out how to fix it im compiling in caen as well so i dont think thats the error bash42 make test g wall werror pedantic o1 listtestwassupcpp o listtestwassupexe runmytestspy traceback most recent call last file runmytestspy line 19 in module returncode subprocesscall test file usrlib64python27subprocesspy line 524 in call return popenpopenargs kwargswait file usrlib64python27subprocesspy line 711 in init errread errwrite file usrlib64python27subprocesspy line 1308 in executechild raise childexception oserror errno 8 exec format error make listtests error 1 any thoughts would be great thanks
student,in calccpp were reading in the user input to a string but we dont know how to check if this string represents an int value does anyone have any suggestions on how to do this
student,do classes have a default assignment operator i imagine it would work something like this the lhs is now the rhs more specifically i want to set an existing object to a fresh instance of the same class how should i do that
student,is the listcompilecheck given to us the same one that autograder uses i know we also have to submit test files and such just wondering thanks
student,i know how to use valgrind from lab11 but im not sure how to run valgrind with the makefile command make listtests specifically with leakcheckyes and such can someone help me with some terminal syntax please
student,hi in calccpp im really confused as to how to use string stream as user input and how to convert that into an array of characters since the specs say we cant use cstring library
student,i am a bit confused in one instance i am getting a compiler error for trying this rhs but when i do this rhs it works can someone explain to me why
student,im confused as to what were supposed return for one past the end is it a pointer with the address of a node one past the last node in the list
student,what is happening i think my command is probably wrong what should it be
student,im getting this error when i try to write the code for countif any suggestions on how to fix this
student,when i declare rational r am i able to do r another rational number for instance rational r rational q200 r q gives me an error
student,should dereferencing a iterator return a pointer to a node or the datum of the node in it
student,i cant figure out what valgrind is trying to tell me or what kind of error im making for instance why are there two heap summaries one which says there arent any problems and one that says there are 12613 memcheck a memory error detector 12613 copyright c 20022013 and gnu gpld by julian seward et al 12613 using valgrind3100 and libvex rerun with h for copyright info 12613 command listtest1exe 12613 listtest1exe listtest1cpp38 void testempty assertion lempty failed 12613 12613 heap summary 12613 in use at exit 24 bytes in 1 blocks 12613 total heap usage 4 allocs 3 frees 235 bytes allocated 12613 12613 24 bytes in 1 blocks are definitely lost in loss record 1 of 1 12613 at 0x4c2a105 operator newunsigned long in usrlib64valgrindvgpreloadmemcheckamd64linuxso 12613 by 0x400813 testempty in homeeecs280p5listtest1exe 12613 by 0x400873 main in homeeecs280p5listtest1exe 12613 12613 leak summary 12613 definitely lost 24 bytes in 1 blocks 12613 indirectly lost 0 bytes in 0 blocks 12613 possibly lost 0 bytes in 0 blocks 12613 still reachable 0 bytes in 0 blocks 12613 suppressed 0 bytes in 0 blocks 12613 12613 for counts of detected and suppressed errors rerun with v 12613 error summary 1 errors from 1 contexts suppressed 2 from 2 valgrind error in test listtest1exe 12615 memcheck a memory error detector 12615 copyright c 20022013 and gnu gpld by julian seward et al 12615 using valgrind3100 and libvex rerun with h for copyright info 12615 command listteststarterexe 12615 12615 12615 heap summary 12615 in use at exit 0 bytes in 0 blocks 12615 total heap usage 0 allocs 0 frees 0 bytes allocated 12615 12615 all heap blocks were freed no leaks are possible 12615 12615 for counts of detected and suppressed errors rerun with v 12615 error summary 0 errors from 0 contexts suppressed 2 from 2 out of 2 tests run 1 tests passed 1 tests failed 1 valgrind errors

student,will you guys post more practice problems before the exam right now there are only problems for lectures 1116 they were really helpful
student,do we need to use trycatch blocks in calccpp for reading in text for the calculator basically are we required to do any errorchecking for human input
student,will we be graded on style for our listtest files
student,to use predicate pred in countif do we need to create another class to check if an element exists and define the function operator to return a bool value
student,hey guys lets say we have 05 or any number of numerator0 and denominator0 should this be saved internally as 05 or 01 and would it be printed as just 0
student,
student,from the course notes when and why would you use the second method whenever you make a list you make nodes on the heap so what is the difference when you make the list itself on the stack vs the heap
student,so in professor deorios lecture 10 slides on slide 27 it says pitfall the order in which elements are initialized is the order they appear in the object not the order in the initialization list what does this mean can someone give me an example thanks so much
student,my caen linux account has always been buggy but now its gotten so it prevents me from being able to get work done when i delete text the text i deleted will often flash back onto the screen for several minutes making it impossible to keep typing until it stops this happens in gedit in the terminal and on web pages i thought it was an issue with the computer i was using but the weirdness follows me across multiple computers last year i had similar issues in engin 101 heres a video of the behaviour that i put on youtube because i couldnt get it to play otherwise i wasnt typing or using the mouse while i filmed the video
student,i wrote my destructor function but it doesnt want to work for any input t value it spits out the following error listtestdestructorcpp332 error cannot delete expression of type listint delete intlist im confused as to why my list destructor isnt working and why this is related to the type of the list i believe it must have something to do with the templating but im not sure
student,i am trying to use my popfront function from listh in stackh but i keep getting an error when trying to compile the stack public test that says error no matching function call to listintpopfront const as far as i can tell i am calling popfront correctly where am i going wrong thanks
student,in our calccpp file should we check for invalid input
student,so i have read through the spec and piazza and understand what the q command is supposed to do and when i have it implemented and type it into std input it is not causing the program to stop running is there more that needs to be done other than simply returning 0
student,when i submit my files it gives me full points for the submission however it says return code incorrect so it gives me the points for a correct submission but says incorrect should i worry about this
student,in listterase should we increment the iterator i after erasing the node at that position or should we assume whatever is calling erase will be incrementing the iterator
student,i saw this in the lecture slides why would you be able to do iterator i listbegin for example struct integer int number int main integer i3 or integer inumber 3 wouldnt that be the correct syntax why are you able to assign an iterator to one of its members
student,should a list be able to hold other lists or just ints double char etc
student,i know the specs say we are supposed to use user input but does that input have to be done from the terminal using argc and argv or in the form of cin during runtime
student,im trying to use an iterator in my countif function but wherever i place the template typename t declaration for using listtiterator it says that it isnt detecting it or i get a long error message am i using iterators wrong or am i not supposed to define the template as t
student,im still confused on the difference between data and procedural abstraction if someone could give me a brief explanation and a difference between them that would be awesome thanks
student,return the address of the data in the pointedto node the compiler then reapplies the operator with the returned pointer t operator const assertnodeptr return nodeptrdatum why does the compiler do this
student,im confused why we need to write a destructor for iterator since it doesnt manage dynamic memory it just accesses it
student,i am getting this error when i try to make a rational variable in calccpp does anyone know how to fix this error thanks
student,will there be a vidal review session for the final exam and if so when
student,when i submit my files to the autograder the autograder is terminating because my program is exceeding the time limit i obviously have an infinite loop in calccpp i am wondering how to avoid an infinite loop since i am reading in calctest 00 or calctes t01 in main until i read in q so my while statement is whilecommand q take in arguments and apply them to stack obviously q is not ever going to be read in because it isnt on the calctest 00 or calctest01 i dont understand what else could go into the while loop because the idea is to stop running the program once someone quits the calculator right
student,why dont the provided input files eg calctest00in end with a q command how will our programs determine if we have reached the end of the user input if theres no q command
student,can we incorporate other libraries in our listtests one of my tests uses char so id like to use cstring it gets boring just testing with ints or doubles
student,in iterator insert function i am calling new node because we are creating a new node that we want to insert when i step into the function a new node p already has a datum value inside it i think since it is a new node it should not have any value in it but i dont know what is happening here can anyone help me with this thanks
student,for the overloaded assignment operator are we creating 3 new nodes in order to do a deep copy of the nodes pointed to by first last and the current node
student,hello in order to check my argvs i would need to use the strcmp function in the cstring library however the cstring library is not one of the allowed libraries for this project in this case should i make my own cstring comparison helper function or allow the cstring library for this one specific function it does say in the dos and do nots to use cstrings to check argv
student,if the number inputed is 100000 for example is there a way for atoi to convert this to an int or is there another method you have to use
student,the spec says to run the calc program interactively use calc however when i do this it says no such job but it does run when i execute calc what does mean in this context and is it a problem that my program doesnt execute with this command
student,do these do the same thing int p new int p 5 and p new int10 thanks
student,i am getting the error from the auto grader saying your program exceeded the time limit and was terminated under calctest 00 and calctest 01 what am i doing wrong my calculator works perfectly in xcode thanks
student,so i passed the the autograder for the files given but i would like to test using some of my own values i am a bit confused on how to do this without creating a text file of a bunch of values and operators any help is much appreciated
student,is there a systematic way to figure out if we need a shallow copy or a deep copy im confused as to whether or not stack needs a copy constructorassignment operator overload if we do a shallow copy of stack will it do a shallow copy of list or will it recognize that list has a copy constructorassignment op overload and use the deep version thanks
student,stack has a listt list variable in its private section because it is written like that is it already initialized without writing any extra code what i mean is with this stack will the list variable automatically be initialized or do we need to say something like this stack list list furthermore for the destructor when stack goes out of scope it will be destroyed as normal or if we type delete when an instance of stack is destroyed will lists destructor automatically be called since a list must also be automatically destroyed when a stack is destroyed
student,my listh passes the compile check and when i only popback once it passes some simple test cases but when i call popback more than once it seg faults gbb says my error is in my prefix increment operator but i dont know how this is possible if it works once shouldnt it work again im calling it on a list of 5 objects so the error isnt when i reach the end only when i call it more than once
student,i am trying to write popfront currently after writing out everything in the code i thought should work and repeatedly getting segmentation fault i tried to just create node p give it the datum and then do first p and when i compile it with an empty list it still gives me a segmentation fault any advice
student,im confused about how to implement stack do i just treat it as another list and use the iterator class nodeptr etc and use list functions inside the stack functions
student,are we allowed to add public get functions to listh for testing practices
student,are we supposed to use functors on project 5 the spec leads me to believe so but we havent had a lab on them yet so im not sure
student,for certain tests im going to want to iterate through each node of a list but theres no way for me to access the first or last pointers and hence their next or prev pointers im assuming we have to somehow use iterators to do this but im unsure as to how can someone help explain this to me
student,so first let me say that yes i searched on piazza and yes i found a post relating to this exact thing i am still unsure as to how this works and want to make sure that i am doing this right before i break something the post i saw was 2942 i just want to double check that running this command chmod x runmytestsp will not break anything
student,are we allow to create a helper function within iterator class to help retrieve the nodeptr
student,in the spec it says n negate negate the top item on the stack however it doesnt specify if it requires a stack of at least one operand like other operations described in the section it makes sense that there should be at least one operand but it doesnt specify should we assume this or should we just make calc do nothing when the stack is empty and n is an input
student,hello where should nodeptr point after the erase deletes the current node the one before after or does it not matter thanks in advance
student,to clarify when there is 1 node in the list first points to the node and last points to 0 correct
student,in our list assignment operator should we be calling copyall before we assign the first and last pointers do we even need to call copyall
student,can someone explain why this error occurs template typename u is included in my code right before the function
student,when i am trying to print a stack i use an iterator to go through the list within the stack and i am failing the assert of a null pointer i used gdb and when i get to the dereference operator for iterator it says this synthetic pointer what does this mean
student,i read the spec but am confused about what exactly the q quit command does what does it mean by exit calculator with a 0 exit value and how would we account for the typing controld must also cause the calculator to exit with status 0 i wouldve thought just exit0 but it says not to because of memory leaks thanks
student,how do we know when to start stop reading user input we dont give a prompt to start so do we just sit at cin until the user realizes to enter something and if thats the case im still unsure of when to stop thanks
student,i know that calling exit0 causes memory leaks because the destructor never runs and nodes are left uncleaned up but why does that is that a problem since the program just ended all its memory gets freed up anyway right
student,if an iterator points to a null is it deferenceable
student,so ive tried searching on piazza for some insight but im still pretty confused as to how were supposed to implement calccpp from the spec i can see that we should write different helper functions based on which command is inputted however i dont understand how the input works from the spec i see that it will be well formatted with a space after each operation but that leaves me with the following questions 1 are the commands being read in from a file or from some form of user input 2 if user input are we supposed to read in an entire string of commands and dissect it for what were supposed to do 3 after we perform each line of operations do we scrap the stack and start with a new one or are we supposed to build off of the previous one i know we can have lines with multiple operations like 4 5 2 but i mean different lines of operation like 4 5 2 and 6 7 2 thanks
student,in lab 11 i wrote animal a i then used the pointer a to use variables like getname looking back over this it doesnt make sense to me in listh the operator overload function returns a reference to t but a is a pointer so these types dont match up how did this work
student,the project spec tells us to be very specific in each of our cpp files does this mean that each file should only contain one test of a function for example would it be alright to test pushfront and pushback on an empty list within the same cpp file or would i need to create a new cpp file for each individual test thanks
student,we are testing list constructors copy and assignment and when we run the valgrind test it says 17967 memcheck a memory error detector 17967 copyright c 20022013 and gnu gpld by julian seward et al 17967 using valgrind3100 and libvex rerun with h for copyright info 17967 command listtestconstructorexe 17967 17967 conditional jump or move depends on uninitialised values 17967 at 0x400dec listintlistlistint const in homejunhouseeecs280proj5listtestconstructorexe 17967 by 0x400be8 testconstructor in homejunhouseeecs280proj5listtestconstructorexe 17967 by 0x400c94 main in homejunhouseeecs280proj5listtestconstructorexe 17967 17967 heap summary 17967 in use at exit 0 bytes in 0 blocks 17967 total heap usage 10 allocs 10 frees 240 bytes allocated 17967 17967 all heap blocks were freed no leaks are possible 17967 17967 for counts of detected and suppressed errors rerun with v 17967 use trackoriginsyes to see where uninitialised values come from 17967 error summary 1 errors from 1 contexts suppressed 2 from 2 it says no leaks are possible but it is giving me this error what could be the possible cause of this thanks
student,despite declaring list as a friend class in stack it returns an error that says list is private i assumed by the hint that the friend declaration would stop this
student,i was wondering if after this semester i would access to our own code on the autograder so i dont have to save it on my computer separately also will the lectures on the google drive be available to us after this semester thanks
student,for practice problem number 3 for lectures 1114 the 7th line of output is supposed to be my name is bob is this because speak is not virtual therefore the speak from person class is used also if it was virtual would the speak from the builder class be used
student,are we allowed to use the fstream library in calccpp
student,in all the lecture example h files and in lab 11 the operator is defined for iterator however for project 5 both the header file and the project specs dont specify that we need to implement this operator is there a reason for this or is it implemented somewhere else
student,im sorry if this is a dumb question but can we use iterators in the implementation of the size function for a list the reason im asking is that the size member is defined before the iterator class
student,sorry this may be a stupid question but is this the only type of input from the autograder we are going to get back on our listtest files or is there something wrong with my files student test suite list tests student test case listtestemptycpp compilation success student test case listtestsizecpp compilation success student test case listtestpushfrontcpp compilation success student test case listtestpushbackcpp compilation success student test case listtestpopfrontcpp compilation success student test case listtestpopbackcpp compilation success student test case listtestlistconstructorscpp compilation success student test case listtestiteratorplusminuscpp compilation success student test case listtestiteratordereferencecpp compilation success student test case listtestiteratorequalandnotcpp compilation success student test case listtestiteratorconstructorscpp compilation success student test case listtestbegincpp compilation success student test case listtestendcpp compilation success student test case listtesterasecpp compilation success student test case listtestinsertcpp compilation success

student,im a bit confused about whether calc should be able to take in a file user input or both can someone clarify
student,do we have to check for dangling iterators when deleting elements and if the answer is yes how so if the iterator is currently pointed to the front node and i pop the front node then there will be an iterator pointing to a nonexistent node i was thinking i would just delete this iterator when that happens but i cant think of any way in which i can check which iterators are pointed at that node
student,im trying to write test cases for my listh but for some reason i cant make listteststartercpp its been giving me the no rule to make target listteststarter stop error listcompilecheck compiles and runs just fine so i have been using that to test but it has been getting rather messy and i would like to have another test case file i have been spelling everything correctly in the terminal and all of the files are in the same directory im sure im just missing something extremely trivial could anyone please help me out thanks
student,i am on a caen computer i have done all of my coding for this project on a caen computer i found my listh compiles by running make listcompilecheck now when i want to try to start testing i start by attempting to compile my tests through make listtests as is described in the specs i get an error saying no rule to make target listtests stop what is going on
student,of course im familiar with structorclassptrmembervariable but what do we do if membervariable is a pointer and we want to dereference it i looked through the slides looked through piazza and did a bit of googling but i cant seem to find the answer i would guess the correct syntax would be structorclassptrmembervariable but im not sure can someone check me on this
student,i am very lost on the syntax for how to use dynamic cast to check if your type is a chicken or horse literally one line of code but i am clueless as to how to use it i need help
student,the code in the title throws an error for me listend returns an iterator with nullptr null iteratoroperator asserts nodeptr this code is from the starter so is calling on an end iterator supposed to throw an error it seems like you should be able to call on end

student,for some reason my loop with an iterator in my counting function is looping over 3000 times its the same iterator loop i used in task 1 and in task one it only loops 11 times which is correct
student,so im having trouble creating the overloaded operator because im unable to properly declare it as a friend function of stack i have the template typename u declaration and then friend entire line of the operator signature however if gives me the following error ostream in namespace std does not name a type im not sure what that means or how i would go about fixing it considering i dont think it has to do with the template type thanks
student,every time i type either an operator or c into my calculator a 0 gets pushed on to the stack i am very lost as to why this could be happening anyone else have this problem
student,i am trying to delete the node ptr i use to point to the first element in the list but am getting an error pointer being freed was not allocated i set the ptr first which points to a new node any ideas on why i might be getting this error
student,for task 1 the noise each animal makes prints out fine but the names dont print i used the same method for both getname and talk in my for loop so why doesnt getname work
student,in lab11how can do i tell which one is chicken and which one is horse whithout going back to read from a file
student,what functions if any do we not need to test for for each of the public functions in listh does this mean we have to make tests for the big 3 somehow does this mean that we have to make tests for begin or end does this mean we have to make tests for the different iterator operators
student,what is the difference between typename u used in stackh for the overloaded operator and typename t used elsewhere if there is a difference how should we know which one to use in calccpp
student,when making a functor to pass in as predicate does it take in a parameter of type t and does this functor somehow have access to the list in stack
student,my rational class was working last week and passed all my tests and all the public tests so i left it alone and worked on other parts of the project now when i try to run any code that uses rational i get an undefined reference to error for everything defined in rational does anyone know what i might have changed to cause this all my rational files are in the same directory as before and i havent changed them
student,when i do a make listtests it seems that runmytestspy gets caught in a loop and never actually finishes running i have no idea why can anyone help the assertions that failed printed out but the summary statement does not
student,see above
student,can someone explain the difference between upcast and downcast im reviewing the lecture slides and from the examples they seem to be doing the same thing thanks
student,so a doubly linked list 1 2 3 is equivalent to a stack of 1 2 3 right if thats the difference that what would be the point of the stack class
student,do we have an estimate on when the autograder will be available my partner and i are almost ready to submit and were wondering when its going up
student,error in stackpublictest double free or corruption fasttop 0x00000000008360b0 im getting this error when i run stack public test however i put cout statements throughout the entire test and it makes it all the way to the end im assuming this is due to the fact that i have a memory leak somewhere i believe my leak is coming from iterator because my destructor for iterator doesnt have any implementation does anyone have any suggestions on what my iterator destructor should take care of deleting or if it has to delete any memory at all thanks
student,lab11cpp10617 error request for member ‘getname’ in ‘ ilistiteratoroperatoranimal’ which is of pointer type ‘animal’ maybe you meant to use ‘’ cout igetnametalk endl this happens when i wrote lab11 but i dont know and understand why this happens
student,i looked back at the lecture slides and there are a number of things im confused on i guess my first question would be assuming we know how to implement erase what would ever be the advantage to using it yes if i want to get rid of an iterator but why would i ever want or need to do that and correct me if im wrong but if we try to delete a container of pointers then well delete the container but not the pointers themselves so if we ever want to delete a container of pointers then we first have to get rid of the pointers individually so say that i have an iterator that is pointing to node2 and i also have node1 which has a next pointer pointing to node2 i know that bad things happen if we say delete node2 and adjust the next pointer for node1 but we dont do anything for the iterator my question then is what happens if we delete an iterator not the pointer inside of it just the iterator
student,im having some trouble passing iterators in my test file i have a valid list of 12345 with a valid iterator pointing to the beginning i am checking with assertiter1 intlist1begin when i step into my insert function after calling intlist1insertiter1 42 my iterator the nodeptr values in insert in listtestcpp gdb print iter1nodeptr 1 next 0x605030 prev 0x0 datum 1 gdb print iter1nodeptrnext 2 next 0x605010 prev 0x605070 datum 2 gdb n in listh breakpoint 2 listintinsert this0x7fffffffe000 i datum0x7fffffffe06c 42 at listh291 291 if i begin gdb print inodeptr 3 next 0x0 prev 0x0 datum 0 whats going on
student,are erase and insert supposed to have their implementations within the class or outside of it this is just unclear to me because the functions involve iterators but are in the public parts of list not iterator but when i try to compile i get an error saying that iterator was not declared in this scope
student,640 pm on 1262015
student,i am confused on how to change the lecture code to adapt to a double linked list do i just have to change the functions that have cout fixme
student,hi so ive been struggling with this for like 2 hours and i finally figured out which line gives me the segment fault but i dont understand why i get the segment fault error when i have this line in my code last lastprev i couted last and lastprev right before this line and last 0x1022030 good not 0 and my lastprev 0 also good only one element in my list but then why am i getting an error when i do last lastprev isnt that just the same as saying last 0 i thought we could do that thanks
student,thanks
student,can someone help me figure out what the error is here
student,i wrote a tail recursive function which implemented euclid algorithm to calculate greatest common divisor i must use o2 instead of o1 to not cause segmentation fault when the function calculates the gcd of 1000000 1 is it ok or i need to write a nonrecursive version
student,if my stack is 1 2 3 4 would 1 or 4 be the top
student,i keep getting segmentation faults in list when i try to update the prev node of the first node for example something like this firstprev 0 i cant figure out any other way to update prev once i copy a new node in place of the first node can anyone explain what im doing wrong
student,for calccpp in order to read in certain values we need a type are we supposed to template the type or expect to read in integers to create rational numbers
student,when testing using stackpublictestcpp why does my code still work without a constructor copyconstructor operator overload do we not use constructors when these are called stackint mystack default constructor stackint stackcpymystack copy constructor mystack stackcpy operator overload
student,how would i print nothing if the stack is empty do i just do os
student,should the prev pointer for the node pointed to by first point to null ie firstprev 0 and related when theres only one item in the list should the prev pointer pointed to by last and first point to 0 ie lastprev 0 and firstprev 0
student,when we implement the overloaded operators on rational numbers the spec lists some cases using infinity and undefined values that should still work one in specific is infinity infinity will result in undefined does this mean that it doesnt matter if its positive infinity or negative infinity
student,my partner and i are having issues on the count if function we tried to make the function as basic as possible to reduce our errors but even with the function reduced to this template typename predicate int stacktcountifpredicate pred const return 1 we still get an error saying that t was not declared in this scope and the non member function cannot have a cvqualifier not exactly sure where to go from here any hints
student,hello i am running my list tests using the given python file and for some reason if i intentionally fail a test the make listtests command still returns the test as passed thanks
student,what is the difference in terms of memory allocation of defining a class in the main function and defining it outside the main function eg class a int main return 0 and int main class a return 0
student,hello fellow piazza users my partner and i have read the other piazza posts but we are still unsure whether we should insert with an empty list we know that insert requires a valid iterator ie somewhere in the list or onepasttheend alexandra brown but is onepasttheend the same thing as empty or no thank you in advance to whoever answers
student,what is 1010 according to the arithmetic it is 0101000 but infinity plus infinity should be infinity in common sense

student,serious question why does listh contain our function definitions doesnt that defeat the point of using a header file our functions arent quick oneoff inline definitions also why do we have two classes in the same file is there a reason that our code is structured this way like it seems like a reeeeeeally strange style choice unless im missing something in which case plz inform me
student,so i understand we have to call the overloaded operator function as a friend function in stack but the private section in stack says that we are not supposed to modify the private section are we allowed to declare the friend function in the public section of stack
student,i am getting the error outofline definition of countif does not match any declaration in the global namespace i have my countif function declared as template typename predicate int stacktcountifpredicate pred const any suggestions i changed int stackt to int stackpredicate and im still getting errors
student,do we need to test popall it is private and the only function that uses it is the destructor so we cant really test it through another function
student,dear instructors first i just wanted to make sure that we can create and use an int variable inside the curly braces of the custom constructor second we can use the denominatorin and numeratorin as variables within the curly braces of the custom constructor thank you for the clarification
student,i understand that by giving friendship in iterator methods inside of list now have access to private members of iterator does nodeptr a private member variable in iterator have access to the public or private members in list could an iterator i touch next prev in the node struct or even first and last pointers which are private
student,are we allowed to make constructors in listh even though were told not to modify the public interface if not how to we adhere to the big three
student,can a constructor access a helper function written in rationalcpp further are helper functions allowed
student,why do pointers have to be declared with a type int mypointer if pointers just contain addresses why would they need this information thanks
student,does valgrind check for dangling pointers if not is there a way we can check for these
student,for member functions like the overloaded parentheses operator would static casting cause you to lose access to the private data members of instances of the object for example if we wanted to create an instance of the functor in main would static casting prevent us from doing this
student,see subject
student,im confused about the operator in stack since list is private we cant access its elements we would use pop but that would just delete elements how would we go about this thanks
student,for stackh im having trouble implementing the operator overload for ive declared the function as a friend with template typename u in stacks member functions im trying to declare an iterator to follow the list is the proper path listuiterator or should it deal with the obj begin passed in
student,i tried implementing this overloaded operator using the list iterator and i am getting the error ambiguous overload for the type declaration i believe it has something to do with the templating but i am not completely sure what is going wrong any suggestions
student,
student,if i call pushfrontdatum for an empty list then the list would only have one node would i have to make both first and last point to that node or can i still leave last as a null pointer
student,is the final exam cumulative i assume that we are expected to know stuff from the first half of the semester and a lot of the stuff we have learned is built off of previous material but will questions be specifically focused on material covered in the first exam
student,how can we check what we are reading in such as if it is an integer or an operator
student,within a unit test like listtestpushfrontonemptycpp will testing things like size empty back etc defeat the purpose of a unit test should we only test what the name of the file specifies and nothing more obviously im not asking if we should test pushback in our pushfront unit test
student,in stackh the top function comment says since a reference is returned potentially the caller can use the call to change the top without doing a poppush you should test for that in your tests does this mean we have to prevent the user from doing illegally changing top or simply write a test case that demonstrates it
student,when i try to compile stackpublictestscpp it says error unknown type name predicate does anyone know how i might fix this thanks
student,do we need to write our own test file for rational or can we just use the public test file also how can we test overflow thanks
student,when we are making a predicate to check through a stack how often a particular integer appears do we just make the pred x if thats the piece of data we are looking to find or x
student,i cant find it can someone tell me where it is
student,can the nodeptr in the iterator passed into insert point to null
student,error message missing template arguments before ‘’ token newcopy lista i have a list called a and i am passing it in as the copy constructor i cant figure out why i continually get the error message above this is the list copy constructor prototype listconst listt obj curious to hear what you have to say thanks
student,just out of cytosine if i have an int variable why cannot i do something like i is this because the prefix increment does not return an int reference
student,should helper functions in calccpp be static i know we are making any helper functions in rational static so they are not visible to the autograder is there an advantage to doing this in real world applications
student,i implemented the prefix operator as shown in class by returning a pointer to this however i am not able to do cool things like iterator however if i do it in two lines like iterator iterator it works as it should i am missing something
student,
student,is there a valgrind command that we can use for dynamically allocated memory to determine in which function we are segfaulting
student,in stack we followed the hint that said to declare the operator overload as a friend function in the class declaration above its giving an error that u is not defined in the scope though
student,in the stackhstarter file that is provide the library cstddef is inlcuded at the top yet is not one of the allowed libraries to include as said in the project spec do we include it
student,but crashes with a bad memory access when i do the entire program is there any reason to why it would be doing this
student,im getting confused about when and when not to delete new nodes that i create
student,just to make sure when we do something like iter listend it will get us to the very end of the list correct the nodeptr will be pointing to null if we wanted to erase something one before would we have to i multiple times until we get to the end since the assertion for i operator fails when nodeptr is null
student,if anyone is still looking for someone for code review please email me at pauljohumichedu asap i can meet on central
student,am i correct in thinking a copy constructor for iterator is not needed
student,im just wondering how are we going to take input from the files do we still need to use the argvmethod or because fstream is not included in the project spec
student,this may be a simple question but when using cout rational1 0 endl should we print the word infinity or 10
student,see header
student,if you did project 4 with a partner do both partners have to have someone to review their code to receive points or do you still receive your style points for doing it if your original partner doesnt do it with someone
student,were making the big three for the stack class to use in our countif function but my project partner and i are not sure how to implement the copy constructor do we even need the big three for stack if we do how would we traverse the stack we dont see how we could traverse the original stack without breaking it down along the way thanks
student,what exactly is insert supposed to do the rme seems a little unclear
student,anyone still need to the do the project 4 code review im at office hours on north now and ill be on central later email me at mrmintzumichedu thanks
student,still looking for a partner can meet anywhere emjabsumichedu
student,should we be able to assign a list of one type to a list of another type ie listint foo listchar bar foo bar
student,can you do the style worksheet with someone who has already done it if you both still attach all files
student,hi i forgot to do this and wanna try to do it before its due im in the fishbowl at one of the caen computers and im wearing a burgundy sweater come by if youre looking for a partner thanks
student,if i worked on a team for project 4 do both me and my partner have to do a code review
student,hi so im getting bad seg faults in my listh when i run the compile check as a result i downloaded gdb and started to try to use it but only ran into more problems when i try to run the executable in gdb i get the following error gdb r starting program usersdocumentseecs280p5listcompilecheck unable to find mach task port for processid 13520 oskern failure 0x5 the internet tells me i need to sign the debugger along with a thousand other inconsistent recommendations it all seems like way too many extra steps that i shouldnt have to be taking is there a simple solution
student,the specs mention that private helper functions are fine what about variables
student,if anyone is looking for a partner please email me amukbilumichedu thanks
student,how do we access the iterators node pointer nodeptr in erase and insert are we allowed to make a function in iterator that lets us use it or no without it i cant seem to think of a way to access the node that the iterator is pointing to
student,im trying to dereference an iterator to a list in project 5 and print the result like this listintiterator myiterator mylistbegin cout myiterator endl but i get this compiler error undefined reference tolistintiteratoriteratorlistintnode my suspicion is that it has something to do with iterator appearing twice in the above statement does anyone know why thats happening thanks
student,if last is a private variable of list and the pubic function end returns an iterator that is past the end is there a way to have an iterator point at the last node without having to start at the first node and move along
student,is it bad to just write our functions above main instead of using function prototypes and writing the functions below main or is it just a matter of personal preference
student,what does it even mean when a denominator is zero is this just equal to infinity i thought that a fraction with zero as its denominator is undefined
student,my plans fell through with my other partner so looking for someone to do it with email me at sanjasazumichedu or just comment
student,can we use the algorithm library for this project
student,bit late but if somebody needs a partner for the code review im available anytime after 1 tomorrow email is jtknoxumichedu
student,my p4 code review partner and i did not hold up our mcards in the photo we followed the directions on the printout sheet which does not specify the mcard necessity do i have to re meet up with my partner
student,so ive been testing my functions in list for project 5 by using other functions of list for example for testing pushfront i would call pushfront then test the result using front is this acceptable or do we have to use list iterators to go through and check certain elements in a list after a function has been called to change the list in some way
student,after deleting the node pointed to by an iterator using the erase function what is the pointertonode in that iterator object supposed to point to null the previousnext node please advise thank you
student,the spec says to add code to delete the animals in the indicated location in lab11cpp ive combed through the file several times and i cant find anything about where my delete code goes unless its in the destructor but that didnt seem to work can someone give me a hint
student,do we need to write specific test cases for the iterator operators and because i am using it in my other test cases for the list functions and it works fine
student,i read in a previous piazza post that it is not copyalls job to erase thiss nodes before replacing it with others does this mean we should use an assert in the beginning of the function and call the operator i just need some insight on how to get started on this function if thats possible thanks
student,will we have to check if the denominator passed in is 0 or does that not make sense to check for
student,are we allowed to use cstrings and atoi to convert the input strings into integers
student,should we be writing a public function to call the private functions to be able to use the functionality outside of our class
student,should the value of the rational number given in the constructor be simplified within the constructor or is it simplified in getnumerator and getdenominator
student,if someone has already completed the review code assignment could they do it again with someone else and just have their code reviewed twice
student,could you confirm the following two statements stack is empty and p command is hit program should exit with assertion failure stack is empty and a command is hit empty line is printed
student,what is the proper way to declare something as a friend function no matter how i try to do it with the output operator it still cannot find the stacks list
student,were trying to use the stoi function within string and we get this error message error ‘ stoi ’ was not declared in this scope we include string in our file so were not sure whats causing the error
student,hey just looking for a partner available all day tomorrow email berkobumichedu
student,we have been going over assignment vs initialization in lectures recently and i just wanted to clarify in the rational constructor that takes in two parameters we should be assigning since we have to check the invariants instead of initializing right thanks
student,is it necessary to write a destructor for stack or will the list destructor do everything that stack would
student,sitting in 1695 at the moment if anyone needs a partner email me at sheebsumichedu
student,anyone who might be still looking for a partner for project 4 code review shoot an email to jyishimwimichedu
student,im looking for a partner to review code on central campus today between 600 and 800 pm email me at pearcereumichedu if youre interested
student,the mic isnt working is there some way she should turn it on
student,im debugging using valgrind and i cannot seem to figure out why i get a signal stop at the line of code in pushback where i set pdatum datum it reads failed to read a valid object file image from memory i believe its coming from my copy constructor any ideas why
student,im looking for a partner for the p4 code review i can meet today or tomorrow on north or central email zalkatibumichedu thanks
student,i am struggling to figure out how to get the animal type from the list for the count functions any pointers
student,can nodeptr points to null for example points to the null before the first element of a list
student,i know that in both of these functions we return this im just confused as to why and is this not the same thing the updated nodeptr is pointing at if not why are we returning that instead of the nodeptr mine have two different addresses and i dont know if thats right thank you
student,i keep getting a segmentation fault at the iter function does this mean that the nodeptr is pointing to some undefined node not in the list since i know were not supposed to modify that function just so lost thanks
student,i was just still kind of confused on what iterators actually do i understand that they have a nodeptr that points to a specific part in the list but they also hold a next andor prev pointer are they part of the list too or are they just nodes if anyone could clarify that would be amazing thanks
student,listh in function u2018typename listtt frontu2019 listh22816 error there are no arguments to u2018emptyu2019 that depend on a template parameter so a declaration of u2018emptyu2019 must be available fpermissive assertempty help
student,for the stack class what does the spec mean by only use the public interface of the list class does that mean we should define stack by creating and using lists
student,for task 1 i constructed my for loop based off the examples shown in lecture i get an error when i use lbegin and it says i dont have an operator for when it was already given to us in listh
student,i am looking for a code review partner for project 4 shoot me an email at colinmiumichedu thanks
student,for iterators function implementations would you do iteratoriteratorinsert code to implement or would you do it with the other list form like template typename t listtiteratorinsert code to implement
student,spotted frthoijustwantoneofjamesjuettsonions onionsorbust
student,calctest00in contains 2 3 4 3 3 4 5 2 m a 2 3 4 3 3 4 5 3 m a 2 3 4 3 3 4 5 5 m a 2 3 4 3 3 4 5 6 m a 1 n 3 n 4 n 1 n 1 n m a notice that there is no q quit command so when make test is run the command calc calctest00in calctest00out never terminate because calc never reads in a q the same applies for calctest01in is this supposed to happen or am i missing something
student,i was thinking to just take the node that is one before the iterator and making the next pointer point to the node that is after the iterator basically bypassing the node is this a fine practice or should i be setting variables to 0 instead of just abandoning them
student,for calc how are we supposed to read in the values is using userinput using cin or is it reading from a file
student,
student,how do i create an iterator since it is a class within a class list a aiterator i thanks
student,the spec says a number has the form one or more digits 0 – 9 does this include numbers with leading zeros like 00123 there are no numbers of this form in the list of valid 2 0 23 41 41 0 or invalid 2 0 03 1013 11 1234 calculator inputs
student,i am in central please email chenkfumichedu if you are interested thanks
student,when is an iterator invalidated i understand it is definitely invalidated if the object it references is deleted but is this the only case could it be considered invalidated if the iterators position in the list changes are there any other ways to invalidate an iterator besides deleting the object it is referencing
student,im getting the error double free or corruption fasttop and then a memory map when i run my list test however i havent implemented anything that deletes objects yet so i dont see how i can be deleting things twice is there another type of error that can cause this message
student,how are we supposed to print out the animals sounds in int main i tried italk and italk but neither of those worked
student,what is our participation grade worth
student,im failing the first assert statement in the testio function of rationalpublictestcpp my function is outputting 12 which is what the assert statement is looking for assertstringr 12 so im not sure why its failing
student,there is no constructor in the class and the specsheet says not to add anything to the list how do you make the node to point to 0 without a constructor
student,what should the prev pointer point to for the first node of the list
student,for printing out the names of the animals im having a hard time figuring out how to format the for loop animal i first is not working because it says first is not declared in the scope and if i declare i as a node it says that node is not declared in the scope either how do i include the the animal class when the iterator is supposed to be a node
student,how exactly would we be able to test the third invariant invariant3 when the rational number is equivalent to an integer including 0 denominator must be 1 thanks
student,after running insert with an iterator should the iterator point and the newly inserted data or stay pointing where it was prior to the function
student,for the constructor with 2 parameters if 0 is passed as the denominator the result will either be infinity undefined or negative infinity but how would we do this with the numerator and denominator variables im just unsure how to numerically represent those things if were supposed to just use them as we are does the infinityundefined stuff come in later in the functions thanks
student,is any number minus infinity equal to infinity
student,ive read through the spec for lab11 and it says we need to complete a prelab survey where do we find this thank you
student,do we need to check the requires clause for iterator insert
student,looking for a partner for the project 4 review my email is jiayunsumichedu
student,
student,i am also looking for a partner for the project 4 review my email is kyleellyumichedu
student,looking for someone to review the project 4 code with so let me know if you are interested i live on central can also work on north email me timmylinumichedu
student,do both the first and last nodes have to be zero for an empty list or just one node ie should i check them with an or statement or an and statement
student,i did the following int listsize const listh157 note list declared here class list shouldnt i be allowed to do so since list is a class
student,i am currently looking for someone to review the project 4 code with so let me know if you are interested i live on central
student,is it ok to add a private member variable to list class
student,does euclideans algorithm also apply to negative integers i was looking online and in the eecs 203 textbook and it doesnt explicitly state that the integers must be positive nor does it explain what happens if we have negative numbers
student,should we run tests for the operator for iterators every time i run a test on it the assert statement for nodeptr fails
student,if anyone is interested in reviewing project 4 let me know
student,the spec for lab 11 references a prelab survey once under completion criteriachecklist and nowhere else is there actually a prelab survey for lab 11 if so will we be emailed a link to the survey in the near future
student,two questions related to iterators listint mylist assume mylist is filled with ints here listintiterator i mylistbegin mylisterasei in the above scenario what happens to i should i by default point to the next or previous element or is i no longer a valid iterator listint mylist 123 mylistpushback1 mylistpushback2 mylistpushback3 listintiterator i mylistbegin i mylistinserti 0 in the above code where does 0 get inserted is the resulting list 1203 also is i still a valid iterator if so what does it point to
student,how can an iterator point to an object in a class list for example without being a pointer itself how is an iterator different from a pointer and why
student,do we have to do all the same operations we did in the 2 input rational constructor again in the overloaded function for print for example converting 07 to 01 and 82 to 4 or is the used with rational numbers already reduced in terms of double negatives and 0 in the numerator
student,i was wondering if you need 2 different submissions for the code review of p4 if you worked in a partnership or maybe just one including my partner and i
student,looking for a partner for the code review for project 4
student,in the public cpp file listcompilecheckcpp what does the following line of code do bool b iter iter2 im a bit confused with seeing the assignment operator and relational operator in the same line
student,if we are working in a group of two do we need to have two different worksheets reviewed by two different classmates or we can submit two of the same worksheet reviewed by just another person since my partner and i have the same code thanks
student,im just curious since list supports custom types could we use our list class to create a list of lists
student,im trying to implement a list constructor but i keep getting the error listtlist names the constructor not the type on stackoverflow everyone who gets this error is trying to declare something that isnt a constructor but i am trying to write a constructor so im confused as to why this is wrong anyone have an idea
student,anyone looking for a partner for the project 4 review
student,quick question on if im doing this right in the slides it says to add template typename t above each member function of list and then add listt instead of list when i do that the syntax coloring changes to white from green green is the color that is used in sublime to show if its a function so now im worried im doing something wrong
student,the function should also return the output stream os as its result so that operations can be chained on a single line this is part of the rme of the operator function what does it mean
student,can anyone tell me why i cant find euchre on the autograder i was hoping to reopen the last files i submitted for the project 4 style assignment
student,in the else statement given in the lecture slides void listtpushbackconst t datum node p new node pdatum datum pnext 0 if empty frontptr backptr p else assertbackptr backptrnext p backptr p why is backptr next p and not pnext
student,i noticed there is a fair amount of code in the drive that seems very similar to the listh file that we need to write what is the difference between the given code and the code we need to write i am confused as to why so much code was provided can i just modify the given code to include the previous pointer any guidance would be appreciated at this point should we be able to code all of project 5 based on what weve covered in juetts lecture or is there still relevant material to come
student,does prev point to the null pointer for the first element in a doublylinked list
student,my code lets me create a list of integers like this listint list but when i try to use a function that accesses the member variables like next i get the error next is not a member of listint does anyone have some advice my suspicion is that im messing up the constructor but im not sure
student,if an operator is entered but there are not enough operands what would we do
student,is 130 330 the only alternate time to choose
student,when id like to run the list tests on caen make listtests runmytestspy make execvp runmytestspy permission denied make listtests error 127 whats wrong help
student,for iterator are we supposed to overload the operator it doesnt say to in the comments in the header file but when i try to compile the basic list tests it tells me it cannot find the operator i tried to overload it to fix that but it still says it cant find the operator what am i missing
student,so when checking whether numerator and denominator have a common factor other than 1 we are running into a lot of different cases to check for this seems overly complicated and were wondering if were missing something thanks
student,for invariant 1 where denominator always has to be greater than or equal to 0 does this mean that we cannot input a negative number in the constructor or does it mean that the negative for the denominator gets factored into the numerator for example if we construct a rational number as rational 5 10 does this mean the numerator gets stored as 5 and the denominator as 10 or are we not allowed to create this rational at all
student,if the input for constructor to create a rational number is 1 0 does that become 10 or 10 because the two negatives cancel out
student,why are the effects clauses of getnumerator and getdenominator different why do we only eliminate common factors in getdenominator doesnt checking the invariants imply ensuring there is no common factors thanks
student,
student,i went to the autograder to see if i could go to my last submission to open and show my partner but project 4 is missing when i go the autograder
student,i dont understand why were supposed to test each function in a separate file for this project instead of one file as we have for the previous projects is there a reason
student,is there a way we can get more than five private github repositories i have the free student upgrade and everything but i heard there was a way to get more through the university
student,
student,is that because copying by value is enough for an iterator
student,what is a floating point exception and how do i debug it
student,are we allowed to use recursion in this project
student,the code in the slide is intlist intlistoperator const intlist rhs if this rhs return this popall pushallrhs return this what is this
student,i am getting the following error in listcompilecheckcpp variable of type listintiterator has private destructor im not sure how to deal with this error because i havent made any destructors that i implemented private thanks
student,should we be using an initializer list in our constructor that takes numeratorin and denominatorin in rationalcpp my understanding is that an initializer list initializes the private member variables before the constructor does any more work could we use the initializer list and then just reassign the values after doing the necessary checks
student,given an empty list the iterator is begin of the list nodeptr0 this iterator is valid or not could we insert an element at this position
student,hello i am just a little confused as to when the due date for the code review is since on the assignment tab in ctools it says friday the 4th but on the worksheet it says the 2nd
student,the code in the slide is void intlistpushfrontint datum node p new node pdatum datum pnext frontptr frontptr p p goes out of scope why does is not use a delete
student,does this work if you want to remove the last integer say you call remove7
student,is there a specific place i can find a list of the gsis emails i cant seem to find any thanks
student,i guess we need to test the public functions for iterators is the filename something like listtestiterator
student,why wouldnt you have to delete the newelts pointer isnt it considered a dangling pointer as well
student,when i test the function pushfrontconst t datum i always get a segmentation fault 11 and i found that the line first p caused the error where p is a node pointer which points to a new node why cant i assign a value to the node pointer first i am very confused about it help
student,when writing copy ctor and asmt op for a templated class i am unsure whether i should write listconst list other copy ctor list operatorconst list rhs asmt op or listconst listt other copy ctor listt operatorconst listt rhs asmt op in what occasion do i have to write t
student,is it okay if i do not complete project 4 code review worksheet i already have a 100 for my style
student,then does it still mean we can add member functions to the public interface of the list class ie default ctor overloading assignment operator
student,just because id like to be 100 certain should copyall append other starting at the last node of this
student,do we need to implement this function it is not in the header file right
student,are we allowed to add member functions to rational that arent listed in rationalh or are any new functions supposed to be outside the class are there any stipulations on the functions if we are allowed to add them as members
student,page 10 of the spec says q quit exit the calculator with a 0 exit value this input is always valid endoffile eg typing controld on linux must also cause the calculator to exit with status 0 note do not call exit0 because it will cause memory leaks why does calling exit0 cause memory leaks or is note do not call exit0 because it will cause memory leaks referring to the fact that there is cleanup work to be done before quitting the program ie the intent of this sentence is to communicate dont just call exit0 and then call it a day without first managing garbage disposal and freeing dynamicallyallocated memory as needed
student,i noticed that for each of the other commands to be implemented in the rpn calculator such as c clear a printall there is a sentence this requires at least onetwo operands see project5pdf pages 810 for the specifications for the aforementioned other commands see project5pdf top of page 10 for the specifications for the n negate command there is no such sentence in the specification for the command n negate does the negate command require that there be at least one or some other number of operands i could conceive of an implementation of calccpp in which the n command is ignored iff the stack is empty but i am not sure if i am supposed to handle that case or if i am supposed to crash the program in that case ie require as a precondition that there be 1 or more operands in the stack and halt the program if the precondition is violated
student,for rational constructor with 2 inputs are we checking invariants after reducing the fraction to lowest terms if not are we reducing to lowest terms within the checkinvariants function before asserting that numerator and denominator are in lowest terms
student,when it says to eliminate any common factors for invariant 2 should we do that in the checkinvariants function or in the function that calls checkinvariants
student,i have the following errors in listcompilecheckcpp without changing any code is this just an issue with xcode
student,how do we check for self assignment in the operator overload function doing ifthis rhs leads to an error because its comparing an arrayintvector with a const arrayintvector
student,i am creating a checkinvariants function the invariant 1 for rational class states that denominator must be greater than or equal to 0 spec states that invariants do not apply to the two parameters passed in to the constructor thus denominatorin parameter can be arbitrary integers could be negative and the constructor should always succeed whch means i cannot use assert function inside constructors however the spec does not say what to do when denominatorin is negative what value should i give to denom when it is negative
student,whats a suggested timeframe for project 5 how much should each file take from my time thanks
student,hello i am looking at iterator for listh first of all i am not sure of what iterator does because the spec does not go into much detail as to what iterator does in addition what is a good way to know which additional member variables and which additional friend declarations are needed in the iterator class i know for sure that a nextptr and a prevptr for iterator would be useful due to the nature of iterator popping into the middle of a list and inserting searching or deleting objects thanks joshua
student,why would i do this i would multiply a pointer by another pointer for what purpose
student,so iterator in list appears to be a class within the list class definition im not sure i understand why this is important what it does and how its supposed to work outside the scope of listh
student,if im understanding this correctly in order to perform insertion and deletion you need to manipulate the pointer the iterator i contains how can i access the pointer if its a private member variable
student,why is the t optional for the parameters of the copy constructor and overloaded assignment operator but is needed for the return value of the assignment operator
student,the spec says infinity anything will result in undefined just to make sure you really mean anything right even zero
student,if i replace cout 0 with cout 0 is there any detectable difference does cout convert the integer to a string anyway
student,id like to implement a checkinvariants function like in lab09 for my rational class however since one isnt defined in the header file is it impossible for me to write one that can access private members
student,i have a question about checking the first invariant for the rational constructor according to the spec invariant 1 denominator must always be greater than or equal to 0 numerator can only be negative 0 or positive how should we handle a negative denominatorin input to the constructor should we assert that denominatorin is not negative or just change the value of the input in the implementation
student,do we have a lab due this week
student,im a bit confused about the effects of the prototypes on lines 35 39 and 66 in listhstarter copied below with their rmes modifies this effects inserts i into the front of the list 35 void pushfrontconst t datum modifies this effects inserts i into the back of the list 39 void pushbackconst t datum modifies this effects copies all nodes from l to this 66 void copyallconst listt other in the first two what is i and what is the el in the last im guessing they correspond to datum and other but i want to make sure before i start
student,so for my lab09 i do something like this copy each address from data to temp then delete data data 0 data temp when i delete data how am i not freeing all the memory that i put in temp too its the same address so theoretically its the same memory that was just freed right when i dereference the new data though it works just fine just a little confused how this works thanks
student,i keep getting the message even after completing all the steps any idea on what is causing it
student,when i try to run lab 9 it outputs the correct vsize 100 and vat99 2 correctly but then it gives error in lab09 free invalid next size fast and im not sure what this means
student,not sure how to fix this error message homeeecs280lab09lab09cpp8 undefined reference to arrayintvectorarrayintvectorint ive included the h file but it cant find this constructor for some reason
student,i think im deleting too many times we need to delete the array that is being copied in grow and then we need to delete the final data in the destructor correct im getting correct arrays and im not leaking memory but i am getting error summary 335 errors from 16 contexts suppressed 2 from 2 if it isnt this what else could it be thank you
student,does anyone have an idea as to why i definitely lost 20 bytes in 1 block
student,when i was doing step 4 for part 2 in lab 9 i got the rather large comment from the code this happened after i wrote delete data can someone explain to me what is happening
student,my valgrind output is posted below i am unsure as to whether or not having memory listed as still reachable or suppressed constitutes not being valgrind clean and if so how to resolve those leaks thanks for the help in advance 35941 35941 heap summary 35941 in use at exit 38634 bytes in 422 blocks 35941 total heap usage 514 allocs 92 frees 46222 bytes allocated 35941 35941 4096 bytes in 1 blocks are still reachable in loss record 80 of 80 35941 at 0x10000bea1 malloc vgreplacemallocc303 35941 by 0x1002c0696 smakebuf in usrlibsystemlibsystemcdylib 35941 by 0x1002d51e7 swsetup in usrlibsystemlibsystemcdylib 35941 by 0x1002bf930 sfvwrite in usrlibsystemlibsystemcdylib 35941 by 0x1002bff0a fwrite in usrlibsystemlibsystemcdylib 35941 by 0x10002bd29 std1stdoutbufcharoverflowint in usrliblibc1dylib 35941 by 0x10002887f std1basicostreamchar std1chartraitschar putchar in usrliblibc1dylib 35941 by 0x100001a38 main ostream1034 35941 35941 leak summary 35941 definitely lost 0 bytes in 0 blocks 35941 indirectly lost 0 bytes in 0 blocks 35941 possibly lost 0 bytes in 0 blocks 35941 still reachable 4096 bytes in 1 blocks 35941 suppressed 34538 bytes in 421 blocks 35941 35941 for counts of detected and suppressed errors rerun with v 35941 error summary 0 errors from 0 contexts suppressed 18 from 18

student,in the grow function is it ok to just write a for loop to copy over the elements from the old array to the new array or is there a more efficient way to do this
student,so i have a segfault so i run good ole valgrind and get this invalid write of size 4 i mean i know thats what the problem is but im confused as to why valgrind is able to finish the process and why in just normal run of it it seg faults after the first error since it still prints the first call to grow is my pointer going off the bounds of my memory but later fixing itself so it segfaults but valgrind still knows whats up
student,ive installed valgrind on mac and when i checked the lab09 it gave out leak message but when i double checked using valgrind on caen it said no leak anyone knows why
student,im confused that if we double datacapacity each time would we get 2100 after the for loop in main this is beyond the int or unsigned int range right

student,i was wondering if the solutions to the practice problems would be posted since i was unable to go to the last review session and would like to check my work on a related note will there be other oh review sessions i would definitely be interested in going if so thanks
student,i seem to be getting a seg fault and im not sure 100 sure where the problem is i get a seg fault after grow was called capacity is now 81920
student,the correct file has the command line thing at the top and thats the only reason im failing the diff on terminal do we need to print the whole line in the out file because im failing the autograder as well but im 100 sure the output is the same except the first line thanks
student,hi for my most recent submission im not passing any of the euchre tests for both the simple player tests im passing on the caen environment and im valgrind clean im even trying to use other flags to see if i can identify the bug toolexpsgcheck im stumped as to what to do sdiff and diff are telling me my output is identical to the correct output thanks
student,hi i used sdiff euchretest00outcorrect euchretest00out and i got this output i cant understand what its saying i just checked my program i have nothing else in cout other than endl or n has anyone else had a similar problem thanks screenshotpng
student,i have the following valgrind error that i know has to do with a vector but i have little idea as to how to fix it any insight would be highly appreciated
student,do my asserts need to be in a function i simply just put it all in maincpp and neatly separated tests for different functions i could see why this would be useful in playertests but i dont see the point in cardtests would i lose points for this
student,hello our project is getting 99 on ag but i decided to run it in valgrind just to be sure there were no leaks that might be picked on down the road valgrind reports the following which i have not seen before whats the consensus on this the only objects we allocated on the heap were those in playerfactory are we supposed to be able to delete those somehow i cant figure out how thanks for the help bash42 valgrind euchre 34572 memcheck a memory error detector 34572 copyright c 20022013 and gnu gpld by julian seward et al 34572 using valgrind3100 and libvex rerun with h for copyright info 34572 command euchre 34572 usage euchre packfilename shufflenoshuffle pointstowin name1 name2 name3 name4 34572 34572 heap summary 34572 in use at exit 8 bytes in 1 blocks 34572 total heap usage 19 allocs 18 frees 514 bytes allocated 34572 34572 leak summary 34572 definitely lost 0 bytes in 0 blocks 34572 indirectly lost 0 bytes in 0 blocks 34572 possibly lost 0 bytes in 0 blocks 34572 still reachable 8 bytes in 1 blocks 34572 suppressed 0 bytes in 0 blocks 34572 rerun with leakcheckfull to see details of leaked memory 34572 34572 for counts of detected and suppressed errors rerun with v 34572 error summary 0 errors from 0 contexts suppressed 2 from 2 bash42
student,ace of clubs jack of spades jack of clubs king of hearts queen of clubs led card suit clubs trump spades will the player not play jack of clubs since it is the left bower
student,hi for lab09 could someone please explain on a deeper level why is a destructor needed for the abstract base class intvector but not for the derived class arrayintvector and why is there no destructor for the derived class thank you for the clarification
student,i have the following error according to valgrind basicstringsconstruct null not valid however i have a 99 on the autograder and i only get this error with euchretest50 only when i read in from euchretest50in writing in the inputs manually leads to correct completion of the game is that an issue in my code and should i be worried about it and could it potentially impact my grade if an error like that arises even though my programs output is correct
student,the spec says when it is the human player’s turn to lead or play a trick first print the player’s hand for consistency with the autograder test cases print the cards in ascending order as defined by the operator in cardh but are we supposed to sort the cards to before we print to the human player during making trump or during discarding
student,hi in hand 0 the lead suit is spades and alice doesnt have spades so shes supposed to play the lowest card in her hand why does she play nine of diamonds when the lowest card in her hand is ace of clubs given that bob orders up hearts thanks
student,im pretty sure we deleted every player we created but valgrind still shows a memory leak somewhere what could be the problem
student,i am getting 89 on the autograder and so my project is working fine well mostly but i am not able to meet the card validity check there is only one requires clause in card and i have check a bad input and it exits with a 1 but the autograder wont give me the point i am really unsure of what could be wrong the requires cause is very easy
student,appendix b says it wants the format to be human player bob please enter a suit or “pass” bob passes but shouldnt it be the following to if the user typed in pass human player bob please enter a suit or “pass” pass bob passes
student,ive tested my playercpp and it works as my euchre works as well however in playertests on the autograder it says my return code is incorrect when i run the program through my computer i get no asserion failures all my test functions with different scenario passed in one specific function i gave some conditions to orderup and it evaluated to false so i had assertorderup false however i keep getting errors through caen saying that this assertion statement fails when i know its false yet gdb tells me that its true but through visual studio i can clearly see that it evaluated to false i also made sure to delete the players at the end as well any ideas
student,i was wondering how exactly our test cases should look like initially i made functions such as testmaketrump and within the function i would have many assert lines for various possibilities but i think that each function is only supposed to have 1 assert if this is the case could i have a testmaketrump function that just initializes the player and adds cards to their hands and then pass the player into various functions to test multiple possiblities with the same hand
student,im having a weird issue with using sort in my maketrump function for the human player class the error output is rather overwhelming but says error no match for operaton i use sort for several of my other functions in exactly the same way but have no problem with it anyone have any idea what might be going on
student,im having a bit of trouble figuring out how to deal the cards without using an obscene amount of for loops and if statements to stay in bounds of the players vector i obviously dont want an answer of how exactly it should be implemented but if anybody had any subtle hints for a less complicated approach id really appreciate it
student,in both versions of playermaketrump im explicitly setting orderupsuit to some spades hearts etc as appropriate but its not changing at all is anyone else having this issue
student,is there going to be another review session this week like the one last sunday
student,can someone help me with this error i am getting when trying to compile packcpp bash42 bash42 g wall werror o1 pedantic packcpp packh usrlibgccx8664redhatlinux483lib64crt1o in function start text0x20 undefined reference to main tmpccutanm9o in function packpackstdstring const packcpptext0x146 undefined reference to cardcardstdstring const stdstring const collect2 error ld returned 1 exit status bash42
student,hi my euchrecpp compiles without any errors but when i do euchre and then the 11 arguments nothing happens the bash42 line disappears and i have to manually close terminal to end the program i tried using valgrind but that too never finished running anyone come across the same problem or know whats the problem thanks
student,i am receiving this error when trying to create an ifstream object in packcpp packcpp in constructor ‘packpackconst string’ packcpp2834 error no matching function for call to ‘stdbasicifstreamcharopenconst string’ filenamepackopenpackfilename
student,
student,all of our tests are finished and everything works great we compiled it on caen linux our tests and all public tests for every file worked great when run from the terminal however when submitted to the auto grader we got an 89 and it said that playerpublictestcpp failed to compile i redownloaded the test file from the google drive redownloaded every single h file it still works on caen linux but the autograder still says it wont compile why is it doing this is there anything else i can try
student,are we supposed to disable our assert statements for our final productsubmission
student,after going through the pinned list for compiling on your end failing on autograder my partner and i are still failing the student simple player tests validity check it does really compile on our end no h files have been modified neither has the makefile we are valgrind clean we are not including anything we shouldnt we pass all of our test cases and our output at least on the euchre tests given is all correct my partner and i have gone through every line of playercpp and playertestscpp and checked the logic of our assertions nothing seems off to us but we still manage to fail that one autograder case can one of the staff give us a pointer hahaha as to where we might be going wrong here thanks
student,when i create a private variable for my player file i created private vectorcard playerhand i get this error playercpp12618 error invalid use of member ‘ simpleplayerhand ’ in static member function vectorcard playerhand how do i fix this error i have no idea why this is coming up
student,are we supposed to cout humans hand and the sentence for asking an input in functions of human player class
student,ie there are no duplicates i apologize if this has already been askedi tried searching but didnt find anything thanks
student,the rme tells us to use return new simplename or return new humanname when i do this i get an error for some reason i used the defaults constructor at the begging of simple simpleconst stdstring namein namenamein so i why am i getting this error
student,do i need a test function for playerfactory function
student,when i run valgrind for player tests it comes out saying 0 errors but it also says it suppressed 2 from 2 does this mean i am valgrind clean all of my files pass in the autograder so does this mean im fine
student,i tried to read through some posts on here but was still unsure does being valgrind clean simply mean when you run valigrind you dont receive any errors thanks
student,dear instructors just to clarify this issue when we have an upcard of 9 of heartsits round 2 so we should order up diamonds or pass here i just wonder does jack of hearts gonna be considered as a face card of diamonds because its the left bower if we order up diamonds a more specific example is we have 5 cards jack of hearts jack of hearts jack of hearts nine of spades ten of spades and here in round 2 should we order up diamonds because we have 3 left bowers thank you so much
student,so whenever i compile my playercpp i get these error messages g wall werror pedantic cardcpp playercpp playerpublictestcpp o playerpublictest playercpp in constructor ‘ simpleplayersimpleplayerstdstring ’ playercpp2729 error ‘ simpleplayernumofcards ’ will be initialized after werrorreorder int numofcards playercpp27118 error ‘ stdvectorcard simpleplayerhand ’ werrorreorder vectorcard hand playercpp205 error when initialized here werrorreorder simpleplayerstring namein playercpp in constructor ‘ humanplayerhumanplayerstdstring ’ playercpp4639 error ‘ humanplayernumofcards ’ will be initialized after werrorreorder int numofcards playercpp46218 error ‘ stdvectorcard humanplayerhand ’ werrorreorder vectorcard hand playercpp2875 error when initialized here werrorreorder humanplayerstring namein there may be an issue with the simpleplayer and humanplayer constructors but im not sure how to fix this
student,after someone submits their cpp files to the autograder it gives links that are available to view the the code that was submitted in the browser window there are indentingspacing issues mostly just extra space in the browser display of my code that are not there when i view it in an editor is stylegrading done within this browser window if so would the extra indents caused by this view affect our grading
student,are we responsible for testing our operator for cards
student,when were writing helper functions for euchrecpp a lot of the requires clause such as having cards in the deck is already stated in the other functions that were calling within these helper functions should we rewrite these in our newly written rmes
student,in round 2 of making if the simple player has queen of hearts 9 of spades 10 of spades ace of hearts and 9 of clubs and the upcard is a 10 of hearts would the player choose to order up the answer is no right since there are no diamond face cards if the simple player would choose to order up here can someone explain why thanks
student,how do we test human player by running euchretest50intext at the command line
student,for simple player strategy if trump is led for example spades and you have two cards the ace of spades and the jack of clubs would you play the ace of spades or the jack of clubs isnt the jack of clubs considered trump so you would play that
student,i dont get it why is my return code code but my output code different checked sdiff they appear to be exactly the same
student,when is vidals review session
student,say the upcard is hearts and this is the second round of making trump so the suit to order up would be diamonds if a player had jack of hearts in their hand does this count as a face card for the diamonds suit
student,do we need to write new rmes for the derived functions
student,our code prints out the right output for all of the simple tests on caen and works with human but for some reason still wont compile on the autograder we have checked piazza a bunch of times as well and are unsure of how to get past this issue 1 we use the given make functions through makefile and compile on caen 2 we have unmodified h files and redownloaded to make sure 3 we are valgrind clean valgrind says no possible leaks 4 we are not using any includes we shouldnt be 5 we pass our own test cases and the all public test cases on caen but not publicplayertests on autograder 6 not compiling on autograder 7 unsure of what to do
student,my partner and i are getting a strange bug that we cant seem to figure out if we have a card called jd set to the jack of diamonds and we call cout jd led by we expect to see jack of diamonds led by but were seeing jack of diamonds led by however this only happens when we use the makefile to run the tests and it works when we do it manually whats going on
student,my partner submitted the project and i can see the grade on the autograder do i also have to make a submit of the same files in order to receive that grade i made previous submits with a lower grade so i just want to sure i get the correct grade
student,do we assume the cards used in our operators are always valid input and if not can we check using assert
student,do we have to check invariant before and after the member function what should i check for card class pack class and player class i cannot think of the invariances in these classes
student,when i manually enter the input data for euchretest50 it runs to completion and prints the correct output however when i call euchre with input from the in file i get a segmentation fault why is that happening
student,should all of our functions in euchrecpp be declared static and does this include main
student,when i run my euchre program with euchretest50 in the terminal and use diff to compare with the correct output i get no differences however when i submit my files to the autograder it says that the output is incorrect anyway to test the output of my program further
student,my output is the same for my public tests but i am failing them when i submit on autograder yes i have compiled on caen any thoughts
student,does the order of cards in a hand matter i can think of a couple different ways to remove a card when leading playing which would result in a different order of cards in the hand after discarding i dont think this should affect program output but want to make sure the autograder isnt going to expect specific hand orders
student,from what i understand messages to print for human player are implemented in human but print messages for functions like playcard for simple player are implemented within euchre so how do we know that the player is simple to invoke printing a message in euchre im pretty sure we cant know in euchre whether player is simple or human so i dont understand how we check if the player is simple in order to print messages
student,should we print out march when a team does march or only print out when euchred
student,im going through my implementation for cardtests extensively trying to find out where i may have wrong logic but im not finding anything that is causing my return code to be incorrect i already checked that i am including only the things that i need and i dont see anything wrong with the logic could a possible reason for the error be that i am comparing the same 2 cards when testing cardless what other issues could be causing this anyone who has fixed stuff in their code to get return code to be correct please let me know what you did thanks
student,to see if the dealer and the player are the same player i read some posts saying that if the dealer is also the stuff that this points to then you know youre at the dealer what does this mean
student,will we be expected to handle cases where players have the same names
student,i assume that the add and discard function is to be used for making the trump in round 1 where the dealer needs to pick up the upcard and discard his lowest card based on this assumption would the trump be the suit of the upcard
student,my packtestscpp is passing but when i run euchrecpp i keep getting a segfault in my packshuffle function i use for loops to initialize two vectors one of the first 17 the other of the last 7 cards when trying to pushback the elements from the cards vector into the new vector im getting a segfault and i absolutely cannot figure out why this is the code causing the error vectorcard first17 for unsigned int i 0 i 17 i first17pushbackcardsatnexti error here i dont know if i should be using nexti or just i both work with packtests can someone please help me out i only posted this to the instructors in case posting it to the class would be breaking the rules or something thank you in advance for your assistance

student,so i know that this is failing due to exiting with a non zero status however i cannot for the life of me figure out which assert statements the correct implementation is failing i just went through line by line and it should pass every assert statement based on my years of understanding from being a michigan born and raised euchre player also i am failing the euchre tests with incorrect output even though when i run them through an online diff checker i get identical files any help would be appreciated
student,i am passing all my asserts in my test files and i checked my outputs with sdiff and they returned no difference between the files but i am still failing the autograder tests for these
student,how could i use the operator comparing two cards
student,are we supposed to write the code for deleting players inside the players function ive deleted the players in euchrecpp without the players
student,i seem to be failing the validitychecks of my boolean operator functions but im not entirely sure whats wrong with them im hoping someone will come up to me and give me a really obvious answer that ive been overlooking assertoperatortwohearts jackhearts assertoperatoracehearts acespades assertoperatoracespades acehearts assertoperatoracespades jackhearts thanks
student,i just want to make sure that this command euchre packin noshuffle 1 alice simple bob simple cathy simple drew simple euchretest00out takes the output of our euchrecpp and puts it into euchretest00out is this assumption correct thanks
student,i am going over my test cases again and i am confused about one of them led is king of hearts trump is hearts players hand ace of hearts jack of diamonds and queen of hearts would playcard for these parameters return jack of diamonds or ace of hearts
student,hello are we allowed to have a long series of static const variables for our test files such as various cards all the suits all the ranks names for players
student,hello im having difficult getting my popback to remove the last element im calling it correctly but it doesnt work i instead have six cards in my hand and am failing my assert tests since no card is being discarded
student,i understand we have to sort the player hand in maketrump when we are printing the players hand right the spec suggests using stdsorthandbegin handend to do this would this take into account the rank and suit of the cards
student,if our tests pass the autograder does that mean the asserts in our test are correct
student,for example 2 spades 8 clubs etc will including these types of cards in playertests cause the autograder to fail
student,i noticed a strange error in my shuffle function the way i implemented the shuffle function was put simply by using vectors to hold values and switch them around it works perfectly for the pack and passes the test but if i try to shuffle it at all after the initial shuffle its as if nothing happens to clarify the pack remains how it is after one shuffle even after three or four shuffles ive been stuck on this for quite some time and im kinda stumped has anyone had a similar problem or any insight into what could be causing this issue andor how to fix it
student,i am having problems with initializing the pack when reading it in i used the lecture slides as a base to read in the pack but every time i try to read it in i get my error message i changed packin to packtxt and it ran correctly in xcode however in caen it still cant read it in any advice as to how to get around this

student,when we consider making trump in round 2 the spec says during round two a simple player will order up the suit with the same color as the upcard if they have one or more face cards of that suit in their hand say the upcard was a club initially and making trump has reached round 2 so the same color suit would be spades if we had the jack of club in our hand qualifying as the left bower for spades would we count that as a face card per the spec and thus order up spades just looking for clarification
student,i am getting incorrect output on the autograder but when i run the tests on caen i get nothing incorrect from sdiff here is an image of my sdiff output no clue why autograder would say that we are also valgrind clean
student,should we delete the new player in playertestscpp if i dont delete it i sometimes get bugs when i run the program in my computer however there is no bug when i run the program in the caen i am very confused about it does this happen because my computers memory is too small by the way i always get bugs when i delete the new player in playertestscpp help
student,weve tried it with and without a newline at the very end and both failed were at a loss of what is wrong
student,our euchre code is passing all the valgrind tests and we are getting everything right on the autograder however we are having this weird valgrind error by 0x407163 staticinitializationanddestruction0int int cardcpp45 cardcpp45 refers to the const string card variables that were given to us by you guys in the starter code valgrind is giving errors for all of these card declarations is this a problem that we should be worried about
student,when they spec tells us to give the player the option to discard the upcard what would you input to tell the program to discard not discard the upcard
student,can i test my xyzcpp against someone elses xyztestscpp i assume not but this could be really helpful so im asking anyway
student,can we print the error message in player factory if the type is not simple or human
student,for testing packcpp and for writing the implementations to the pack functions should they be written for a pack of any size or can we assume that a euchresized deck of 24 cards will be used
student,ive written a printhandconst vectorcard function in the private section of the human class but i cant call the function in maketrump or anywhere else i added this function to accomplish the same format as whats going on in appendix b am i calling printhand wrong isnt it in the right place
student,what does the in virtual const stdstring getname const mean
student,for functions like addanddiscard and leadcard we assume we have a sorted hand right
student,will i get points deducted if i dont have many helper functions in euchrecpp i have around 200 lines of code in main right now
student,when i try to declare a variable of type card in my game struct like this card upcard i get an error that no matching function was found it seems that instead of seeing card as a type it sees it as a function is there a way around this
student,can i make a private member function in playercpp and would it have to be static
student,hi do we have latedaya in this course
student,is this the correct output when the dealer is supposed to pick up a card or should there be another end line before the next card is played thanks for your help
student,when the human player is prompted to pick a card to discard or discard the upcard if they decide to discard a card other than the upcard do they replace the card they discarded with the upcard in their hand
student,sorry if this is a dumb question but i missed a few lectures and am trying to get caught up what is intset for exactly and what does it have to do with the big three thanks
student,i have checked all over piazza but nobody has answered this specific question i understand that humans will follow the rules but will they behave the same way that simple players do in other words i know that they wont try to cheat round 1 in making trump but in round 2 will they only order up the next suit of the upcard or can they order up any suit they wantas long as its not the upcard i ask this because for my maketrump for human player when i assign orderupsuit to the human input which i read in as a string i dont get anything after the line bob ordered up when i assign orderupsuit using the suitnext function everything works just fine so if the humans dont have to follow the same behavior yes i know they will follow the rules as simple players then how exactly should i go about assigning orderupsuit correctly is there a way i can use the constants from the card file should i
student,for simple player is this used for screw the dealer how does the dealer decide which card in the deck to discard is it the lowest
student,hello when we cout things such as player bob leads card something is it okay to have that cout command in the ledcard function in the playercpp file or will this result in a lower grade thanks for your help
student,im confused about a few things from lecture 18 how many different ways are there to copy things why are their different ways and when would you need shallow vs deep copy thanks
student,i am a little confused as to how to invoke screw the dealer for simple player how do we check if the player playing the hand is the dealer i saw some posts about using dynamic memory and this keyword but am still confused
student,our tests fail the autograder when we assert the ten of spades is not less than the ten of clubs and assert that the ten of clubs is not less than the ten of spades we pass when we say less than or equal to theres other tests that fail too when it is strictly less than should it be less than or equal to
student,for sorting the player hand im wondering if i can just add another member function to humanplayer that does this for me just a void function that would sort the current hand if i did this if i did this would i put the function in between the brackets for humanplayer or outside where player factory is my other question is assuming im allowed to do this if i would have to declare this function static or not
student,problems with human player i feel like there might be a problem with the way im inputting the order up suit into the terminal when i run against the public test for human players when bob orders up hearts should we output into the terminal hearts without double quotes or should it be something else
student,say for instance that the trump is diamonds and a persons hand contains all diamonds except for a jack of hearts which is the right bower if the right bower is the highest trump card in the hand meaning that it is returned when leadcard is called is the returned card going to be jack of diamonds or jack of hearts
student,when i run euchre euchretest50in euchretest50out my euchretest50out file doesnt have anything written in it my euchre file runs correctly when i run it like euchre packin noshuffle 1 etc any ideas on why my code is not outputting into euchretest50out
student,im getting a contact your administrator error on the autograder is the autograder currently down i havent seen any other information that suggests it is right now
student,it appears to me that the infile does not have enough inputs and my program wants an input for the last card played inputs are pass pass pass hearts 2 discarded by dealer tricks below 4403 3020 0020 1010 000
student,in euchre i have a function that plays tricks based on a vector of cards however when initializing the vector i get two errors left operand of comma operator has no effect werrorunusedvalue vector stack lead played1 played2 played3 and conversion from ‘card’ to nonscalar type ‘stdvector’ requested vector stack lead played1 played2 played3 what am i missing
student,my return code for playertests is incorrect on the autograder even though it runs without error and is errorfree according to valgrind what else could be causing the return code to be incorrect
student,im getting this compile error but im confused as to why i implemented all the functions in playercpp that were given in playerh for both classes thanks
student,for errors that are in the form bytes in 1 blocks are possible or definitely lost in loss record in valgrind how do i go about debugging the information given with the error seems useless as no line numbers are given
student,for simple player why is trump a function parameter in the playcard function if a simple player is only supposed to play the highest led suit card or their lowest card
student,im making my tests for card and when i copy and pasted the tests in the public tests from cardpublictests just to get a base test adding more and try to compile i get an error with assert cardtestscpp2212 error expected unqualifiedid before ‘ ’ token asserttwospadesistrumpcardsuitclubs and this error came up for all of the assert functions that used the operator how do i fix this i also got a cout error cardtestscpp395 error ‘ cout ’ does not name a type cout cardtests passed endl
student,after each hand i reset the pack however for some reason after the first hand the pack seems to have decremented and each player is having repeats of cards in their hand after spending a while trying to find the error i was wondering if anyone else had this issue and how you dealt with it or if anyone has any advice or insight on what this could be thank you
student,because our simple player is being tested do we need to separate our test functions into simple and human so we have testhumangetname and testsimplegetname for example or can we just have a general testgetname where we test both types
student,hello in my euchre file i have a helper function called determine trump that should determine the trump by using the maketrump function however it is not changing the orderupsuit and is keeping it diamonds the entire game what could be my probe here in maketrump i always assign orderupsuit upcardsuit or orderupsuit othersuit before i return not sure what is going wrong
student,see title
student,can we use string stream in project 4 please
student,not super important cause i figured out my one problem without valgrinds help but when i ran make debug and then ran the resulting euchre with valgrind it didnt output any of the cool file and line information of the errors i had even when i commented things out to intentionally create errors valgrind should catch uh help also what does valgrind clean mean exactly zero errors at all zero important errors but some supressed errors further information muchos gracias
student,student simple player tests validity check compilation success return code incorrect score for student simple player tests validity check total 01 im failing this part of the autograder what does this mean i even checked to make sure im not violating any requires clauses for the player test cases and im not
student,can names inputed in euchre have spaces in them
student,do we need to create our own input files to test the pack functions or can we do all our testing using just packin
student,ive checked my output for euchretest50 in numerous diff checkers and my code outputs the exact same as whats in euchretest50outcorrect im not sure where to even begin to fix thisplease help
student,i want to ask my question over an example during making trump section lets say the upcard is ten of diamonds and the simple players hand is queen of diamonds king of diamonds ace of diamonds nine of spades nine of clubs if we were to call maketrump with round 2 should it return false since there are no face hearts cards in the hand in a normal game this situation would never happen since the player would have ordered up in the first round anyway but should we be explicitly changing what it would return if this were to be the situation the autograder solutions and my code seems to disagree on what it returns in this case thanks in advance
student,so im trying to make a vector of cards as a private member variable for both subclasses of player named hand but it keeps saying expected primaryexpression before hand when i try to compile i have no idea what this means and ive googled it so hard so any help you can offer would be great
student,is there such a thing as testing too much or testing too much of something trivial for example would it be worth it to check that every card in a deck is in the correct position after shuffling and then shuffling the deck again and rechecking positions for every card also would we be penalized for testing too much especially because the tests are handgraded
student,so i just ran across this when i was playing a quick game of euchre as a break between writing test cases when i was playing a game with three computers and one human me when i was prompted to select a card i input end instead of the card to play and the game finished by itself without any human input it played cards from my hand without input and played the game as if there was four computer players neither my partner or i have any code in place for this functionality if its even a function is this just something weird going on behind the scenes confused and intrigued
student,based off the example in the public test say my hand is twospades twospadestwospadestwospadestwospades ninespades i want to remove the lowest i know twospades is the lowest so if there are multiple instances of the lowest card in my hand would i remove the first one that occurred so the twospades on the far left would be the one that is removed thanks
student,hey so i am having trouble running my playercpp there is the error no matching function for call to simpleplayer and the same error for human player i have read previous posts on piazza on this post and had my printcards function changed but i am still experiencing this error please help
student,is the autogravder test case euchretest50 different than the public euchretest50 because when i run that test case on caen i get euchre packin noshuffle 1 alice human bob human cathy human drew human euchretest50in euchretest50out diff q euchretest50out euchretest50outcorrect bash42 diff s euchretest50out euchretest50outcorrect files euchretest50out and euchretest50outcorrect are identical but the autograder says im failing that test case
student,when i do sdiff out outcorrect i get random gaps on both out file columns my endlines are all correct and im valgrind clean so no memory leaks why is this happening to both sides
student,are we allowed to make the vector of cards that represents the players hand a public member variable this would make it much easier to order the cards in ascending order for human players
student,hi all im wondering if anyone knows how the hand graded points factor into our project grades im wondering because my auto grade scores and hand graded scores seem to have a higher score than my overall score for instance if i got x on my autograde on the second project and i got y on my hand graded points my project 2 autograder and recursion score is z this z is less than both x and y im not sure how this could be so id appreciate any clarification
student,for maketrump ive seen a post that says potential left bowers are considered in the 2nd round this applies to the first round as well correct
student,in order to test the functions in playercpp for example playcard function if the simple player have five cards in hand there are c525 ways to choose five cards from the deck so there are c525 different cases even if i can use a loop to test all of the c525 cases the playertests will be exceed the time limit if considering four three two cards in hand to play there will be even more cases any hints about how to choose the representative test cases
student,because add and discard is a void function how can we assert that the dealers hand is correct if we cant access the hand because it is private we are currently using cout and seeing that the hand is correct but we want to use assert thanks
student,so the only part of the autograder not compiling is the playerpublictest i followed the advice in 2313 to try and fix it on my own i redownloaded playerpublictestcpp the makefile and all the header files i then attempted to use valgrind to check if i was valgrind clean i read the 2 posts about valgrind and used the toolexpsgcheck flag to check playerpublictest valgrind returned me 16586 error summary 0 errors from 0 contexts suppressed 0 from 0 which looks like im valgrind clean i tried with the command leakcheckyes and got the following valgrind output 16786 error summary 0 errors from 0 contexts suppressed 2 from 2 does the suppressed 2 from 2 mean anything in regards to accessing out of boundsmemory leak ect how would i go about finding what line the issue is on if it is an out of bounds issue
student,in the main loop of the euchre game i am declaring and initilizing the card upcard each time i pass through the loop why does this not cause a problem with redeclaring upcard each time and is it ok to be doing this
student,ive read the previous posts about this but im still somewhat confused since we cannot declare a non const helper function to print the hand cant change h file nor declare a static helper outside of player nor use stdsort in the const maketrump function how are we supposed to print the humans hand in order in this function
student,when i try to use the sort function from algorithm my code is getting a ton of errors when i try to call sorthandbegin handend it says it has a problem passing const card what is my issue here
student,
student,should we have virtual player in our playercpp file or is it only needed in the header file thanks
student,what does it mean for the return code for cardtests to be incorrect
student,im really struggling to write a deal function for euchre i have initialized a pack of cards using my pack constructor from pack but now i am struggling to figure out how to use the cards in the pack so that i can deal them to the players i think that i want to put the cards in a vector to deal them idk im really stuck can anyone point me in the right direction
student,is it possible to go to office hours to review topics from lecture id really like to just talk one on one with someone for a little bit to make sure im grasping all the concepts
student,in terms of style is it better to have the main function below the helpers and struct declarations or above them or should it be between the struct declarations and the helper functions
student,the spec tells us to print a blank line after someone orders up when all the players are simple and not to print a new line if all the players are human do we print the blank line after someone orders up if theres a mix of human and simple players
student,i am getting the error saying submissions are disabled for this project while trying to submit
student,when compiling in xcode everything is running just fine however when i compile on caen i get many undefined references i have tried just about everything to fix this problem and could not find the solution for fun i included a cpp file keep in mind i had already included the h from the beginning that the function that had an undefined reference to was in and now it works what is going to be the best solution for me as i dont really want to submit something that includes a cpp file
student,when a dealer is a human and another player calls trump in round 1 due to the spec the dealer needs to now discard a card in appendix b it says to print the action then prompt the human dealer to pick a card to discard when these are printed is there an empty line between the declaration of what the player does to prompting the user for example does it go like alice orders up diamonds human player alices hand or alice orders up diamonds human player alices hand i initially believe it is the former as the spec says to print an extra new line after the player selects however i wanted to clarify this here as a miscommunication would be detrimental to the test cases
student,so i thought all of my functions were working completely right and was writing more tests to try to find mistakes and i had a question about the suit of the left bower i was testing play hand and gave my player a 9 of spades jack of spades jack of clubs an ace of hearts and a king of diamonds i set the led card to be an ace of spades but the trump suit is clubs at first glance i thought the card he would play would be the jack of spades seeing as he can follow the suit of the led card and the jack seems to be the highest card that follows suit seeing as led suit was spades however he played the 9 of spades i figured out that this was because i have my card function that considers trump when getting a cards suit setting the left bowers suit to be the trump suitseeing as the hint says the left bowers suit is the trump suit so instead of it being read as a jack with suit spades it says its a jack of clubs because of this when my function runs through the hand to find the highest card that can follow suit so my question would be is the nine of spades correct in this case or should i be using the get suit that doesnt take into account trump so that it reads the jack as a spades rather than a clubs
student,whats the easiest way to install valgrind onto a mac
student,can you do something like valgrind make test in linux to ensure that your files are all valgrind clean
student,is the autograder not working for anyone else it says there is an error for mine
student,when the spec says that simple players play the highest card in their hand that follows suit is that according to the sort function or the cardless function ie it it based on trump or just the operator same question but when the simple player plays the lowest card in their hand if they cant follow suit thanks

student,im just about out of ideas trying to see if anyone else might have some insight i have a function that deals out the hand after calling this function i call dealone to give me the upcard when i do this it gives me the first card in pack i havent reset the next pointer in euchrecpp or in dealone the line for making the upcard comes immediately after my dealhand function can anyone tell me why i might be getting the first item in the pack by the way i have cout all of the cards as i read them in from the pack and have verified they are being read in correctly none of them are repeats but when i dont read everything in all at once i apparently get a reset next without asking for one
student,i dont know if this is against da rules see attached photo but what does the desired shuffled deck look like after the shuffle function has run for packin we cant really understand what the desired deck is supposed to look like thanks
student,for hand 0 of euchretest01outcorrect alice is said to have the following hand after dealing a shuffled pack from packin ace of hearts queen of diamonds jack of diamonds ace of diamonds king of diamonds however i seem to generate a different hand and i dont know why nine of clubs ace of hearts queen of diamonds jack of diamonds king of diamonds as you can see the bolded cards differ am i not shufflingdealing correctly my shuffled packin is the following with alices hand bolded following the 32322323 dealing format queen of spades king of spades ace of spades nine of hearts ten of hearts jack of hearts queen of hearts king of hearts ace of hearts nine of clubs ten of clubs jack of clubs queen of clubs king of clubs ace of clubs nine of diamonds ten of diamonds jack of diamonds queen of diamonds king of diamonds ace of diamonds nine of spades ten of spades jack of spades what is the problem here
student,my pointer to a player from playerfactory will not allow me to use playerh functions can someone help me with this
student,i am very confused if someone orders up during round 1 that means the dealer is given the option of replacing hisher cards with the upcard i imagine this is when addanddiscard comes in handy but how can we replace the cards if one of them upcard is a const

student,we am having trouble figuring out why we are getting different output than the expected one for the first hand the expected output is ace of spades led by bob nine of hearts played by cathy queen of hearts played by drew ace of hearts played by alice bob takes the trick however when i looked at each of the hands i found that the bolded cards should have been played by each no one can follow suit so they should just be playing their lowest cards bob qs ks as 10c jc cathy 9h 10h qc kc ac drew jh qh kq 9d 10d alice ah 9c jd qd kd
student,we already finished the project but i heard someone said that we should use game strict do we have to do this
student,for the human player test in order to have the exact output and pass the autograder are we supposed to be reading in the euchretest50in file or are those just the proper commands to have it reach the exact output thanks
student,are we supposed to print the command line if it is formatted incorrectly or the pack file could not be opened
student,hello i was wondering if it actually matters in our code to differentiate between round 1 and round 2 for human maketrump i ask this because even if it gets to the point of screw the dealer we have no way of forcing the human player to choose a suit i would assume that when the spec says that the human player input will always be correct it includes the case that the human player must input something in the second round if heshe is the dealer is that reasonable thanks in advance
student,when we use the sort function on a vector of cards how does it know which cards have higher values than others how can it even work with cards since cards are udts i tried stack overflow but wasnt satisfied with any answers i could find
student,when i run the basic euchre packin noshuffle 1 alice simple bob simple cathy simple drew simple command in terminal i get what appears to be the correct output however when i run euchre packin noshuffle 1 alice simple bob simple cathy simple drew simple euchretest00out i get an out of range error on a vector however this doesnt come about until after the first trick was played jack of spades led by bob king of spades played by cathy ace of spades played by drew nine of diamonds played by alice drew takes the trick and then the program crashes anyone have a similar problem know of any potential problems
student,i am confused on the tip of making a game struct to help with euchrecpp also where would this struct be placed
student,the rme clauses in playerh do not say anything about having to print out any messages does this mean we are free to print out messages like bob passes in euchrecpp i would be putting it in a helper function i made for the process of making trump
student,can someone just give me a yae or nae on whether we need a hand class
student,i have no problems watching any of the other lectures but i cannot seem to access l17 i am trying the link on this page httpauereecsumichedueecs280f15 there is no med quality and i cannot access the high quality one httpauereecsumichedueecs280f15eecs280xf15l17highmp4 forbidden you dont have permission to access eecs280f15eecs280xf15l17highmp4 on this server apache247 ubuntu server at auereecsumichedu port 80
student,can i use include algorithm for sort
student,i know for cardcpp we had to use rankjack as opposed to making a string that said jack does the same hold true for our tests or are we safe to just use jack etc
student,spec says do not use global or static variables so what if i wanted to make a bool and void function for shuffle mode similar to the ones we had on util in project 3 i could just make it all one function but it feels like it might be easier if i split it into two like in project 3
student,in hand 1 of euchretest01outcorrect before cathy orders up clubs bobs hand is ace diamonds ten spades nine spades jack clubs queen clubs when cathy orders up clubs since bob is the dealer he must consider the upcard jack of spades the output file implies he throws the away the left bower which is the upcard aka jack of spades game logic says he should throw away the nine of spades because that is the lowest card in his hand when considering the 6 cards together ace diamonds ten spades nine spades jack clubs queen clubs jack of spades hand 1 bob deals jack of spades turned up cathy passes drew passes alice passes bob passes cathy orders up clubs jack of hearts led by cathy king of hearts played by drew ace of hearts played by alice nine of spades played by bob alice takes the trick king of diamonds led by alice ace of diamonds played by bob nine of hearts played by cathy jack of diamonds played by drew bob takes the trick ten of spades led by bob ten of hearts played by cathy nine of diamonds played by drew queen of diamonds played by alice bob takes the trick jack of clubs led by bob ace of clubs played by cathy ten of diamonds played by drew ten of clubs played by alice bob takes the trick queen of clubs led by bob king of clubs played by cathy queen of hearts played by drew nine of clubs played by alice cathy takes the trick bob and drew win the hand euchred alice and cathy have 1 points bob and drew have 2 points is this incorrect understanding of game logic
student,we attempted to compile playerpublictest both before and after fixing memory leak using the command line make playerpublictest we got this error and are not sure what to do bash42 make playerpublictest g wall werror pedantic cardcpp playercpp playerpublictestcpp o playerpublictest tmpcc6njn8mo in function main playerpublictestcpptext0xb4 undefined reference to operatorstdostream player const playerpublictestcpptext0x15b undefined reference to operatorstdostream player const collect2 error ld returned 1 exit status make playerpublictest error 1 we fixed the issue by modifying the code in publicplayertest as follows player human playerfactorynotrobot human cout human endl to player human playerfactorynotrobot human cout humangetname endl but are not sure if we are allowed to make a change like this to a file we technically are not supposed to touch can we leave our change in and assume that we will still pass the autograder tests for player or is there something else going wrong in our code that we are just not aware of
student,my implementation for cardscpp is fully functional and within the bounds of the spec as far as i can tell but doesnt use suitnamesbyweight ranknamesbyweight numsuits or numranks explicitly this throws warnings about unused variables when i go to compile my question is whether or not it is required to use these variables in our implementation or whether they were just suggestions given in the starter code to help us out and save us some typing thanks
student,i was going over my code and i noticed that in hand 3 of euchretest00out drew plays queen of clubs as a simple player drew is supposed to play the lowest card in his hand if he cannot follow suit which he cannot in this case his lowest card is nine of hearts why wouldnt he play that
student,i have tested my euchrecpp function on caen for euchretest50 and i have compared it with the correct output when i use the diff command i get no output which makes me feel like my program works correctly but when i submitted to the autograder i got that the return code was correct while output was incorrect i am not sure why i am failing the autograder so any help would be appreciated
student,so after a player plays their last card in their hand the hand should be empty but hand is a private member so you cant access it in playertestscpp if theres more than one card in the hand you can just test it using playcard or leadcard but are there any suggestions on how to confirm a hand is empty
student,i tried to run euchrecpp and i got a seg fault so i used valgrind and now i am getting a ton of multiple definition errors if im not including any cpp files does this just mean im including too many h files in the wrong places and can anything else be causing these errors
student,are we not allowed to use cardcpp in our playertestscpp the autograder is saying we failed but when we compile it with g playerpublictestcpp playercpp cardcpp o playerpublictest it works completely fine and says we pass everything but the autograder says we failed thanks
student,when the pack is empty it means that the next is at at the end and it also means there are no cards in the pack so can we just assume that only when vector size is zero there are no cards in the pack or it is possible that it will be tested with empty vectors with a nonzero size
student,are we able to overload the operator for pack im using a game struct in euchrecpp and declared the pack in the struct i cant think of a better way to do it
student,after reading from files shall we set next 0 or it does not matter
student,can someone please remind me how i would change my space settings for when im typing up cpp files like if i wanted my tab to be the equivalent of 4 spaces when right now its 8
student,should we print out playername passes or playername orders up suit inside of the maketrump function or inside of euchrecpp this question also applies to playername leads with card inside of the leadcard function and playername plays card inside of the playcard function
student,im trying to run a function and keep receiving this message im not sure where to look in order to figure out what is causing this does anyone have any interpretation of this error messagean indication of where to find this
student,it looks like there has been some piazza discussion and a partial example in the spec but im not entirely sure of what the exact output should be when the dealer is given the option of addingdiscarding the upcard ive attached some output to hopefully make my question more clear after a player who is not the dealer orders up the trump suit do we print something about name orders up suit followed by an empty line followed by the prompt for the dealer as in the picture or should it be something different i dont see an exact example of this situation anywhere thanks
student,in the spec they give us this bit of code to delete the players after the game finishes playerfactory for int i 0 i intplayerssize i delete playersi playersi 0 this might not be important but i was just wondering if the playerfactory is actually necessary our code works when we just have for int i 0 i intplayerssize i delete playersi playersi 0 so i was just wondering if the playerfactory at the beginning is important and if so what does it do
student,please help me i do not know how to interpret these errors i was compiling the packpublictests using the makefile thank you
student,does follow suit include trump that is if the trump suit is spades and the players trump cards are jack of clubs and ten of spades will it play the jack of clubs
student,in the given test cases the players always order up immediately starting round two this never requires printing the playername passes command in the second round the spec is kind of vague about it so i was wondering if we still needed to print the playername passes even in the second round thank you
student,i keep getting the following error when using the sort function i included all the right headers as well
student,hi my partner and i are getting the wrong output on euchre test 50 on the autograder however we have been through our code the spec and the correct output multiple times without finding a difference we have visited the post httpspiazzacomclassidvybru9lww6gbcid2468 but the advice there did not help us find our errorcan you help us outthanks
student,quote from the spec cut the deck at 17 cards that is split the deck into two parts cards 0­16 and 17 ­23 and swap the two parts do this 3 times lets say 016 is v1 and 1723 is v2 does this mean that the new deck is v2 v1 and then we split again or do we just swap v1 and v2 3 times so it ends up being v2 v1
student,this file is only for helping us type in inputs for the out file right we dont need to make our game accept this as an input file right
student,i created a vector of pointers to player and i am trying to use playerfactory to to add the players to this vector however i am getting this error euchrecpptext0x36e undefined reference to playerfactorystdstring const stdstring const any ideas what i could be doing wrong
student,im having some trouble understanding how a hand is associated with a specific player does hand have to be a subclass of player
student,i have been using packcpp functions the constructor dealone and reset in my playertestscpp file to make it easier to create new hands for different players however because make playertests does not compile packcpp ive had to compile it on my own including packcpp because the makefile does not compile with packcpp does this mean that the autograder also does not and i should write my playertestscpp file differently so that i dont have to use the packcpp functions
student,do we have to implement the destructor for player
student,just for clarification are we meeting for discussion is there a discussion assignment due next week thanksgiving week thanks
student,should we have our playertests run human player tests because youautograder doesnt know the input we send our testing file it was failing the autograder because it broke from our test file and failed to delete memory resulting in a dirty valgrind result i commented out those human player tests and it passed the autograder perfectly
student,says the base class is inaccessible though im not using any private member variables what could be wrong
student,hi this is something i cant totally figure out despite how simple i am sure the solution is in round 1 if a suit has been ordered up and the human is the dealer how can we tell from inside the function that suit has been ordered up i know how to detect if the player is the dealer but how can i tell if a suit has been ordered up i was thinking about checking to see if orderupsuit is empty but i feel that might not always be the case and is not very reliable
student,for playerscpp what are the messages we are suppose to cout for the human class for the addanddiscard function i am having some trouble finding examples in the given correct output files
student,i am just a little bit confused and want to check on something so i can see that if we want to order trump then we have to actually change the orderupsuit and not just return true im used to doing things like this with voids and cant recall doing things like this with bools but i assume they work the same way as voids right i assume so but i just want to double check because again im more used to using voids in this regard thanks in advance
student,ive looked at a few different posts but cant seem to find a clear answer when the simple player has a jack of spades and a queen of spade in their hand with a led card of suit spades is the jack or the queen played first similarly if the trump suit is clubs and the led suit is spades is the queen or the jack of spades played first as per the players strategy ie is the jack always considered a higher than the other cards of the same suit i hope this isnt clearly outlined in the spec has been already answered thanks
student,in main are you able to access a variable that is a card upcard in your struct game and call a card function getsuit on it if so would it be like this gameupcardgetsuit thanks
student,cout usage euchre packfilename shufflenoshuffle pointstowin name1 name2 name3 name4 endl what is meant by this if there is an error reading in data are we supposed to print a message that says usage euchre with the all the other variables what if the error is that there are less than 12 command line arguments wouldnt we not have access to these variables
student,do the helper functions created in euchre have to be declared as static functions
student,would it be possible for me to declare a global constant vector after ive received the pointers for my players just to make it easier if i had helper functions that were returning certain vectors
student,is it incorrect to derive human from simple where simple is derived from player
student,i get the error nonstatic data member initializers only available with stdc11 or stdgnu11 when i initialize a card within my game struct the error happens because i need to initialize the card in the game constructor but when i do that i get the error constructor for game must explicitly initialize the member upcard which does not have a default constructor i also cant make this card a const global variable because its value will change so how do i initialize it without getting an error
student,im having the following segfault error im know the programs having trouble reaching a variable but i dont know which variable its having trouble with the gdb printout is pasted below cardisleftbower this0x611810 trumpdiamonds at cardcpp117 117 if next suit rank rankjack gdb stdoperatorchar lhshearts rhserror reading variable cannot access memory at address 0xa7362756c43204e at usrincludec482bitsbasicstringh2495 2495 return lhssize rhssize gdb program received signal sigsegv segmentation fault 0x00007ffff7b910d3 in stdstringsize const from lib64libstdcso6 gdb single stepping until exit from function znkss4sizeev which has no line number information program terminated with signal sigsegv segmentation fault

student,the pdf says if a team is marched or euchred to print out march and euchred and following will be a newline yet in the out files they provide us for what our ideal program should print out there is no newline so should was omit this spec
student,i wrote a helper function called void printhand in my human class and only call it in the functions in my human class but when i compile i get an error that says there is no matching function i understand that these helper functions cannot be used outside of the human class because it is not defined in player but i do not understand why it would not be working in the functions of my hulman class
student,since its possible in euchre for a team to get both euchred and marched would we print out just euchred march both
student,the project spec says each test must be implemented as its own function does this mean that you can only have one assert in each function or does it mean that you need to have a separate function for testing each behaviour of the functions in card pack and player
student,im confused as to what the arguments do and which one needs to be changed
student,when i upload my files to the autograder it says received but if i leave the page and come back it says i have no submissions is it maybe just a browser issue
student,is there a sizerun time limit for each set of test cases or anything else we upload to the autograder
student,hi when i try to make playertests i get a single compiler error that says i have an undefined reference to playerfactory in my playertestscpp i have made sure to include playerh in my testscpp file and ive implemented playerfactory in playercpp can someone tell me where im going wrong thanks
student,sort is causing trouble when working with simple players it is occasionally changing an ace to a nine of a different suit do we even need to use sort for simple players
student,for round 1 of making trump if the dealer wants to order up the upcard does the dealer still add and discard or is this in round 2
student,i am creating a vector of players for my game struct but i do not know how to initialize the vector without using the virtual class player since i do not know which type of player is going into my vector simple or human i tried using the generic player constructor but i now realize i cannot do that how can you make a vector of players without using the generic player
student,on the rme it says that for add card we can only do so if its less than the max hand size but doesnt the amount of your cards in your hand get one larger for the split second the dealer picks up the upcard my add card is buggy because of things
student,whats the difference
student,i am trying to use cardless in my addanddiscard function and i keep getting a no matching function call error any suggestions of what i am doing wrong here thanks
student,if points to win is 10 and we have 9 points but then we euchre we would have 11 points should we print out that we have 10 points or should we print out that we have 11 points thank you
student,i have been testing my outputs when inputting euchretest50in to euchretest50outcorrect when i put them side by side they look exactly the same i even went line by line and they were the same from what i saw when using less it outputs a huge blank space with lining the left side of the terminal i checked to make sure there is not spaces at the end of my outputs or anything like that i am stumped and i do not know what else to look for what should i also be looking for
student,in the euchretest50outcorrect it would seem that cathys hand is incorrectly ordered with clubs being ordered before spades however if the ordering was correct wouldnt spades come before clubs in ascending order i suppose a follow up would be has the outfile been updated
student,could someone tell me whats wrong
student,for our test files do we have to write test functions and call them in main or can we test all the functions in main using assert im asking because i wrote my cardtestscpp with just a bunch of asserttesting stuff in main and commenting what i was testing above each block of asserts just in case im writing the rest of my test files explicitly with test functions so should i rewrite move around the code for cardtestscpp so im calling test functions thanks
student,my partner and i have used sort in playercpp in non const functions but the vector after the use of sorthandbegin handend isnt sorting the vector it stays exactly the same
student,after we pass the autograder tests and our code seems to be working well does any one have advice on what to continue testing we feel confident in our test cases for card pack and player so should we just play our program and make sure it runs the way it should or could there be other things that we could be looking over
student,i keep getting this error message from the compiler where it claims it cant find the dealone function ive included packh but it cant seem to find it properly all my pack tests work g wall werror pedantic cardcpp packcpp playercpp euchrecpp o euchre euchrecpp in function ‘ void dealplayer const pack const player ’ euchrecpp3936 error no matching function for call to ‘ packdealone const ’ table1addcardpackdealone euchrecpp3936 note candidate is in file included from euchrecpp30 packh288 note card packdealone near match card dealone
student,do we need to change the options that are output to human players in the situation of a human player that is a dealer and screw the dealer eg human player bob please enter a suit rather than human player bob please enter a suit or pass yes i saw this question earlier on piazza but it was only answered by a student who was unsure could i get instructor verification on what the proper output should be
student,the spec says that we have to shuffle every round but it we are not told what it must shuffle the header file for the packh says that we dont remove cards when we deal them so i assume we shuffle the pack we had before we took tricks and dont take into account how the tricks were played but what the spec said can also be true if we collect all the cards we deal in a separate pack and shuffle the new pack when we play the next trick i just wanted to make sure that we shuffle that the code should we written using the the former methodology
student,hi im trying to implement the sort function from algorithm but im having massive error with the following note note candidate function the implicit copy assignment operator not viable this argument has type const card but method is not marked const class card this suggests its an error in my function yet all inputs to that are const and dont modify this vector any advice
student,when a simple player is determining whether or not to orderup do left bowers impact the decision or is it only cards that are strictly of the same suit fairly certain its the former but im not sure on the whole
student,do we have to include algorithm to use the sort function
student,i just started using sublime text to write my code but i would like to test it in caen and make sure it works in that environment how do i transfer the files other than copy pasting it
student,so i looked around some on piazza but havent found anything with my question lets say that a simple player has a jack of spades queen of spades king of spades king of diamonds and ace of diamonds the upcard was hearts which was turned down by all players it is now this players turn to order up trump do they order up diamonds or spades and why i understand some of the other cases like if there were just a bunch of nines and tens but the player had a king of diamonds then they would order up diamonds in that scenario i understand that we consider left bowers i looked and i dont think all scenarios are in the specs but maybe i missed something another question i have lets say again that the upcard was hearts and that it goes all the way around to the dealer again if the dealer has no face cards in hand how do they determine trump
student,so i know for packconst stdstring packfilename we need to write the error message if io fails what all is included in this fails should we print that message and exit if the pack isnt formatted correctly like ten spades instead of ten of spades what about if the file isnt as long as expected 0 23 cards also doesnt testing the instantiation require the creation of other packin files so wont the autograder not be able to find the files we used for testing purposes this goes for kind testing all of the different pack functions
student,if points to win is 10 and we have 9 points but then we euchre we would have 11 points should we print out that we have 10 points or should we print out that we have 11 points thank you
student,i wrote a member function removecard in my simple player class but when i create a player bob a simple player in my test function and attempt to call removecard it gives me this error
student,i ran cardtests through valgrind and it tells me at the bottom of the output 0 errors from 0 contexts suppressed 2 from 2 what does that suppressed 2 from 2 mean and is it a problem
student,each time we reshuffle for the next hand should we reshuffle the already shuffled hand or should we read back in our original pack and reshuffle from there i know if i did this it would repeat the first hand exactly i just want to be sure
student,for the simple and human player derived classes do they contain all of the same member variables and functions but just employ different implementations of them thank you
student,are we allowed or is it recommended to have functions within structs it compiles fine and works but i cant make it static would that be a problem thanks
student,after each hand do we just reset the deck of cards if no shuffle is on would this result in everyone having the same hand as the person to their right had in the one before and in shuffle mode would you reset the next pointer but the first index would be the first index of the shuffled deck and then you shuffle again thanks for your help
student,i created a helper function that prints out the hand dealer and upcard at the beginning of each hand but i am having trouble accessing the upcard from euchrecpp how can i do this so that i can send it to my helper function to print thanks
student,when i submit to the autograder i get a compilation failure when i try compiling on both my computer and a cain terminal my code compiles and runs the test cases as desire what should i do about that
student,we write the function addanddiscard but we dont know what card the dealer should pick where does it say how that decision is made in the spec
student,we will need to add and discard the the dealer anyways do we do it inside the maketrump function
student,how is this possible i am having trouble trusting auto grader i uploaded a file called playercpp that is blank and this test seems to be passing i am wondering if this is affecting the results on auto grader for other files that i have completed below is the output from the auto grader student simple player tests validity check compilation success return code correct score for student simple player tests validity check total 11
student,hello i have a bit of a problem with my vector of pointers to players i initialize it vectorplayer players but then when i try to add cards to it in deal by saying gameplayersindex addcarddeckdealone it gives me the error base operand of has no pointer type stdvectorplayer what problem am i having here thanks for your help
student,i am getting a segmentation fault error when i run the unit tests on caen for playercpp what does this mean and how can i fix it thanks
student,for the function bool maketrumpconst card upcard const player dealer int round stdstring orderupsuit const we are meant to make the computer return true if the it is the dealer in the 2nd round but what happens if two players have the same name
student,are we supposed to print out all of the content of argv the example output has it on the top of each file i figured they were there just to be convenient but i want to make sure
student,im not sure how to implement these functions to work for any vector for example if i wanted to find an element at a vector of say position 3 how could i do that i want to do intvector3 but that has an errordoesnt work for an instance of the class what am i supposed to do thanks
student,having more than one max point would make it so that the next pointer within pack reaches the end of the deck at the beginning of the second hand if this is the case we need to reset the pointer to 0 however we cant access next from euchrecpp and passing in a deck with no cards remaining violates the add rme confirmed by an instructor in a different piazza post is this something that we need to account for and if so where should we reset next
student,in the human player class i have implemented a helper function that prints out the hand i made it a static helper function but because it iterates through my hand vector that i created which isnt static i am getting the error invalid use of member hand in static member function what do i do to get around this thanks
student,in the reset mode after each hand do we simply use the reset function to make next 0 then use the pack with the order changed by last roundlast round the shuffle mode was on or we reread from the file and used the original order wihout shuffling
student,since we never discard the card in the pack does that mean that the pack is empty when the next pointer is at 21 because at that point the deal is done if at that point the pack can still not be considered empty then this pack can never be empty then the empty function does not really do anything
student,do we still not have to test any void functions
student,in the case that a human is a dealer and the upcard was ordered up on the first round of making trump is there a newline after playerwhoorderedup orders up suit eg which of the following is correct hand 3 drew deals nine of diamonds turned up alice orders up diamonds human player drews hand 0 nine of clubs human player drews hand 1 jack of spades human player drews hand 2 jack of clubs human player drews hand 3 queen of hearts human player drews hand 4 queen of clubs hand 3 drew deals nine of diamonds turned up alice orders up diamonds human player drews hand 0 nine of clubs human player drews hand 1 jack of spades human player drews hand 2 jack of clubs human player drews hand 3 queen of hearts human player drews hand 4 queen of clubs
student,in the second round does the dealer still need to pick up the upcard after ordering up or no
student,im a little confused about how to implement pushback popback and index i thought using these functions was the only way to add and remove elements to and from vectors so i dont know how to implement them thanks for the help
student,working on the first function pushback and was having difficulty figuring out how to get this to work i am stuck on how to use a pointer for this to make room for the next element thank you
student,so for human players we are supposed to sort the hand into ascending order should the sorting be done in playercpp or in euchrecpp
student,after running in the terminal my code turned into numbers like 7f45 4c46 0201 0100 0000 0000 0000 0000 0200 3e00 0100 0000 c012 4000 0000 0000 how would i fix it thank you
student,i know this has been discussed throughout piazza but i still dont have a sound answer if the default pack constructor is used then the cards vector should contain no cards therefore it is empty so packempty should be true my question is how would empty test that cards has nothing in it especially since piazza seems to have said next should be initialized to 0 but a 0 next does not indicate emptiness since it just points to the first element in the vector which could have a card in it i thought of initializing it to 24 instead but i saw on a post that an instructor said this is not allowed at the same time empty should also return true if pack is a full 24 cards but all cards have been dealt so essentially there are two possibilities for empty to be true one if all cards have been dealt and one if the card vector is empty
student,hey i was working on packcpp and i started to get this strange memory error any ideas
student,could explain to me what is wrong
student,my iterator says no viable conversion from const pointer to pointer stdvectorcarditerator it playerscardsbegin why thanks
student,are our derived classes suppose to be static
student,i wrote the exact same code as the spec described but the compiler is saying error expected ‘ ’ before ‘ humanplayer ’ any ideas as to whats up thank you
student,do we cout the players actions within our player member functions or within euchrecpp thanks
student,i keep getting a failure on this section of the auto grader but i am not sure why i used valgind and it is coming up clean and i have positive i have the assert statements correct in the file what else could my problem be
student,are we writing 2 derived classes for the player class one for human input and the other for simple which is the strategy outlined in the spec
student,hi in playercpp i created the derived class simple by class simple public player but in the playerfactory function when i say return new simplename just like the rmes said i get an error saying that simple is an abstract class so i cant make an instance of it i have implemented a constructor for my simple class that should make simplename possible so i dont know why im getting this error any help thanks
student,i have read a lot of relevant piazza posts and i learnt that we should not call the function adddiscard inside maketrump but then whats the point of passing in the dealer the strategy we are given only involves us looking at our hand what suit the upward is there must be some purpose as to why the dealer is passed in please explain your answer instead of a couple of short words
student,hi i know we cant make objects of abstract classes but can we make objects of a derived class from the abstract class like in project 4 the abstract class is player and were supposed to make derived classes simple and human can i do this in an int main function simple s1 or is the only way to use pointers thanks
student,does euchre count as an argument ie is the number of arguments 11 or 12
student,can someone summarize the reasons why global variables are a bad idea to use we keep being reminded not to use them but in a lot of other languages all variables are global and in microcontroller programming theyre the only way i know of to share variables between code running on multiple processors im not sure i understand all the disadvantages of using globals in c
student,the specs read during round 1if any player orders up the upcards suit becomes trump and the dealer is given the option to replace one of their cards with the upcard so why is it that in euchretest50out correct after bob orders up hearts the dealer alice isnt given the option to replace the upcard
student,the spec says to print the dealers hand and a discard option if the human player is a dealer how do we check to see if the player is a human
student,what code are we supposed to output if the human selects a card that heshe is not allowed to select does not follow suit are we supposed to account for this or just assume that the human knows the rules and follows them
student,if it is round 2 and the simple player has a jack of spades the upcard was a nine of spades and the player has no other face spades does the player declare clubs as the orderupsuit so is the potential left bower considered thanks
student,in the make trump function of human how can we change the dealers hand if the dealer is inputed into the function as a constant player shouldnt the dealer not be constant so you can change his hand if he decided to discard something
student,according to the project specs if a simple player does not have the led suit in their hand they should play the lowest card in their hand however in the first trick of the first hand in euchretest01outcorrect bob leads spades with diamonds as trump and alice plays the ace of hearts even though she has a lower card in her hand shouldnt she instead play the nine of clubs alices hand is given below alice 0 nine of clubs 1 ace of hearts 2 queen of diamonds 3 king of diamonds 4 jack of diamonds
student,are we allowed to use the vector rotate function in euchrecpp
student,in the first scenario where all players are simple players and the jack of diamonds is turned up based on alices hand wouldnt she pick up the jack of diamonds or is it the case that simple players do not pick up the upcard because is the euchre00out it is evident that alice did not pick up the jack of diamonds
student,so instead of having it where i have the problem of passing in caen but failing the autograder i am getting a 99 on the autograder but failing the diff for euchre test50 i know why it is happening too but if it is passing the autograder should i just leave it
student,i think my partner and i found a bug in euchretest50outcorrect the spec requires two endlines after human player orders up a suit but this creates a difference of 1 line between euchretest50outcorrect and euchretest50out if we eliminate the extra endl to pass the diff check we fail the euchretest50 test could euchretest50out be off by one line please let me know if this issue has already been addressed thanks
student,when i run my sdiff against my output and the correct file the only thing that says differs is that the correct file has the argv commands on the top of it are we supposed to reprint the argv array to make our output match the correct file or is that more of a reference line so we know what needs to be inputted to get the output in the correct file
student,for some reason my sort function is not printing out my elements in order of value despite passing all of my tests what could the potential issue be
student,i keep getting this error when including my player factory file despite not including redundant files in my header playertests passed bash42 make playertests g wall werror pedantic cardcpp playercpp playertestscpp o playertests tmpccnf2azyo in function playerfactorystdstring const stdstring const playertestscpptext0x0 multiple definition of playerfactorystdstring const stdstring const tmpccuhjrtnoplayercpptext0x0 first defined here collect2 error ld returned 1 exit status make playertests error 1 bash42 what could the issue be
student,so i have looked up numerous posts about playerh but i just cant figure out how to store the hand for player i think it has to do with derived classes but i am not sure how that plays a part in the other h files
student,please enter a suit or pass when i try to print this using cout gedit thinks this is two strings and does not include pass how can i get around this
student,is it the trump suit or the suit if not considering the trump suit
student,the specs say if a human player is the dealer and someone orders up during the first round of making print the player’s hand and an option to discard the upcard how do we check whether the player is the dealer i understand that it would be done with an ifstatement but i havent seen the word dealer anywhere in the code thank you
student,i keep getting the euchretest compilation failures and i am not too sure why i am running valgrind clean and i have not included any libraries that were not listed in the spec under the ones that we were allowed to use i am only using the make euchre commands to compile and i have sdiffed my output and could not find anything is there anything else that could possibly be going wrong that i could be checking for i am using putty and i was wondering if my code would run differently if i used the vnclogged onto an actual caen workstation thanks in advance
student,in appendix b it states the specifications of what we should have printed in the end im just confused on if those print statements are supposed to be in humanplayer or euchrecpp since in functions like maketrump it tells us to cout these statements thanks
student,i am pretty much finished with player but it has one problem where i declare the hand in the private member variables to be a vectorcard it says it is an invalid use of the member variable hand what is my problem here
student,say that a player that isnt the dealer chooses to order up in the simple strategy if this happens do we have to replace the lowest card in the dealers hand with the upcard or do we only do this if the current player is the dealer if it is this how can we tell that another player has already ordered up thanks
student,our code is compiling but failing both these validity checks i have gone through each assert and checked if it should actually be true what could be the problem here thanks
student,i am getting this error when i attempt to write the getname function in the simple class can anyone explain what i did wrong
student,i wanted to create a function to access the players hand inside playercpp from euchrecpp however since we cant modify the interface class player since its in the header file i wouldnt know how to access it if i just put this function inside one of my derived classes such as human
student,the compiler isnt recognizing that card is a type when i use it in a vector playercpp in member function ‘int simpleplayernumfacecardsstdstring’ playercpp3223 error ‘simpleplayerthissimpleplayerhand’ does not have class type card card handati heres one of the many errors i get above this code i have vectorcard handmaxhandsize and i get another error that maxhandsize has no type im so confused right now help would be appreciated
student,since we need to print out the dealers hand if the dealer is human and somebody orders up in the 1st round i was wondering how to access his hand i was thinking maybe creating a function inside playercpp to get access to the vector hand inside playercpp is there any other better way
student,there is no constructor definition in playerh so how am i supposed to build a constructor in playercpp it just keeps telling me class not found thanks
student,in the project specs it says that if the simple player does not have the led suit that they should play the lowest card in their hand is this the lowest card in their hand based on operator based on cardlessconst card a const card b const stdstring trump or based on cardlessconst card a const card b const card ledcard const stdstring trump
student,nope no nein dont touch them no matter why you think you might need to you dont why well you edits to the header files would be local were not turning in the header files the autograder has the header files we can download from the project folder so if you made edits the autograder would have no idea in a real world real life senario or if you were working an a personal project or if we were turning in the header files then you could touch them all you wanted or as much as the specinstructions given to you allow tldr dont do the thing
student,for cardless do we check if they are the same card or we assume they are different
student,so in a piazza post someone said not to modify any h files but dont we need to modify playerh with all the override function definitions for simple and human player thanks
student,im not trying to ask a code this for me question but can someone give me a hint to lead me in the right direction for coming up with a way to always know how to deal out the cards in a dealing helper function for the first case where player0 is the dealer we would just deal out 2 to player1 3 to player2 2 to player3 and then 3 to player0 and then 3223 but if player1 is the dealer than wed be dealing to player2 basically im having a hard time coming up with a way to create a helper function that would always pass them out properly given who the dealer is since the order would keep changing any tips would be appreciated thanks
student,in my playertest file i want to make global cards to use in each test the top of my file looks like this include playerh include iostream include string include cassert const card ninescardranknine cardsuitspades const card tenscardrankten cardsuitspades even though my card initializer is just fine the cards never get initialized their rank and suit are and why might this be
student,not sure if this has been asked before in one of the examples in the spec it says print the dealers hand if a player orders up during the first round as well as an option to discard the card is this supposed to be done only when the dealer is a human player or for any time a human player orders up even when the dealer is a simple player secondly are we supposed to be sorting our vector of cards
student,does any card below 9 count i am confused why they arent mentioned in the spec
student,i am getting an error that says playercpp19110 error cannot cast simpleplayer to its private base class player return new simpleplayername i have a constructor for simple player that initializes name i am inheriting the player class for simple player like class simpleplayer player i dont understand what the error is or how to fix it
student,can we use helper functions for the bool operators in card how and where should we implement them
student,i am confused why playerpublictest passes in my terminal but not in the autograder i also went through and made sure that all my h files were not updated any help would be great
student,one thing sort of unclear to me is what these operators account for since the specs say it doesnt account for trump would i still account for the hierachy of suits d c h s within the operator or does the operator only account for the ranks of cards
student,were having a hard time figuring out how to increment through the players in our player array in the game struct throughout the euchre game since its always changing who the dealer is and it cant just be incremented after the dealer since it needs to loop back to 0 players 03 so for example when leading and playing cards we need to tell it who to start as the dealer then go around the other players but were stuck on how to do this any tips thanks
student,we are getting the following error when trying to compile part of our euchreccp file we are trying to implement screw the dealer for a human player type bash42 g pedantic wall werror o1 euchrecpp playercpp packcpp cardcpp o euchre playercpp in member function ‘virtual bool simplemaketrumpconst card const player int stdstring const’ playercpp7734 error no matching function for call to ‘playeraddanddiscardconst card const’ dealeraddanddiscardupcard playercpp7734 note candidate is in file included from playercpp20 playerh3616 note virtual void playeraddanddiscardconst card near match virtual void addanddiscardconst card upcard 0 playerh3616 note no known conversion for implicit ‘this’ parameter from ‘const player’ to ‘player’ we cant quite figure out where this error is coming from or why our player is const thanks
student,how would i go about writing a for loop for an array of players that starts at the person left of the dealer and then goes to the last person to play a trick we have a function called next which returns an int of the index of the next spot in the array ex if we passed in a 3 it would return a 0 we just dont know how to do the condition part of the for loop to hit every player once any insight
student,effects returns the suit hint the left bower is the trump suit stdstring cardgetsuitconst stdstring trump const if the trump suit is hearts and the card we are checking is a jack of diamonds does this function return diamonds or hearts
student,so i was just still confused on what a representation invariant is from what i understand is it like an overall set of rules you need to follow in addition what is an invariant in general since i know in the lecture it said that recursive and iterative were types of invariants as well
student,i am little confused 1 is the led card the first card put out whether it is the trump suit or not 2 is it either the case that the trump suit is the same as the led suit or different 3 does trump suit always beat led suit
student,our code is failing test01 when we run our code through a diff checker it shows no difference we are passing test50 and test00 with no issues but the autograder is saying the output is incorrect for test01
student,is there a memory leak in playerpublictestcpp the notrobot alice and bob pointers are never deleted at the end of the file does the destructor take care of those thanks
student,i am a bit confused as to how to use the sort vector function for leadcard in the human class considering sort deals with ints and each element of my hand vector is a card im sure i could do it without using sort and i dont understand what the benefit of using sort would be
student,i just want to clarify because the wording on this is all confusing we are not dealing with a vector correct we are dealing with an array and implementing functions that we know to be used with vectors so that we have an array that we can almost use like a vector
student,how do we know if the player wants to pass wants to order up etc which parameters correspond to the wishes of the player im very confused
student,i believe this should be stored in the player class but im having trouble figuring out how to its not mentioned in the helper file so im confused as to where it should be and how it should be stored
student,i just want to clarify i only saw one piazza post on this but it was unclear what exactly should we be printing out if we have an error opening a file i saw a piazza post that said we can just print anything sensible but i just wanted to double check also in the spec were told to exitexitfailure we dont actually type exitfailure right we just exit with nonzero
student,i created a struct called game and i have player plays4 inside it to store the players however for player players4 xcode gives the error message array of abstract class type player i believe this error is because it doesnt know if the players are simple or human yet but is there some way to get around this error thanks
student,in the functions like card dealone in pack shouldnt there be a modifies clause because we are changing the next pointer
student,so say bob is a simple player or a human player when he makes trump the function should be returning true but should it also be modifying cout by printing the script bob orders up hearts im just wondering when this script could be printed because i believe if it is done locally in the class functions it would save lines of code in euchrecpp
student,virtual const stdstring getname const 0 so the helper file for player lists the above function i understand that its suppose to return the name im just confused on a few things 1 how can the function name have spaces 2 how do we access the name or better yet where do we get the name
student,when i am testing my code i am getting some incorrect output but i do not understand the logic the spec says the simple strategy for playing cards is if a simple player can follow suit they play the highest card that follows suit otherwise they play the lowest card in their hand the trump suit is diamonds and spades is the suit that is lead since alice whos hand is printed on the right side cannot follow the spades led suit she plays the lowest card in her hand but the output says she is supposed to play the ace of hearts can someone explain to me what i am misunderstanding as i do not know how ace of hearts is the logical card to be played
student,im trying to find the index of an object stored inside a vector like this int index ptr1 ptr2 where ptr1 and ptr2 are pointers to player objects inside a vector however im getting weird values for index if ptr1 and ptr2 were pointers to integers index would be a valid index inside the vector because c knows how big an int is does the above code work with custom objects such as players
student,when returning the play card how am i supposed to remove the card from the hand using popback and then return that card when its no long in the vector i have been looking at this httpstackoverflowcomquestions12600330popbackreturnvalue but in xcode it says that we cannot convert from a void the pop back to a card the play card any help thanks
student,what should the default constructor of card set the rank and suit to
student,so i ran my code on xcode and it works just fine but when i run it on caen i get a sag fault can somebody please help me fix it this is what happened when i used valgrind
student,student simple player tests validity check compilation success return code incorrect score for student simple player tests validity check total 01 what does this error mean does it indicate that there is a possible memory issue i double checked with valgrind thanks
student,i see in the spec what the prompt should look like for a human player to pass or pick a trump suit but its a little unclear whether or not this prompt should be the same when deciding whether to pass or order up during the first round of making trump should we give the same prompt for both rounds and just assume that the player will either pass or enter the suit of the upcard during round one
student,in round 2 the trump changes to the opposite suit how can we take into account for that since if we just get the suit of the upcard it will not actually be the suit we want i apologize if the sentence above is not the most coherent
student,i left my class as simpleplayer player and complier said base class inaccessible which means it is protected or private class by default i remember the lecture slides says it is public by default
student,when handling command line arguments is it acceptable if multiple players are given the same name
student,the spec say that the first side to reach a specified number of points wins what should be done if both sides reach that number at the same time are more rounds played until the tie is broken if not then what message should be printed at the end
student,there was a question about this earlier but the answer was from a student and not seen by an instructor so im still not certain we are a simple player in our hand there is a jack of spades and 4 nonface red cards for simplicity the up card is a spade in round 1 all players pass it is our turn to either pass or select a trump suit in round 2 we are considering making clubs the trump suit however we require that 1 or more face cards of clubs are in our hand technically if we were to select clubs as trump the jack of spades would qualify as a clubs face card in this case would we order up clubs or pass this is for writing rigorous test cases as well as writing the maketrump function itself thank you
student,my player factory function has this error that says allocating an object of abstract class type simpleplayer and it says unimplemented pure virtual function getname in simpleplayer however i did implement getname and every other function whats the problem here
student,for the human class i am working on the maketrump function and have two questions first do we have to keep the parameter const card upcard as an input for the function even though the user chooses whether or not he wants to order up i understand how that parameter would be used for the simple player but not the human player next i am trying to account for this part of the spec in maketrump but having trouble if a human player is the dealer and someone orders up during the first round of making print the player’s hand and an option to discard the upcard then prompt the user to select a card to discard the user will then enter the number corresponding to the card they want to discard or ­1 if they want to discard the upcard do we check if the player is the dealer in maketrump then print the hand in an if statement then print out an option to discard the upcard all in maketrump and then prompt the user to discard a certain card in the human addanddiscard function
student,if a human player is the dealer and someone orders up during the first round of making print the players hand and an option to discard the upcard would it be acceptable to add something like gettype as a private function so we can figure out whether the dealer is human or not or is there a better way to figure that out there must be a better way
student,how do you pass argv2 into pack ours wont compile
student,i want to print the name of current player so i use the function like this cout human player getname but the system report an error what is the correct why to get the players name thanks
student,im using strncmp and strlen for my project the spec says were allowed to include string but when i do this caen tells me strncmp and strlen arent defined in scope if i include stringh it compiles are we allowed to use stringh
student,if i wanted to sort a vector of cards based on ascending order and taking trump into account how would i go about doing that i know i need to use the vector sort function as well as the cardless function but i am confused on how to call the cardless in the sort function because cardless takes in 2 cards as its argument
student,trying to design a helper function that deal the pack a few questions 1 since we dont want to modify the pack itself should we be making a new vector to hold to upcards for the rounds when we are done 2 i understand a dealer will be designated and passed in for round 0 player 0 etc but how can i tell who is to the left of who eg if i want to loop through the players to add something to each persons hand obviously there is counter but i cannot figure how to say deal one iteration x deal to player x
student,since the pack is a vector are we allowed to use the empty function that is in the vector library i feel like im over thinking this
student,is the players hand suppose to be a vector of cards is it suppose to be in the playerh file or am i suppose to declare it inside of playerscpp
student,i know that the specs say dont modify h files but h files are there for declarations so in my playerh is it ok to declare simple and human types there and then write their functions in the cpp file or are we supposed to strictly write the classes in the playercpp file
student,the spec says during round two a simple player will order up the suit with the same color as the upcard if they have one or more face cards of that suit in their hand lets say in the second round of making the simple player possesses a jack of the same suit as the upcard do they consider that to be of the suit with the same color as the upcard more specifically if the upcard is the nine of hearts and the simple player has the jack of hearts do they consider it to be a diamond since if they order up diamonds it would become a diamond
student,we are creating a vector to store the player pointers the vector is of type player and is passed in by reference into two of our helper functions at the moment when we pass in the vector by reference we get the following error invalid initialization of reference of type ‘const stdvectorplayer’ from expression of type ‘stdvectorplayer’ readindataplayers packfilename shuffle points argc argv why does it say that the types do not match
student,hi pretty much every function in card and pack have paremeters passed by reference but we dont really change the parameters so can someone explain why theyre passed by reference thanks
student,
student,in the constructor in the blue slide after slide 24 we initialize eltsize but not the array eltseltscapacity what is the default initialization of elts is it all 0s or something else
student,in my test suite may i make a bunch of global cards so that i dont have to remake them for each test function
student,my cardtests is valgrind clean and all my tests cases pass yet i am failing on the autograder i have read the other posts on this but i just want to clarify at this point should i assume i have an incorrect implementation of a card function somewhere or is there another reason it could be failing the autograder
student,for some reason after copying from the spec wordforword the playerfactory function i get this error playercpp in function ‘ player playerfactoryconst string const string ’ playercpp24914 error expected typespecifier before ‘ simpleplayer ’ return new simpleplayername playercpp24914 error expected ‘ ’ before ‘ simpleplayer ’ playercpp24931 error ‘ simpleplayer ’ was not declared in this scope return new simpleplayername why do i get this error
student,ive read through the previous piazza posts on how to print the players hand and im still confused i have a helper function that helps me print the players hand in my playercpp but i also want to use a similar function to help me in my playertestscpp the problem is in my helper function in player i can access hand directly but i dont believe i can do that in my playertests since hand is a private member variable any ideas onto how i could use a print function to test something like addcard in my test cases
student,suppose lead suit diamonds trump suit hearts player has two cards of led suit jack of diamonds queen of diamonds which one would he play im confused since he has to choose from a non trump and jack in this case is both a trump and a card of the led suit
student,can our derived classes be declared in the playerh files or should it be only in the cpp file
student,for the simple player add and discard method although we want to discard the lowest card including the upcard if the upcard is always going to be trump then why would we ever want to discard it unless we werent considering trump if were considering trump we would not need to consider the upcard
student,i got an error message using valgrind memcheck a memory error detector it doesnt tell me anything else not like other errors on valgrind that give you line numbers or something im trying to google this but does anyone have suggestions on how to find where the problem is using valgrind or something else thanks
student,im trying to make a constructor for a simple player i dont believe player has any constructor i can use to initialize the name right class simple public player public simplestring namein name namein is this how i should be using the simple constructor simple simpleplayername i get an error saying unknown type name simple any ideas
student,im trying to debug euchrecpp in xcode i dont really like xcode but i dont know how to use gdb or any other debugger and i would rather use a gui right now the problem im facing is that xcode always adds an argument for me i know how to add arguments passed into the code edit scheme so i added the necessary arguments for a default game of euchre 12 arguments including the executable euchre and when i run the program arg 13 when it should be 12 thats because xcode is adding an argument for me it looks like its the address of directories on my computer to get to the files that are being included so when i dont add any arguments of my own argc1 and its that directory address anyone have any ideas how i can fix this or what i might be doing wrong thanks
student,how are we supposed to swap the upcard ie make the upcards rank and suit the same as the discard if its passed as a const or are we just constructing the discard to match the upcard
student,for this test i tried dealing every single card and then asserting that after the very last one has been dealt that the pack is empty however it failed thinking that it still isnt empty i assume this has something to do with the pointer but am not sure how to fix it at what point will the pack be empty
student,in the maketrump function in the simple player class does the dealer consider the upcard when deciding whether or not to order up a trump suit that is if the upcard is a face card will that count towards the dealers 2 required face cards to order up that trump suit
student,ive read through the piazza posts about testing pack and i just wanted to clarify some things packtestscpp will be handgraded the autograder will input its own text file to the constructor but for our testing purposes we are allowed to write our own input files in addition to packin if we do write our own input files do we need to do anything with them other than just use them in our test functions
student,if the dealer is a const player how are we gonna add and discard card after deciding the trump if we cant modify it
student,im trying to make the simple class and test it using playerfactory however when i try to compile i get this error error expected initializer before token player playerfactoryconst string name const string strategy what exactly does this error mean andor how can i fix it does it mean that the player class was not definedimplemented yet like do i have to implement a constructor for the player class in playercpp im sure the solution is really simple im probably just thinking about it all wrong
student,so in light of the drop deadline being tomorrow how exactly is this class curved at the end is it possible to receive a cc if my midterm score was about a standard deviation below the median and project scores are average
student,so for sorting the hand for human it appears that in the correct output that despite not taking trump into account it is expected that we take trump into account human player alices hand 0 nine of diamonds human player alices hand 1 ten of diamonds human player alices hand 2 jack of hearts human player alices hand 3 jack of diamonds human player alices hand 4 ace of clubs this was taken directly from the correct output however with ignoring trump the output should look more like this human player alices hand 0 nine of diamonds human player alices hand 1 ten of diamonds human player alices hand 2 jack of diamonds human player alices hand 3 jack of hearts human player alices hand 4 ace of clubs what is the discrepancy
student,hey guys ive been trying to figure out this issue for a while now ive finished coding playercpp it passes the player public test on caen as well as the tests that i wrote for it also i noticed other people were having this issue and they were able to find memory leaks using valgrind but when i use valgrind it is reporting back that there arent any errors i still cant figure out why my playercpp is not passing the public test in the autograder any help would be great thanks

student,so is the reason a game struct is helpful in our project because it can hold variables such as round scoreetc so it doesnt need to be tracked within main i know the spec says it is a protip i just want to make sure i understand why it is useful thanks
student,so ive read through the spec a few times but i just want a confirmation of my logic to see if im right if we were sorting a hand of cards that contained jack of spades jack of clubs queen of spades ace of clubs nine of diamonds would the proper order when the hand is printed be nine of diamonds jack of spades jack of clubs queen of spades ace of clubs thanks
student,just to be sure where i should be putting my cout statements should all the printing done during the game take place in euchrecpp except for when printing the human players hand in the appropriate functions like for example whether a player passes or orders up
student,when we implement the pack constructor should next be index 0 or index 24 it seems like it would make sense either way since which end of the pack is the top is arbitrary
student,when i try to store a card in my struct for euchrecpp with card card it does not work because there is no default constructor for card however when i try to use the constructor like this card cardnine diamonds error expected identifier before string constant card cardnine diamonds euchrecpp1921 error expected or before string constant does anyone know what is the best way to store the card
student,ive copied the output below note that in the third trick alice leads with diamonds and drew plays the jack of hearts but in the next trick drew plays the ten of diamonds meaning that he legally should have played a diamond in the prior trick this even goes against the simple players strategy since a simple player is always supposed to follow suit if heshe can drew should have played the ten of diamonds in the third trick hand 0 alice deals ace of diamonds turned up bob passes cathy passes drew passes alice orders up diamonds ace of spades led by bob nine of hearts played by cathy queen of hearts played by drew ace of hearts played by alice bob takes the trick king of spades led by bob ten of hearts played by cathy king of hearts played by drew queen of diamonds played by alice alice takes the trick jack of diamonds led by alice ten of clubs played by bob queen of clubs played by cathy jack of hearts played by drew alice takes the trick ace of diamonds led by alice jack of clubs played by bob king of clubs played by cathy ten of diamonds played by drew alice takes the trick king of diamonds led by alice queen of spades played by bob ace of clubs played by cathy nine of diamonds played by drew alice takes the trick alice and cathy win the hand alice and cathy have 1 points bob and drew have 0 points
student,the autograder has given me this error three times so far is this happening to anyone else
student,i have tried numerous ways to attempt to print my hand that i build in my playertestscpp file the terminal keeps telling me that class player has no member named hand when i attempt to access it in the following manner call a player factory with a simple player named bob bobhand i pass the playerpublictest and addcard appears to work because the public test passes ive tried various combinations of pointers cards and other variables to sort this out but the underlying outcome is my private member card vector for hand says it does not exist a card vector named hand is initialized in the subclasses any suggestions to why its saying this side question in playerfactory i appropriately call the correct constructors for subclasses which both contain the card vector named hand should terminal be saying class simpleplayer instead of class player since it is the subclass that has this variable if so why is it not registering that the subclass is a simpleplayer
student,how do you call maketrump using the parameter const dealer when the only way to create a new player is to use playerfactory and playerfactory returns a pointer to a player
student,for our code do we need to assert the requires clause from what i can tell in the spec we are able to assume correct inputs throughout the project meaning that asserts would be redundant except for our own testing correct
student,to clarify the human player is guaranteed not to reneg as that would be considered cheating and the spec says human players will not cheat correct
student,what is the parameter after the shuffle option in argv in the outs its a 1 and i dont really know what that means
student,when uploading the cardcpp and cardtestscpp to check on autograder it seems to be giving this message below student cardtests validity check compilation success return code incorrect score for student cardtests validity check total 01 however when i run cardtests it seems to operate normally and successfully returns 0 is auto grader malfunctioning or is there something i am missing
student,are we supposed to reprint the command prompt at the top of the program like the outcorrects have my code should be identical and that line is the only difference on my sdiffs but i am failing the autograder
student,why does alice not pick up the jack of diamonds its the left bower isnt it
student,when the humanplayer is addingdiscarding what shpuld the proper input be should it be 1 or just 1 im just confused about when the humanplayer is playing what corresponds to what theyre entering and what is privded by cout thanks
student,to print the human players hand it seems like we have to iterate over every element of the players hand however this cannot be done inside of a const function how should we go about printing the players hand in such a function
student,for make trump in humanplayer i know in the spec it says we can assume proper input so does that mean that we can assume the player will know that if they are the dealer and its round two then they must pick a trump ie for round 2 do we essentially not have to check if the dealer calls the function because they would enter something other than pass if they are following the rules thanks
student,i want use global variables in my test files in order to have a switch for outputting to the console
student,this above fragment is a screenshot from hand 0 of my euchretest01 in which i printed out the players cards above the move to debug drews move is apparently incorrect and he is supposed to play the jack of hearts however the spec says that a simple player must follow suit with the highest card of the led suit and if the player cannot then play the lowest nonled suit card the next move drew plays the ten of diamonds showing that he did indeed have a diamonds why wouldnt he have played it this move
student,the first 20 minutes of lecture 15 recording of deorio seems to be cut off is it possible to reupload full lecture recording if there is
student,i am getting an error that the dereference operator is not recognized the error is no match for operator operand type is const string aka const stdbasicstringchar any thoughts thanks
student,could we 1 pin a post with a revision log or an exhaustive list of updates to the spec for the project 2 post something to the google drive with an exhaustive list of updates to the spec for the project 3 agree to reserve a tag for piazza posts containing notifications for spec updates 4 not update the spec in the middle of the project 5 not post multiple conflicting versions of the spec in different places in the same course drive 6 issue patches preferably wchecksums with updates as they come in addition to one of 13 and 5 ps the version of the spec in the google drive under projectproject4project4pdf hasnt been modified since oct 27 2015 by james perretta creation date whereas the version of the spec in the google drive under projectproject4pdf was modified nov 2 2015 by alexandra brown
student,ive read all the posts so far on helper functions but i dont understand how to declare a private helper function if we cant edit cardh can anyone help
student,can i assume that the cards in packin will always be given in the same order i want to be sure i can write test cases for that order specifically
student,how do you run a program in xcode with command line arguments
student,im impressed by the debugging ability of xcode so far ive figured out how to make command line arguments in xcode but i have a hard time finding a correct way to pass file input into xcode any ideas
student,having a really hard time starting this i think all my other files work anything in particular i should start with i dont think i know where to start
student,ive been using the makefile to compile and run my pack tests and public tests and they work fine and pass but when i stick them in the autograder they dont compile anybody know why
student,say i type make packtests and i get back packtests is up to date does that mean by packcpp file is working correctly and should work in the autograder
student,in playercpp i get the message overloaded operator must be a binary operator has 3 parameters for my ostream operatorostream os const player p function this isnt a problem in cardcpp so im not sure where the real problem is coming from is there an error somewhere else in the code or what thanks
student,when implementing the pack constructor is there something specific were supposed to name each card or should i be using the new keyword
student,would ranknamesbyweight0 return two
student,just to clarify the rules the project spec says in the case of screw the dealer the dealer will always order up the suit with the same color as the upcard does that mean that the dealer must order up the exact same suit as the upcard or can they order up a suit that is the same color as the upcard if so how do they make that decision
student,can we include cardh and packh in playertestscpp and assume they are correctly implemented
student,im trying to test my euchrecpp in xcode by removing the argc and argv parameters in main and just manually setting the values of argv at the start of main im currently getting an error saying that a conversion from string literal to const char isnt allowed how would i set the values of argv manually without getting an error
student,hello i submitted my files to the autograder and everything other than playerpublictest passed playerpublictest compiles within caen so i tried running it using valgrind valgrind showed a leak but when i changed the code in playerpublictest to contain delete human delete alice delete bob valgrind no longer contained a leak i was wondering if this issue is on my end or if playerpublictest should contain those lines thank you
student,in the player public test file i dont see anywhere where the players are deleted i also caught some memory leaks while using valgrind for this file is this an error in the public tests file or is there somewhere else where were supposed to delete the players
student,im trying to initialize a constructor in the my simple and human class for player for playerfactory because the effects clause says to return new humanname i thought i would have to add a constructor for the players name however this would create another member function which i dont think were supposed to do i cant initialize it in the private because then the data is inaccessible is there a way to initialize this constructor legally
student,when we define the simple and human classes in playercpp do we need to separate the declaration and definition of each function within the class or can we combine them
student,im using the makefile and have not edited packpublictestcpp or any header files any guidance is appreciated
student,for when the human player is making trump the spec says the user will then enter one of the following spades hearts clubs diamonds or pass to either order up the specified suit or pass this procedure is the same for both rounds of making trump lets say that were on the first round of making trump and that the upcard is a 10 of hearts what happens if the user enters clubs to show that they want to order up should we just prewrite an error statement if the input does not correctly match the suit of the upcard am i overthinking this
student,in the case that the trump was made in round one the dealer has the option to not accept the upcard correct if so then what would be the human input the command to express that the dealer would not like to replace any of their cards with the upcard
student,how would you initialize a vector within an initializer list
student,im having an issue where i have two player helper functions that are declared and defined but are not being recognized by the simple and human subclasses structure of code playercpp static helper function declarations class simple public player function that calls the helper class human public player helper function definitions errors in member function virtual void simpleaddanddiscardconst card playercpp10743 error sorthand was not declared in this scope sorthandarguments playercpp at global scope playercpp24713 error void sorthandarguments defined but not used
student,for me personally when i have played euchre if you screw the dealer and force himher to order up and the dealers team only wins 2 tricks then the other team only receives 1 point not 2 are we doing this as well or is it the case that every time the team that orders up doesnt win three tricks the other team gets two points
student,are we allowed to use the break keyword in our code in 183 we were deducted style points but my partner who was 101 said that in his class break was okay to use
student,should we cin the players choice of card to be discarded before the line dicard upcard is printed that seems to be the only way that you can print out the correct number in the brackets despite the player not being told to select a card to discard until after that line is printed
student,in the spec it says to follow suit if they have it and if they dont then they should throw their lowest card but what if they have a trump and could win the trick are we taking this into consideration or is this too advanced for our simple player
student,i looked up a piazza post on this question but i am still confused are we supposed to initialize the constants somehow i understand that when i pass in a string to the constructor it will initialize the trump andor suit to what i pass in so if i read in ace of spades and use that information to initialize a card then the constructor would have string rank ace and string suit spades later on i assume im supposed to use the static constants for comparisons with what i have so ifrank ace but then instead of ace i might just write rankace so now this doesnt make sense to me in two ways we are never told about initializing these values and i cant really believe they are already initialized because just as const int two does not automatically equal to the integer 2 const in banana does not automatically equal to 2 now this makes less sense to me because im now convinced that we arent supposed to use these constants at all someone please help and clarify
student,why do we even consider discarding the upcard in addanddiscard when the suit of upcard is trump by default in the body of this function first of all that means youd almost never have a case where the upcard is the lowest card considering trump second of all in a real euchre game in the extremely rare case that you have an entire hand of the same suit as the upcard even if everything you have is higher than the upcard you still have to discard something from your hand
student,are we allowed to create any structsclasses that we need within euchrecpp
student,if the input file is not able to be opened we are supposed to use exit1 in packcpp however if i do this it says that exit was not declared in the scope how do i fix this
student,hello if i have a function that takes a parameter by reference func int param when i use param in the function will it be a pointer int foo param if i want the value of the parameter i passed in by reference would i write int bar param or does param come to represent the value of the parameter
student,the rme for dealone says that the next card should be returned and the next pointer incremented so if we are at card 23 in the pack should next be reset
student,i know that we need a constructor for the simple class how would we initialize the hand of the player in simple class
student,i keep using the sort function but their continues to be an error stating error passing const card as this argument of cards cardoperator why does this error keep occurring if i am using sort the way it was stated in the spec and i included the algorithm library
student,for the error message for reading in the arguments should we literally print cout usage euchre packfilename shufflenoshuffle pointstowin name1 name2 name3 name4 endl or should be be filing in the variables with the actual inputs that were inputed packin 12 alice simple etc
student,for round one when dealer has to add and discard a card if a player orders up a card do we call addanddiscard inside maketrump can we call it using dealeraddanddiscardupcard
student,so for the first round if a player orders up a suit the dealer will have to add and discard a card from his hand do we implement this in the maketrump function for human where does the implementation for this part come in
student,in human player addanddiscard function the only argument is an upcard should we take that to be the card that the user choses to discard example the function looks like this virtual void humanplayeraddanddiscardconst card upcard should we take the input that the user puts into the upcard argument to be what they want to add or discard very confused about this
student,so i am testing my simple player class and i was wondering how to test the screw the dealer if statement right now i have an if statement stating that if this the address of the dealer do stuff in my simple class should i be making a new object in player tests whose address the address of the dealer im a bit confused as how to do this thanks
student,for add and discard for a simple player would we need to use cardless rather than the operator because the upcard you pass in is now the trump suit this seems to make sense logically but just want to confirm thanks
student,after shuffling this is the order i get qs ks as 9h 10h jh qh kh ah 9c 10c jc qc kc ac 9d 10d jd qd kd ad 9s 10s js im pretty sure i did it right but if so the only actual change versus an untouched deck is that 9s 10s and js move to the back of the deck
student,the project spec states that during round two a simple player will order up if they have one or more face cards of the same color as the upcard in their hand are we to count the left bower of the potentially ordered up suit as a facecard of the same color suit
student,this might just be because i did eecs 183 and we werent allowed to explicitly return true or return false but is it okay in this project
student,if shuffling mode is enabled how do we shuffle for hands 234etc do we just reset the pack and shuffle twice for hand 2 3 times for hand etc
student,will our playercpp be tested using only euchre deckshands or should we plan for the case as in the public tests where a hand in euchre is populated with all 2s
student,when i run the makefile the diff for test50out and test50outcorrect showed that my two files had no difference in output but when i run it in the autograder it says that the outputs are different any suggestions
student,so for bool empty const in packh i have written a function that goes bool packempty const in packcpp but when i try to compile it gives me the error expected initializer before const the code compiles fine if i remove the const in both the header file and the cpp file but wont compile otherwise what could be causing this kind of error
student,should the cardless functions take into account the left and right bower
student,so i understand we cannot simply compare the names of the dealer and the player to see if they are the same person i understand that this function will be called as playermaketrumpetc dealer etc etc my solution to this would be to compare the location of dealer to the location of player my issue is how do i get the location of player i cannot simply compare player and dealer because the name of player will be different every time
student,when writing the constructor for pack how do you assign a vector to be the cards vector should we make it of size 0 or of size 24
student,in lecture we learned about dynamic memory when the program completely finishes does the dynamic memory stuff still exist or is it destroyed if not what happens to those variables
student,in lecture we learned that the static keyword when applied to variables in functions means that all instances of the class share this member variable what if the static keyword is not applied and the class declaration just has something like this without the static keyword class intset public const int eltscapacity 100 wouldnt it be true that all instances of the class have this variable
student,so i ran valgrind and see that i have 30 errors in my project in 30 contexts when its run i do not really understand what the error messages mean am i able to come into office hours to have these explained or is it something were more supposed to try and figure out on our own
student,i am confused what this is checking because i was passing it on the autograder and then now i am not not entirely sure where to start on how to fix this problem
student,we have completed our cardcpp and playercpp but when we try to run playerpublictests we run into issues with our algorithms use of our comparison operators more specifically we have written our and operators to only account for the fact that the cards being compared will be within the scope of playable euchre cards 9 10 j q k a in the playerpublictests it uses the two of spades which would be out of the euchre scope do we need to rewrite our operators to account for all card ranks regardless of if they are practical to be used in this given project
student,i tried creating a vector of shape pointers and then as elements including an ellipse and a circle address i am getting error shape is an inaccessible base of circle i thought circle is a ellipse is a shape
student,i completed the lab and it all works well but i get these warnings using eclipse cdt what do they mean
student,mpccq4ikfzo in function circlecircledouble shapescpptext0x1b7 undefined reference to vtable for circle collect2 error ld returned 1 exit status why would i be getting this error what does this mean
student,i am getting the error redefinition of shapes with a different type shape 2 vs ellipse 1 any idea on how to fix this
student,im trying to implement circlecircle in shapescpp and im getting the error message constructor for circle must explicitly initialize the base class ellipse which does not have a default constructor any idea what this means and how to fix
student,when i try to compile my code i get an error that says there is no matching function call to ellipseellipse radradin for my circle constructor im not sure whats wrong since i copied ellipses constructor for syntax and just changed the stuff that was necessary to make it a circle thanks
student,i think i have a problem with my declaration for rectangle because i get this error when i try to compile error ‘rectangle’ does not name a type rectanglerectangledouble widthin double heightin however i declared it just like the ellipse class was in the header file class rectangle public shape public does anybody know what my problem could be
student,all of my compiler errors are telling me the same thing the error is that xrad and yrad are private in ellipse the first place where this occurs is where i try to implement circle area in the cpp file double circlearea const return pi xrad yrad and then before that i wrote the constructor as circlecircledouble radin ellipseradin radin am i supposed to write it as radin instead of xrad i dont know whats going wrong someone please help
student,my operator function creates this error when i compile cardcpp what does this issue mean cardcpp22054 error u2018bool cardoperatorconst card const cardu2019 must take exactly one argument bool cardoperatorconst card lhs const card rhs
student,in the rme it says that if player wishes to order up a trump suit then return true and change orderupsuit to desired suit if player wishes to pass then do not modify orderupsuit and return false how do we know if a player wishes to order up a trump suit or wishes to pass
student,im not sure what the circle should look like when its printed out
student,when i write the operator function for and in cardcpp the compiler says i cant do lhsrank and lhssuit for accessing the rank and suit for both rhs and lhs card inputs i cant use this since theres two cards why cant use for getting the member variables
student,since the constructor for a pack takes in a filename to read from how are we supposed to use the pack constructor for writing test cases when we cant read from files for sample input
student,i am getting that my area of my circle is zero for lab07 i think it has something to do with my circle area implementation in the circle class which is the exact same as the circle implementation for ellipse any suggestions also in the spec for the lab it says that we shouldnt have to implement any member functions for circle but i couldnt seem to get the right syntax for the functions in circle to make this occur any ideas thanks
student,when i run lab07cpp it prints out the correct shapes but with characters for example the rectangle would be something like this is that what it supposed to print out or there is something wrong in my code
student,i got the redefinition error when implementation rectangle class of lab 7 can anyone know how to fix that error thanks
student,do we take into consideration the players strategy when we are coding playercpp for example when we are addingdiscarding a card or when we are making a trump or we will decide that later when we are coding euchre
student,on page 6 of the spec it says if a simple player can follow suit they play the highest card that follows suit otherwise they play the lowest card in their hand does lowest card account for trump or not for example if spades is trump and the hand is 9 of spades 10 of hearts jack of clubs king of hearts ace of spades would the simple player play the 9 of spades or the 10 of hearts
student,when i run playerpublictest on caen using g it passes but it failed the autograder test i have not changed any h files shouldnt the files be identical
student,should the euchrecpp for human players be created to just read inputs from a file or should we be able to prompt a player in the command line
student,in the specs it says that the suits are ordered as follows dchs however in the code declaration for suitnext it says effects returns the next suit which is the suit of the same color stdstring suitnextconst stdstring suit is the suit of the same color only the next suit in the context of this specific function
student,when i compile my code for cardcpp it gives me these errors cardcpptext0x91e undefined reference to cardsuitspades cardcpptext0x934 undefined reference to cardsuithearts cardcpptext0x949 undefined reference to cardsuitclubs cardcpptext0x95e undefined reference to cardsuitdiamonds cardcpptext0x9a0 undefined reference to cardrankthree cardcpptext0x9b5 undefined reference to cardrankfour cardcpptext0x9ca undefined reference to cardrankfive cardcpptext0x9df undefined reference to cardranksix cardcpptext0x9f4 undefined reference to cardrankseven cardcpptext0xa09 undefined reference to cardrankeight cardcpptext0xa1e undefined reference to cardranknine cardcpptext0xa33 undefined reference to cardrankten cardcpptext0xa48 undefined reference to cardrankjack cardcpptext0xa5d undefined reference to cardrankqueen cardcpptext0xa72 undefined reference to cardrankking cardcpptext0xa87 undefined reference to cardrankace however if i edit the file by removing the card in front of each the error goes away should i do this or is there some other way to fix this issue
student,i cant seem to find if this has been asked but do we need to implement the operator functions listed below the card class declaration in cardh
student,is it bad style if we have a helper function with 9 parameters or more
student,does istrump need to consider the rank to make sure it is one of the 6 euchre ranks for example should the function istrump return true if trump is hearts and your current card is two of hearts
student,are we allowed to add helper functions within the concrete classes of simple and humanplayer and if so do we declare them static
student,because the helper functions are supposed to be private and only be called in the public member functions of human and simple how do we access the private attributes of the players that we create in other words we cant modify player to add getters for the private member variables of the derived classes so how do we access these variables outside of the class without getter functions
student,what should the code do if a human player tries to order up a suit besides the suit of the led card in round 1 of making i was thinking either exit1 or ignore them any thoughts
student,how can we access the next variable if it is private and there are no getnext functions in the h file
student,for the leadcard function in simple player are we supposed to take into account the trump suit when choosing the low card or do we only take the lead suit into account
student,should we write tests for hands that would not be possible in the game of euchre for example would it be valid to test situations in which a player may have duplicates of cards
student,is it possible to make vectorplayer players how will a vector of players work with an abstract data type what about a vectorplayer pointers im getting compiler errors about using in the vector declaration
student,how do we consider playing repeated hands what is the new deck after a hand has finished do we reuse the initial pack
student,for virtual functions why dont we add keyword virtual in front of the function name when we implement them in cpp file
student,in card whenever a function takes in stdstring can we omit the std in the cardcpp file since it uses namespace std
student,when trying to return new simpleplayername pg 11 of spec i am getting this error error 1 error c2061 syntax error identifier simpleplayer any ideas
student,if the trump suit is spades lead card is two of clubs and the simple player has card jack of clubs does the jack of clubs follow suit if the trump suit is spades lead card is jack of clubs what suit is assumed as follow suit spades or clubs
student,so in the first round after the upcard is chosen if a player wants to order up they must have two face cards of the same suit which is the possible trump suit as the upcard right and if no player has this the next possible trump suit becomes the suit of the same color as the upcard and if a player orders up they must have simply one face card euchre is still new to me just want to make sure i am getting this right
student,to access helper member functions that we wrote in the derived classes would we have to use dynamiccast in order to convert the player variables to either humansimple im currently unable to access the derived classes member functions because the type of the players is not one of the derived classes
student,do we shuffle before dealing cards before the first round if shuffle mode is on or do you distribute the cards without shuffling
student,i am trying to implement the function virtual const stdstring getname const 0 in derived class but when i insert it into the derived class i get the error expected member name or after declaration specifiers i guess i am confused on how implementation in derived classes works i read the lecture notes and spec and i thought i was doing it right but obviously not any tips thanks
student,how do we use ranknamesbyweight in the operator functions in cardcpp im currently getting the opposite of what im supposed to be getting in my test cases for less than and greater than and im guessing this has something to do with it
student,im writing an additional cardless function to aid me in writing playcard should i put it in cardcpp with the other cardless functions or in playercpp with playcard
student,it shows on autograder like this but i passed all the tests in cean by using make test can anyone help me playerpublic test compilation failure score for playerpublictest total 01 thanks
student,will the 4 players always be all simple or all human or can there be a mix of both types
student,so i see in the spec what occurs during the first round of maketrump for human but what happens for the second round normally in euchre the second round is when you decide what suit is trump does the second roundscrew the dealer follow the same rules as simple where it is just the color of the lead card so suit next
student,if we want to print a human players hand would we have to make a separate member function to do this and should we print the players hand within the functions like addanddiscard
student,does suitnext just mean return the other suit of the same color eg if the suit is clubs then return spades
student,the spec says that you exit when there arent 11 arguments but there are a total of 12 arguments including the executable name is that a mistake
student,if we dont need a member function or variable from class shapes for a subtype do we need to override it
student,how do i test this without looking at the private member variables
student,are we allowed to create a bunch of different cards at global scope and then use them in testing all of our functions rather than creating a different set of cards in each test function
student,in make trump how do we know when the player is the dealer so we can invoke screw the dealer after round 2 if i understand the function correctly how can we compare the player were calling maketrump on to the const player dealer were passing in
student,in the second round of maketrump do we consider the left bower case for example if the upcard is hearts and we have a jack of diamonds in our hand should this be counted as the next suit or the trump suit also for clarification in round 2 are we only considering the next suit or the trump suit and the next suit
student,how exactly do you remove a card from the hand in adddiscard it was easier since we could just swap the two cards but in leadcard and playcard how would you remove the card without adding one to the hand in this case we cannot use swap the only thing i can think of is the vector member function erase but dont think i should use that for now
student,requires player has at least one card effects leads one card from players hand according to their strategy lead means to play the first card in a trick the card is removed the players hand virtual card leadcardconst stdstring trump requires player has at least one card effects plays one card from players hand according to their strategy the card is removed from the players hand virtual card playcardconst card ledcard const stdstring trump so im confused which one removes the card from the players hand do both of them i thought that leadcard chooses which card the player wants to play and then playcard removes that from the hand and plays it both rmes say that the card is removed
student,my cardcpp passes the public tests
student,1 since we are given the hint of using the sort function in the specs can we include algorithm library which is not included in the specs 2 what is the correct prompt for asking a player to discard a card human player eecs280 please select a card to discard thanks
student,i am failing this test even though i am passing everything else i have compiled using the makefile fine my playertestscpp is valgrind clean my program also passes all the provided makefile tests in the caen environment i have no idea what is going wrong so any help is appreciated
student,since the function is void and we probably shouldnt be able to directly access the players hands outside of the class im confused as to how to test this function with asserts could someone offer any guidance thanks
student,when helper functions are declared within classes we cant make them static without getting an error and i really need my helper functions to be in the class is it fine to not have them be static in order to implement them within the class
student,what is the ampersand for does getname still return a string or does it return a string is that an address
student,just to clarify in the human maketrump function we are doing everything included in the spec for making trump which includes printing a statement asking for a choice of suit or pass and then reading that choice in and doing something according to the decision is that correct
student,error class player has no member named hand i declared hand as a private member variable in both simple and human but i am getting this error help
student,hi i want to know who will be the leader for the next hand is it the one who is in location 0 or the one who have just won last trick in last hand thanks
student,in packpublictestscpp we are given the line of code pack packpackin which calls on packpackconst stdstring packfilename which then opens the file to open the file i used similar implementation as we learned in class but with a different filename string filename hellotxt ifstream fin finopenfilenamecstr if finisopen but i keep getting an error when trying to open packin why wouldnt packin successfully open
student,are the names of the players guaranteed to be unique
student,page 12 of the spec says that we should write a game struct to more easily pass game data between your helper functions is there any particular reason this should be a struct rather than a class i find the instructions especially perplexing since project 4 is so focused on classes as opposed to structs thanks
student,where are the players cards stored
student,are we asking the user to passorder up within the maketrump function in human because otherwise i dont see why wed need a maketrump function for human
student,in the autograder there are return code and output what is the difference between them
student,i dont get what to do with this euchre packin shuffle 10 alice simple bob simple cathy simple drew simple do the arguments go into an array somewhere that we need to access for the pack names etc
student,do we need to add some sort or argv and argc to get the player names from command line in playercpp
student,i tried sortvecbeginvecend where vec is a vector of card but i get a lot of template mismatch can someone tell me how to use sort
student,i have subclasses for the simpleplayer and humanplayer i have successfully implemented a constructor function in the simpleplayer class and the same constructor in the humanplayer is running as an error saying that i am attempting to call the cardcard constructor any ideas how to avoid this problem
student,so it turns out that when an object of a class is a const you cant modify any of the objects private member variables so when for example i was trying to call addanddiscard on the const dealer in maketrump i was getting an error what is a workaround to this so that i can change the dealers hand without getting the error or was the dealer made const so i couldnt add and remove cards from his hand within maketrump
student,hi i have a question about the pack after each hand do we have to reuse the pack if it is in what order will the pack be recollected thank you
student,i can compile playerpublictest just fine and when i run it i pass the test however on the autograder i am getting complilation failure any idea why this might be
student,were given the cardscpp starter where all the ranks are set equal to strings does that mean that if you pass in nine and hearts the card constructor will set suit suithearts rank ranknine or is there a conversion needed within the constructor
student,in playercpp i implemented a new class called simple using the syntax class simple public player public implementation here private implementation here but when i try to run playertests it says unknown type name simple were not supposed to modify the h files so i assume i dont need to add anything there so im wondering what im doing wrong that its not compiling
student,hi if the led card is the left bower does this mean the led suit is the trump suit or the left bowers original suit thanks
student,just for clarification the ace is a face card in euchre
student,i want to create an array or vector of cards i want it to be the same as the cards vector in the pack object i want to do this since we dont have a getter function to get the cards at least i dont think we do based on packh why do i want to do this so i can make a loop in the testing file instead of declaring 24 cards then i can do an assert on each one in the loop is there a better way to go about this and if not can i create a getter function in packh just for the use in the test cases and delete it before i submit to the autograder
student,can we assume when the user is inputting the string for the trump suit that the spelling is correct for example user types hearts v hreats
student,can we assume that the cards that are passed into our functions are unique like there wont be an ace of spades passed when an ace of spades is already in hand
student,are we adding the card to hand and removing lowest valued card in hand within the maketrump function it doesnt say to do so in the rme but the spec says to do the add and discard if the trump suit is ordered up in round 1
student,im confused about when to use the overloaded getsuit function i understand that it will change the suit of the left bower but do we call getsuit with trump everywhere we use it for example in maketrump when we are checking how many cards of the next suit are in the hand do we compare each cards suit with upcards suit without considering trump or do we compare each cards suit with the upcards suit considering trump
student,is it kosher to create a new static const string array sorting cards differently in cardcpp my intent is to use it for checking ranks without considering jacks
student,when i call the addanddiscard function in maketrump to pick up the upcard and remove lowest card i get the error member function addanddiscard not viable this argument has type const simple but function is not marked const after looking up the problem i found that i am supposed to make addanddiscard const but this function obviously changes the member variables so why is it telling me to add the const
student,if we forgot to sign up with a partner by 5pm yesterday are we doomed to do this entire project by ourselves im very concerned that this simple mistake will have an unfortunate impact on what i learn on this project my grade and my general mental healthstress level any opportunities for redemption would be appreciated meirl
student,can we assume that the strategy passed in will always be simple or human
student,im trying to initialize a constructor for the circle function and this is what i started with circlecircledouble xradin xradxradin but it keeps giving me the error error no matching function for call to ellipseellipse xradxradin i tried using ellipse in a bunch of different ways because i heard you may have to reference the parent class but it continues to give me a bunch of random errors could someone please explain how to write a constructor of a derived class correctly thanks
student,im getting an error in playerfactory that says player is an inaccessible base of simple does this mean the function is returning a player instead of the derived simple player regardless what could i be doing wrong i followed the return outlined in the rme of the function
student,so what is the difference between using class and struct other than members of a class are private by default and members of struct are public by default
student,is it recommended that we preform that we preform operations upon the dealer inside the maketrump function i am confused by the fact that the dealer is declared constant and yet is passed in as we cannot preform operations upon it
student,when defining functions for the human player would it be okay to modify the functions to take in a variable decision i believe it would be useful and necessary as the human player functions should be based on player input is this allowed am i wrong
student,what decide the precedence of the humans hand card when printing out i am kind of confused when comparing the correct output
student,in the case of screw the dealer in maketrump we want to modify the dealers hand however the function argument for maketrump has const player dealer meaning we cannot modify the dealers hand this means that we cannot implement screw the dealer in this function where should we implement screw the dealer
student,since our test files will be tested against buggy code for this project is it acceptable to use loops in our test cases to make our tests more thorough
student,should we include print statements such as king of spades played by cathy within our humanplayer function implementations for instance the previous print statement would go in playcard or will those go in euchrecpp
student,i am getting this error for euchrecpp and i am very confused as to where this error is
student,i was just wondering if the card jackspades and if trump is club would output jack of clubs or jack of spades in the ostream operator function thanks in advance
student,can you call one of cards member functions in the definition of another of cards member functions
student,has the autograder for project 4 disappeared for anybody else just wondering if its supposed to be gone or not thanks
student,effects returns true if lhs is lower value than rhs does not consider trump bool operatorconst card lhs const card rhs effects returns true if lhs is higher value than rhs does not consider trump bool operatorconst card lhs const card rhs effects returns true if lhs is same card as rhs does not consider trump bool operatorconst card lhs const card rhs effects returns true if lhs is not the same card as rhs does not consider trump bool operatorconst card lhs const card rhs for these 4 operators do we need to take into account suitnamesbyweight and ranknamesbyweight or just the rank names by weight and not consider the suit
student,if we write classes in our cpp files then is it permissible to include the cpp files in our test files we cant modify h files so i cant think of another way of using our derived classes
student,my partner and i are testing are drawone function and for some reason the next value is equal to 65536 when the constructors are the only other member functions called and we have no idea why our code is doing this when we reset the next value to zero the drawone function works correctly but we obviously cannot reset it to zero everytime so we are stuck on how to solve this
student,effects returns the suit does not consider trump stdstring getsuit const effects returns the suit hint the left bower is the trump suit stdstring getsuitconst stdstring trump const i read through previous posts about getsuit and im still a little confused heres my understanding of the two functions can someone please correct me where im wrong the first getsuit will return the suit of the card in question as in if the card is a queen of hearts the function will return suithearts the second getsuit first needs to check what the trump suit is and then based on that return the proper suit of the left bower as in if the trump suit is hearts we need to check if the card in question is the left bower jack of diamonds and if so we return suithearts otherwise if not what do we do
student,im making a derived class for player using the format class player1 public player in my playertestscpp made instances of this derived class like so player1 playerasteve however i am getting a compiler error player1 was not decared in this scope i am including playerh a custom constructor and private member variables and public member functions my constructor follows the format player1const string in initiate member variable why does the compiler say my derived class is not declared in the scope
student,since the function does not return the discarded card and we can not get access to the hand vector of class player how to test whether the player discards the lowest card correctly help
student,me and my partner forgot to register our group before the deadline is there anyway to register late or will we have to work individually
student,pretty dumb question but is it possible to have less than or more than 4 players in a game
student,do we have to private variables in player for each of our derived classes
student,ive been thinking about the shuffling methodshuffling an actual deck of cards the way the spec describes wouldnt the end result of shuffling in this way just be that the first 3 cards in the deck are placed at the back of the deck
student,so i know were supposed to use cardrankrank and cardsuitsuit in cardcpp but does it matter if we just pass in two or spades into our test function in cardtestscpp like well you guys cut points for this thanks
student,im confused about how to implement dealone so we have to return the next card and since next is the index of the next card that needs to be dealt i thought we would access it by using cardsnext is this completely off ive tried to google the correct way to access elements of a vector but i still cant figure it out any suggestionsgeneral pointers would be greatly appreciated
student,requires round is 1 or 2 modifies orderupsuit effects if player wishes to order up a trump suit then return true and change orderupsuit to desired suit if player wishes to pass then do not modify orderupsuit and return false virtual bool maketrumpconst card upcard const player dealer int round stdstring orderupsuit const can you explain the part where it says that the orderupsuit is changed to the desired suit what exactly is the desired suit is it the lowest card in the dealers hand
student,what is the difference in implementation between simple and human player are all the function such as addanddiscard leadcard etc the same for both
student,when i return the new player object in playerfactory i get the error allocating an object of abstract class type simple isnt player the abstract class and simple and human are the derived classes why does the compiler think simple is an abstract class
student,im confused about the declaration of this function in cardh cardconst stdstring rankin const stdstring suitin is card the name of the function or the type of the function if card is the type i expected something with syntax like card cardfunction list of arguments
student,does left bower contains right bower i mean if we test the right bower card in isleftbower should it return true or false
student,ive seen other posts discuss this same issue 2089 but im still unable to figure it out even after getting the help of multiple staff members whenever i try to compile cardcpp the initialization given in cardcppstarters gives this error cardrankeight referenced from cxxglobalvarinit34 in carde6b168o cardrankqueen referenced from cardisface const in carde6b168o cxxglobalvarinit34 in carde6b168o cardrankseven referenced from cxxglobalvarinit34 in carde6b168o cardrankthree referenced from cxxglobalvarinit34 in carde6b168o cardsuitclubs referenced from cardgetsuitstd1basicstring std1allocator const const in carde6b168o suitnextstd1basicstring std1allocator const in carde6b168o cxxglobalvarinit33 in carde6b168o cardsuithearts referenced from cardgetsuitstd1basicstring std1allocator const const in carde6b168o suitnextstd1basicstring std1allocator const in carde6b168o cxxglobalvarinit33 in carde6b168o cardsuitspades referenced from cardgetsuitstd1basicstring std1allocator const const in carde6b168o suitnextstd1basicstring std1allocator const in carde6b168o cxxglobalvarinit33 in carde6b168o cardsuitdiamonds referenced from cardgetsuitstd1basicstring std1allocator const const in carde6b168o suitnextstd1basicstring std1allocator const in carde6b168o cxxglobalvarinit33 in carde6b168o cardrankace referenced from cardisface const in carde6b168o cxxglobalvarinit34 in carde6b168o cardranksix referenced from cxxglobalvarinit34 in carde6b168o cardrankten referenced from cxxglobalvarinit34 in carde6b168o cardranktwo referenced from cxxglobalvarinit34 in carde6b168o cardrankfive referenced from cxxglobalvarinit34 in carde6b168o cardrankfour referenced from cxxglobalvarinit34 in carde6b168o cardrankjack referenced from cardgetsuitstd1basicstring std1allocator const const in carde6b168o cardisface const in carde6b168o cardisrightbowerstd1basicstring std1allocator const const in carde6b168o cardlesscard const card const std1basicstring std1allocator const in carde6b168o cxxglobalvarinit34 in carde6b168o cardrankking referenced from cardisface const in carde6b168o cxxglobalvarinit34 in carde6b168o cardranknine referenced from cxxglobalvarinit34 in carde6b168o ld symbols not found for architecture x8664 clang error linker command failed with exit code 1 use v to see invocation make cardtests error 1 thanks in advance
student,curious
student,do we need to change the options that are output to human players in the situation of a human player that is a dealer and forced to make trump eg human player bob please enter a suit rather than human player bob please enter a suit or pass
student,im stuck with this problem how do we cout pass with quotation marks in c
student,if the simple player is the dealer do they consider the upcard as a part of the hand for example player dealer hand qdiamonds jclubs 10spades 9diamonds aclubs upcard adiamonds would we return true for maketrump since the dealer would be picking up the upcard
student,ive been using erase to remove cards from the hand vector without an issue why are we not allowed to use it
student,im confused about how to count the bowers when doing maketrump in round 2 for example if the upcard has suit spades and it is round 2 does the player count the jack of spades as a face card of clubs
student,can we use getsuit and cardgetsuit interchangeably both declarations seem to work
student,when a card is played the card element in a vector should be removed correct what function can i use to delete an element in a vector from another post it says we shouldnt use erase
student,when considering the argv values in main one of the values is the number of points to win i read it in as a string is there a simple function i can use to convert it to an int
student,do we have to create a hand vector for player
student,im running cardpublictestcpp with g and cardcpp and cardh and while its compiling i get so many errors i have to controlc out of the errors most of them are error stray 377 in program error null characters ignored werror its so bad that my cardpublictestcpp file gets destroyed and the errors go beyond the lines of code the cpp file had
student,are vector member functions other than pushback strictly off limits for project 4
student,when we are checking if the player is the dealer are we supposed to just check if the player has the same name as the dealer
student,playerfactory either returns a pointer to simple or pointer to human correct what does this line of code meando within the spec return new simpleplayername 1 what is simpleplayer the name of the simple derived class 2 how does this return a player i dont understand the syntax
student,in our nondefault constructor should we still be initializing next to zero when we dont we seg fault because next is just uninitialized memory junk and when we do we compile and run correctly there is just nothing on piazza or in the headers suggesting this other than the default has this behavior and my partner and i think it makes sense
student,slight confusion about the project the requires clause for the card constructor says that the rank must be two three four etc but in the tests cases that we were given it shows that ranktwo was used are we supposed to use two or ranktwo i piazza searched but i was still a little confused
student,if we make our own inherited player classes which file should we make them in
student,i am trying to test my cardcpp file but i get a lot of errors as if the class card has not been implemented but it has been under cardh and i included it in my cardcpp file any ideas of what is wrong
student,some of my tests were failing for the operator so i decided to just assertcardranktwo cardrankfive to see if it was my function of the ranks i am getting that that assert statement is false and does not pass if the ranks are weighted by value should this be a true statement
student,when i try to access the rank variable declared in the header file it give me this error error cannot refer to class template rank without a template argument list what i meant to do people on stackoverflow says that i should not use using namespace
student,am i missing something obvious when i manually check the shuffled card order it behaves like this original nine of spades ten of spades jack of spades queen of spades king of spades ace of spades nine of hearts ten of hearts jack of hearts queen of hearts king of hearts ace of hearts nine of clubs ten of clubs jack of clubs queen of clubs king of clubs ace of clubs nine of diamonds ten of diamonds jack of diamonds queen of diamonds king of diamonds ace of diamonds first swap king of clubs ace of clubs nine of diamonds ten of diamonds jack of diamonds queen of diamonds king of diamonds ace of diamonds nine of spades ten of spades jack of spades queen of spades king of spades ace of spades nine of hearts ten of hearts jack of hearts queen of hearts king of hearts ace of hearts nine of clubs ten of clubs jack of clubs queen of clubs second swap jack of hearts queen of hearts king of hearts ace of hearts nine of clubs ten of clubs jack of clubs queen of clubs king of clubs ace of clubs nine of diamonds ten of diamonds jack of diamonds queen of diamonds king of diamonds ace of diamonds nine of spades ten of spades jack of spades queen of spades king of spades ace of spades nine of hearts ten of hearts third swap nine of spades ten of spades jack of spades queen of spades king of spades ace of spades nine of hearts ten of hearts jack of hearts queen of hearts king of hearts ace of hearts nine of clubs ten of clubs jack of clubs queen of clubs king of clubs ace of clubs nine of diamonds ten of diamonds jack of diamonds queen of diamonds king of diamonds ace of diamonds this is the same as the original deck what am i missing
student,what does themean in virtual player
student,for operator and operator should we be checking the suit to determine whether or not to return truefalse or should we just be using the rank
student,see subject im a bit confused about this also it is defined const
student,deal one should begin at the location specified by next correct and not the first card in the pack
student,in the cardh file we declare constants like this class card public rank and suit names static const stdstring ranktwo and in the cardcpp file using namespace std const string cardranktwo two in this case can someone explain what the role of the namespace is and how these constants work and re related
student,what do we actually do when we use card in this context card twospades cardcardranktwo cardsuitspades how does the compiler know what that constant is when it is not in the file
student,if the five cards in hand are all greater than the upcard will the dealer discard the upcard or discard the lowest of his five in hand and add the upcard
student,in the human player protocol the spec says we have to print the players hand do we implement that in the function maketrump in the playercpp file and also about the user input are we suppose to implement in class human too or in euchrecpp
student,hello for the function addcard im not sure what defines a players hand is it a pack of maxhandsize or less thanks
student,i am getting an error when i run my code for playertests and this is the statement i get back and i am very confused as to what it means anyone know what this means in file included from usrincludec482algorithm620 from playercpp17 usrincludec482bitsstlalgoh in instantiation of u2018void stdinsertionsortrandomaccessiterator randomaccessiterator with randomaccessiterator gnucxxnormaliterator u2019 usrincludec482bitsstlalgoh221162 required from u2018void stdfinalinsertionsortrandomaccessiterator randomaccessiterator with randomaccessiterator gnucxxnormaliterator u2019 usrincludec482bitsstlalgoh545347 required from u2018void stdsortraiter raiter with raiter gnucxxnormaliterator u2019 playercpp23338 required from here usrincludec482bitsstlalgoh214217 error no match for u2018operatoru2019 operand types are u2018const cardu2019 and u2018stditeratortraitsgnucxxnormaliterator valuetype aka cardu2019 first glibcxxmoveval usrincludec482bitsstlalgoh214217 note candidate is in file included from playerh130 from playercpp9 cardh157 note card cardoperatorconst card class card cardh157 note no known conversion for implicit u2018thisu2019 parameter from u2018const cardu2019 to u2018cardu2019
student,for this function should we be checking for all card values or just card values 9ace
student,does it matter which card is discarded the rme just says removes one card
student,under value of cards in the spec sheet there is a small section that says in the simplest case ties are broken by suit dchs this is confusing me along with the section that says there are three separate contexts which depend on whether or not a trump or led suit is present 1 how can a led suit not be present in a trick 2 in a trick shouldnt a trump card if present always beat the led card a card of the same suit as the led card but greater in value than the led card beat the led card and the led card beat everything else thanks
student,when you sort a players hand is it sorted only in the scope of the function that calls it or is the hand still sorted after the function returns
student,i entered the email of the partener wrongly and i was registered as work alone can i change it
student,ive read over all the different posts on the topic some say to initialize it to 0 and others say to initialize it to 23 as that will be what it equals when the deck is dealt out for the latter wont the next variable read 24 when it is dealt out and 23 when there is still one card left anyways from what i gather packempty should be able to figure out if it is initialized or dealt out but if next is initialized to 0 wont packempty also return true if 0 cards have been dealt but the pack is full help
student,when printing a card to the ostream do we include an endl within the function ie do we print this nine of spades cursor here or just nine of spadescursor here
student,i dont understand exactly when a simple player will order up in round 2 is it when he has at least 1 card of the same color as the upcard or when he has at least 1 card strictly of the other suit of the same color
student,hi i was trying to access project 3 in autograder and ctools gradebook to check what tests i failed and file a regrade request if necessary however im unable to access it
student,for card const stdstring rankin const stdstring suitin i get the errors expected unqualifiedid before ‘const’ and expected ‘’ before ‘const’ in the same place in my implementation im confused about class syntax so my guess is the error has something to do with that but im not sure
student,in the spec it writes g ­pedantic ­wall ­werror ­o1 euchrecpp gamecpp playercpp packcpp cardcpp ­o euchre do we actually have gamecpp in this project
student,how come when i used dot notation i get an error how can i call a member function on an object without using dot notation
student,my partner and i have made functions in cardcpp to get the strength of the rank and the suit assigned as integers using the global arrays given to us but after debugging we see that when we go through the array each string in the array is empty any help
student,ive seen several piazza posts on this but havent been able to figure it out can anyone give me a hint
student,for the packconst string packfilename function can we assume that packin will always have the same format will packin always have 24 cards where each card is in the format rank of suit or do we have to assume for example that packin might not have the suit rank or include less than 24 cards thanks
student,is it ok to write helper private member functions for the human and simple player classes
student,hello i copied and pasted the cardcppstarter code into my cardcpp and i get these errors upon compiling thanks
student,my program compiles on my local machine but in the caen environment when i try to use exit1 it says exit was not declared in this scope any help for how to address this would be appreciated
student,when i try to run cardpublictestcpp in xcode i get these linker errors it seems to have something to do with the scope resolution operator but i cant find out how to fix it does anyone have any information on this
student,im having an issue declaring a class object when i use the following code i get an error saying no matching constructor for employee employee employee3 in the employeeemployee function i assign the name to inname gender to ingender etc so im very confused why this isnt working any idea why
student,when i try to compile my lab06cpp i get this error g error ­wall no such file or directory g error ­werror no such file or directory g error ­o1 no such file or directory g error ­pedantic no such file or directory g error lab06cpp no such file or directory g error ­o no such file or directory g error lab06 no such file or directory g fatal error no input files i have finished the lab and copied my files to caen i tried restarting the terminal and refreshing cyberduck i use this to copy files to caen any ideas why im having trouble compiling thanks
student,can you use an initializer list when initializing member variables of a struct or can they only be used for a class constructor
student,for some reason my lab code does not print anything for any of the employees i have created have been debugging but nothing seems to help can anybody help me
student,after dealone is called is the card that was dealt supposed to be deleted from the cards vector
student,which lecture has covered operator overloading the stuff like this found in cardcpp bool operatorconst card lhs const card rhs i am a little confused about how this works
student,i am just wondering if i am on the right track so after the first time you swap the two separate divided packs will the values from 1723 become the values at 07
student,in the spec it has const global variables under the do list but global or static variables under the do not list does this mean we can use global variables they just have to be const or should we not be using global variables
student,now that were a few projects in im wondering what development environments and tools people are finding to be most effective ive been using xcode linked to sublime which uploads to my afsmfile ive had mixed results but the xcode debugger is so nice whats working really well for you
student,i cant figure out why im getting this error cardcpp547 error redefinition of ‘class card’ im using the new cardcppstarter and havent changed the header file the basic structure of my cardcpp is cardcppstarter stuff class from header file copy pasted this seems to be a similar format to trianglecpp am i missing something
student,are there differences in compiling with g3 instead of o1 in terms of actual output results or anything else if it isnt can we set all of the optimization flags in our makefile to maximum debug
student,in deorios lecture slides function implementation in trianglecpp uses triangle before each function but in the complete code provided triangle is not used before each function how does the compiler find the area function within the header file without using triangle to specify that the function is a member of triangle class lecture slides vs file provided double area const double s a b c 2 double area sqrtssasbsc return area overall im confused about when to use the scope resolution operator and how header files interact with cpp files when writing classes
student,is there any reason why the printing would not reflect the changes in rank i am stepping through my code and i see the rank changing in memory but it shows the same rank after printing i am updating in between prints not after both prints
student,in maketrump is there a newline after human player alice please select a card to discard eg supposing alice is the dealer and she wants to discard the upcard which is the correct output of the following human player alice please select a card to discard 1 game output continues on this line or human player alice please select a card to discard 1 game output continues on this line
student,are we supposed to use the functions getrank and getsuit in all of the other function implementations in cardcpp rather than just using the private members rank and suit
student,for clarification to reset the pack means that the pack is restored to the same as in packin also any hint on how to implement this mode
student,when were writing code like if rank cardrankjack is it ok if we just do if rank jack because its shorter or are we not supposed to do that
student,hi do we need to explicitly assert to check to see if the requires clauses for each of the functions in card and others have been met thanks
student,undefined symbols for architecture x8664 cardrankeight referenced from cxxglobalvarinit34 in cardo cardrankqueen referenced from cxxglobalvarinit34 in cardo cardrankseven referenced from cxxglobalvarinit34 in cardo cardrankthree referenced from cxxglobalvarinit34 in cardo cardsuitclubs referenced from cxxglobalvarinit33 in cardo cardsuithearts referenced from cxxglobalvarinit33 in cardo cardsuitspades referenced from cxxglobalvarinit33 in cardo cardsuitdiamonds referenced from cxxglobalvarinit33 in cardo
student,i checked the spec and other answers from piazza and dont understand why we need both cardless functions and im slightly confused about how to write each what are we checking for in each function for instance for the first cardless function are we just checking whether the suit of card a is less than card b assuming card b is trumpor is there more and for the second cardless function are we only checking the led card and trump or should we be checking other attributes such as rank like the first cardless function thank you
student,im new to xcode and i find it annoying that i have to constantly remove cpp files from my project because i have multiple main functions and then add them back when needed is there a way to tell xcode which file with main to compile like you can in visual studio
student,as it is not possible to assert that console output is correct in the case of ostream operator we are not expected to return nonzero for this test case the spec says our test cases must return nonzero if the test case fails is the spec incorrect in this case thank you
student,im confused by how you can implement pushback when you call the init function since it requires a pointer to an employeerecord do i use pushback before i even call the function
student,if we write code like this if rank return true instead of this if rank return true will we lose style points
student,im confused as to how to test the addcard function under playercpp i understand that under playerpublictestcpp we have to call the addcard function for the player object but im unsure how to use assert functionsoutput statements to check if the player has a certain card in their hand
student,hello in order to pushback a card into the cards vector would we need to initialize a cards rank and suit from the file readin subsequently we push that card back into the pack thanks
student,getrank does not pass anything as input therefore how are we supposed to know and access in our code which card object we are getting the rank of
student,so there are like tons of if statements in my card less functions and it just seems wrong are we supposed to use the operators to compare two cards in this
student,hello in the packh header file int is declared to be an index referring to the card being dealt in the other rmes it is mentioned as a pointer does this mean that next is to be declared as an int and as a pointer referring to the cards vector thanks
student,since were splitting the deck into 17 cards and 7 cards will we be guaranteed to have at least 17 cards or will we be guaranteed to have a full deck otherwise would the shuffling algorithm not work
student,
student,the rme said that we need to return the lead card and remove it from simple players hand i tried to use the delete key words to delete the lead card from the vector but the g complier said i cannot delete expression of type valuetype so how can i remove an elementcard type from the vector or should i rearrange those cards and modify the size
student,for example i have initialized both to rank 2 before making changes to rank
student,since there is no requires clause for the shuffle function does this mean that our shuffle function is expected to be able to handle a pack with no cards in it ie a pack that was initialized with the default constructor
student,the requires clause of dealone says that it is required that cards remain in the pack is this something that we should test for in the function and exit nonzero if it does not pass the requires clause or should we assume this will never happen
student,i read posts regarding the cardless function but im still a bit confused on what cardlessconst card a const card b const card ledcard const stdstring trump does i dont quite understand how you take into account the led card when youre just comparing two separate cards a and b wouldnt the values of a and b remain unchanged even after considering the led card any clarification would be greatly appreciated
student,in the cardless function i am trying to write an if statement to check if card b is a right or left bower by calling cardisrightbowersuit of some card but i keep getting the error call to a nonstatic member function without an argument and i dont understand why thanks
student,is this function checking if next is equal to 23 or if the cards vector is empty
student,what is the difference between ranktwo and two and when should you use which const string cardranktwo two
student,when i read in from packin i know it works because i cout the cards every time to make sure and all of the cards are being read in properly but when i attempt to populate the cards vector i get an out of bounds error has anyone else had this problemknow how to address it thanks
student,in the packpublictestcpp we didnt call reset function before shuffle dont we have to reset next then shuffle those cards
student,for the getname function for the player class how can we write a function for the abstract class if there is no private member variable name for player are we supposed to individually implement the function into each of the derived classes or are we supposed to do something else
student,in pack after we check if the file can be opened do we initialize the 24 cards into the vector
student,why are these in the cardh static const stdstring ranktwo static const stdstring rankthree static const stdstring rankfour static const stdstring rankfive static const stdstring ranksix static const stdstring rankseven static const stdstring rankeight static const stdstring ranknine static const stdstring rankten static const stdstring rankjack static const stdstring rankqueen static const stdstring rankking static const stdstring rankace static const stdstring suitspades static const stdstring suithearts static const stdstring suitclubs static const stdstring suitdiamonds in cardpublictestcpp the card constructor takes in cardcardranktwo cardsuitspades however in the requires clause it says in takes in two threespadeshearts what should we expect to be taking in for our card constructor then
student,i know what this function is supposed to doim confused how to use this function how are we supposed to call this function what are the parameters that we add to the function what is stdostream os and what do we put inside this parameter thank you
student,how do we test this constructor since we cannot access the packs member variables also is it okay if my packempty function only says a pack is empty if the pack has been completely dealt out and not if there are no cards in it to start
student,i noticed that the shuffle command for euchretest00 is noshuffle so the first card that turned up should be the first card in packin which is nine of spades however in the correct output the card the turned up is jack of diamonds why is that
student,cardcppstarter includes cards twoeight as well as the cards used for euchre however the project specs told us we dont have to check the card deck does the card starter including strings named for cards that we should never get mean that we do have to check the deck
student,since we arent allowed to edit the h files how do we create helper functions that are within the class of something is that allowed thanks
student,in the spec for lab 06 we are asked why we should pass pointerstostructs to the struct functions is the reason 1 that we dont want to pass potentially large structs by value and 2 that we want to be able to modify the structs with our struct functions if those two reasons tell the whole story then why wouldnt passing the structs by reference to the struct functions work as well
student,while trying to test the bool functions operator and operator i get a compiler error error 1 error c2661 operator no overloaded function takes 0 arguments 7 intellisense no instance of overloaded function operator matches the argument list argument types are double int also in vs the word operator becomes blue as if it is a reserved word i think this may be related as to why i get the above printed messages i was wondering if there was a getaround for this thank you
student,should we consider suits that other than these four although it would make no sense since there is no requires that limits the suits to only spades clubs hearts and diamonds
student,i want to make sure im thinking about the shuffle function the right way the spec says that the procedure of shuffling involves cutting the deck in half then swapping the halves repeating this process 3 times wouldnt this produce the same result as cutting the deck in half and swapping the halves once
student,maybe a stupid question but im wondering since we only use rank from 9 to ace why do we have rank 2 to ace in the class implementation
student,cc1plus all warnings being treated as errors make card error 1 bash42 make card g wall werror pedantic cardcpp o card usrlibgccx8664redhatlinux483lib64crt1o in function start text0x20 undefined reference to main collect2 error ld returned 1 exit status make card error 1 what does this error mean thanks
student,just making sure can we create new member functions to the class card pack player
student,from page 6 paragraph 3 last sentence the dealer then discards the lowest card in their hand counting the upcard for a final total of five cards are we comparing including the trump suit or just general rank
student,if the trump suit is diamonds and the led card is the jack of hearts the left bower does the next player have to play hearts or do they have to play diamonds we think they have to play diamonds because the left bower changes suit but we wanted clarification thanks
student,anyone want to play euchre tonight im playing with some friends at some place to be determined so just let me know
student,we failed all of the schelling tests on the autograder all due to the same reason based on the test case that was pulled up by the ta at office hours a cerr was printed when reading in mode file but when we run our program through caen we dont get the cerr message and the simulation runs completely and correctly which is why we got an 88 on the autograder so we are confused what is happening this was the only issue we had and it was the exact same problem for every schelling test case should we submit a regrade request and if so when is the deadline for that
student,i want to add a function to the simple player class for example one that prints the hand to cout to help me test what am i doing wrong i thought you could do this details i wrote the function in the public part of the simple class virtual void printhand but when i try to use it in playertests by doing player bob playerfactorybob simple bobprinthand the compiler gives me an error saying class player has no member named printhand
student,when opening an input file stream in packcpp i cant get my open function to work i called it as ifstream fin finopenpackfilename but i get the console error packcpp in constructor ‘packpackconst string’ packcpp1624 error no matching function for call to ‘stdbasicifstreamcharopenconst string’ finopenpackfilename however packtests compiles when i convert packfilename to a cstring inside the call to open the spec says to only use cstrings when checking argv so whats going on
student,in the specifications for lab 6 it is stated that we need to implement promote demote and setrecord functions as shown in the picture above the first two are provided in the header and cpp files however setrecord is not should we create this one and if so what is it supposed to do
student,i submitted two regrade requests and only received a response to one of them can we expect to receive a response to all of our regrade requests even if they are denied
student,i dont want to use vnc viewer anymore because it is unreliable and want to use ssh on my mac however gedit doesnt open through this way how do i go about getting gedit through ssh
student,i am confused what the pack constructor with no parameters is doing i understand from the comments given in the h file that we need to create an empty pack but i am not sure what that means exactly i assumed it meant that the deck of cards would be an empty vector but isnt that already the case with the private vector in the pack class
student,how are we expected to test the pack constructor when a filename is passed as a parameter if we cannot create a sample text file within our testing function
student,i dont understand the purpose of this function why do we need a second getsuit and what the the trump input for thanks effects returns the suit hint the left bower is the trump suit stdstring getsuitconst stdstring trump const return other get suit applied to trump
student,i tried to enter in someones name as my partner but the auto grader put that i was working alone is there a way to change this before tuesday so that we are partners
student,for some reason when i change the value of rank in lab 6 employeedemote function the change only applies in that scope and arent reflected outside the function what am i missing void employeechangeval val for private variable int val
student,do we need to implement a comparator to sort the hand given a trump suit the standard sort seems to be only applicable when not considering trump suit
student,since our test cases will be used to check their ability to expose bugs do they need a certain format how will our test cases be assessed
student,can anyone tell me if there should be a txt suffix in the constructor of the pack class it seems that there should not be but i am not sure because the autograder for project3 is using txt even when the project specification implied the other way
student,i think i understand how to code playercpp but just to confirm do we make two classes that are subtypes of player one for human and one for simple in playercpp and then within each of those classes we code all the functions that were defined in the abstract player class
student,if i am for example writing an implementation for the isface function and within the function i wanted to call getsuit what syntax would i use to call getsuit but have it be run against the card that isface is looking at
student,my partner and i are a bit confused about the getsuitstring trump function so when looking at a previous piazza post on the subject it seems that if the trump is equal to one suit then the function should return whatever that suit is so if we call getsuitsuithearts then it should return the suithearts correct or does it return suitdiamonds since diamonds and hearts are both red and the left bower is the suit of the same color i ask this because the former seems to be straightforward but when we tried testing it in the cardpublictests we failed since the assert states that asserttwospadesgetsuitcardsuitclubs cardsuitspades if the trump is already suitclubs then why would we return suitspades
student,in the rmes in packh it says increments the next pointer but next is not a pointer it is just an integer so i am slightly confused thanks for the clarification
student,isnt the right bower the trump suit not the left the left bower is itself counted as a trump card but its suit is not the trump suit also is the string that is passed into this function trump a string that is either hearts clubs spades or diamonds and were supposed to return whichever it is
student,im a little confused about this bit of code from one of the slides from todays lecture int main triangle t345 tprint triangle tptr t tptr print in particular what do these lines do triangle tptr t tptr print thanks
student,so for the and operators we are supposed to consider not only rank but suit too right i was wondering why there is a tie breaker based on the suits where d c h s from my experiences with euchre this isnt the case since were only ever concerned with the trump and led suit thanks
student,do we need to check the requires clauses of cardh within the function using assert statements like project 3 for example for the constructor do we need to check that the input is one or two or three etc using asserts within the body of the constructor
student,how do i syntactically write member functions in the cpp file if card is declared in the h file i keep getting errors requiring me to initialize suit and rank in my cpp also it doesnt recognize the functions that im writing as member functions so when i write const in front of my functions its an error i just really need to know how im supposed to connect the two files i have include cardh already though i must have missed this detail in lecture
student,just wondering why are there ranks 2 through ace in the header file arent we just working with a euchre card deck which would have cards from 9ace
student,for the function my first thought is to make a static print function for an arbitrary card and then call the function in the operator implementation seems too complex for a basic operator implementation
student,i am trying to test my packcpp and i am having trouble actually modifying the pack with the overloaded constructor i have debugged and i found that the values are being correctly handled from the file into the cards vector however when i try to test the pack i find that the vector is now empty any idea what im doing wrong
student,in playercpp are we writing the derived classes human and simple that contain the same functions as the player class and are we also writing the player class again in playercpp
student,i received 08 for the file problem 5c and 28 for 3a i was told at office hours that my general approachesalgorithms were correct but i had too many syntactical errorstypos to receive any credit is it at all worth submitting a regrade request although i realize i made a number of mistakes i wonder if i deserve at least a point or two for having the right general idea using traversal by pointer etc please let me know and thanks
student,in our constructor do we need to initialize or mention packsize in pack it is listed as a static const int with value 24 i have tried putting default in the constructor for the first argument but that throws an expected identifier before default error but when i leave it out i get a very long error about an incorrect number of arguments help
student,i noticed that my partner and i were marked down for not including rmes in our submitted files i was unaware that we had to include them in the cpp files or tests when we wrote the code when do we need to insert rmes and where so we do not make this mistake next time thanks in advance
student,so in the cardh file there are two function as such effects returns true if lhs is higher value than rhs does not consider trump bool operatorconst card lhs const card rhs effects returns true if lhs is same card as rhs does not consider trump bool operatorconst card lhs const card rhs seeing as we do not consider trump what would be the protocol for two cards of the same rank but different suit the rme says returns true if lhs is same card as rhs does that mean if lhs is the six of hearts and rhs is the six of spades that operator would return false or does it refer to the rank of the card because it seems like in it refers to the rank of the card but it doesnt seem to be clear for and i saw question 1977 but i didnt feel like there was a really clear resolution thanks
student,how can i initialize an array in a constructor
student,i am getting an error when i try to initialize pack from file by looping through cards specifically when i try to assign cardsx to a new card based on the read in rank and suit i get what is going wrong
student,im trying to write a helper function in cardcpp but im running into trouble because its not declared in the card class in the h file this means i cant write my function in the card scope i want my helper function to receive a const string but the const strings are only found in the card scope so i cant use them how do i deal with this
student,in the spec it says we should copy the starter code from cardcppstarter into our own cardcpp does that mean it would be okay to simply rename cardcppstarter to cardcpp and turn that in thanks
student,what would be the recommended order for starting p4 last project it was util matrix schelling so i was wondering what it would be this time would it be card pack player euchre
student,static const int packsize 24 effects initializes pack by reading from packfilename if file io fails prints an error message and calls exitexitfailure packconst stdstring packfilename can we assume we will always read exactly 24 cards from file filename
student,in this function here cardconst stdstring rankin const stdstring suitin i was just kind of confused were taking in an address and passing it in and then initializing the rank and suit i guess since most examples in lecture were just doublesints its kind of tripping me up thanks
student,bool cardlessconst card a const card b const card ledcard const stdstring trump why is it const card ledcard kinda does it mean that the suit of the ledcard is led suit or should it be like the trump const stdstring ledsuit
student,hello when i ran 10graphicscpp out of the box i got undefined reference errors as shown below thanks
student,yes no
student,im a bit confused as to how to call ostream operatorostream os const card card how would i initialize the os parameter and return an ostream would you have to initialize an os variable to send the output to another file ie txt file
student,is project 3 out of 48 or 42
student,were we supposed to get the paper copy back for our exam i thought i saw somewhere they could be picked up at some point i have just looked at gradescope so far
student,in out cardcpp functions can we assume there is only one of each card for examplecan we assume there is only one right bower i can code around if there is not but the code will be prettier if there is thanks
student,it says in the spec that we are not to use cstrings so does one open a file with out using cstrings specifically finopenfilenamecstr
student,for getsuitconst stdstring trump what does the string trump look like would it just be a suit like hearts or is it a card so like five of hearts
student,i do not really know how to go about testing the overloaded operators even in a basic sense any insight would help thanks
student,the spec says not to use algorithm yet the spec also suggest the use of stdsort which is a part of the algorithm library i would appreciate some clarification on this
student,does it matter if we include namespace std in the cpp file it makes way more sense for me when writing code to include it but the header file doesnt include it
student,what does it mean to create an empty pack
student,are we supposed to write a test case for this function since we cannot really test it if so can we really assert it thanks
student,what is the sign for in this function in cardcpp static const string suitnamesbyweight cardsuitspades cardsuithearts cardsuitclubs cardsuitdiamonds
student,i am getting an error in visual studio when i try to run my cardtestscpp that says i have an unresolved external symbol then lists all of the ranks and suits out i made sure that i wrote an implementation for each function and that i included the appropriate header files any idea what im missing
student,just to clarify are rmes also needed for our test functions even though it is obvious what their purpose is or can we safely omit rmes for those functions
student,when overloading the operators for the card class do we take into account the suit of the cards ex nine of hearts nine of clubs when taking into account suit this would return true but if it doesnt account for suit it would return false which version is it supposed to use
student,in the spec it says for each of the public functions in you must write and submit test cases and each test must be implemented as its own function so in my test function for the equals operator i make several cards and then have several asserts for different situations same suit diff rank assertkingspades acespades same suit same rank assertacespades acespades different suit different rank assertkingspades acehearts different suit same rank assertacespades acehearts do i have to split this up into four separate functions one for each situation
student,can the suit of the led card change if it is the jack of the same suit as trump so for cardless where we consider the led card should we call getsuittrump in order to make sure that if it is the left bower that its suit changes
student,for our cardless function must we consider cards outside of a euchre deck ranks 2 through 8 it doesnt seem like it would make sense to since they would never be passed into the function but i am just wondering
student,for getsuitconst string trump are we only altering the returned suit if the card is the left bower or are there other cases for when the suit is different
student,to benefit future students would it be possible to release the first style grade before the next project is already finished i made a repeat error in project 3 didnt include rmes for custom functions which could have easily been corrected if i had the project 2 score back beforehand i know the responses will be you should have read the style guidelines and it was mentioned multiple times on piazza however people make mistakes i make mistakes i made a mistake sometimes it takes an outside party to see something you overlooked when reading the guidelines or while seeing thousands of posts on piazza example ever been missing a semicolon and been debugging for hours only to have your friend point it out in a minute i will fix this problem for my future programs and i understand nothing will be done about it however i ask that in the future a project 2 grade would come out before project 4 is released disclaimer i understand that there is a bad studentteacher ratio in this class i know all instructors work very hard and it is a lot of work
student,in project 2 the function treemake was declared two different times with different parameters and did different things depending on whether we passed parameters in would i be correct that was an example of adhoc polymorphism
student,in cardcpp im getting an undefined reference to cardrankjack as well as all the other rank constants the code that i pasted from cardcppstarter is static const string rankjack jack which is declared in cardh and initialized to jack in cardcpp the way im accessing this global variable in cardcpp is string str rankjack how can i use rankjack without getting a compiler error
student,i lost points on the handgrading for project 2 because i was missing rmes was i supposed to literally cp the rmes provided in the header files into the cpp files or was i supposed to write rmes for each helper function either way im kind of disappointed i will lose points on project three as well for this because i did not know we were supposed to do this thanks for clairifying
student,if we go to office hours will we be able to see our breakdown of our full autograder code and what tests we failed its currently not up on the autograder website
student,is there any answer key for exam 1 not sure if i should submit a regrade request without knowing what the answer should be thanks
student,hello in the handgrading score summary i received a 06 for rmes in userdefined functions however my p2cpp functions did contain rmes thanks
student,what does the overloaded getsuit function do and how does it differ from the regular getsuit
student,the following function prototype does not take any inputs so how are we supposed to know what to return the rank of also what does const mean in this situation we are not allowed to change the function prototype effects returns the rank stdstring getrank const
student,in cardh effects returns true if a is lower value than b uses both the trump suit and the suit led to determine order as described in the spec bool cardlessconst card a const card b const card ledcard const stdstring trump i think the bolded part has an error shouldnt it be const stdstring ledsuit or something like that if ledcard is correct then do we only care about its suit disclosure i have no idea how to play euchre
student,why are the get functions in triangleh full functions instead of just prototypes i thought only prototypes go in the header file thanks
student,so i was still kind of confused on what the initializer list actually does is it just used to set variables to zero in the default constructor or thanks
student,i cant seem to find this information in the spec are we supposed to be initializing the name gender age and rank of every employee when we create them if so can we set the values to anything we like thanks
student,is returning 0 ever equivalent to returning a null pointer in a function
student,each subsequent hand the role of dealer moves one player to the left im not too sure what is meant by the sentence does it mean that once the dealer is done dealing five cards for himself the dealer deals five cards to the next person ie person 0 deals for person 1
student,is the trump that is passed into most of the functions in cardcpp a suit or a rank
student,what is the meaning of the graded work is originally returned is that mean today or the day we can see the details of gradinglike which test we fail in autograder
student,ive been playing for 10 years but my partner never has so i need to teach him we are going to be in the bbb lobby around 1695 tomorrow evening after 5pm to find us well both be wearing orange anyone else is more than welcome to join us if you prefer a handson tutorial or just want to play the game
student,q
student,in cardcppstarter it specifies using namespace std but then uses stdstring anyway is there a reason for this isnt it redundant
student,is asserting the requires clause a given going forward or was that something that was only required for most of the functions within project 3 thanks
student,hi are we welcomed to discuss with gsis on our own projects in order to find where the autograder may deduct points
student,why cant the value of argv0 be the address of argv00
student,is the score on ctools the final score for project 3
student,for people including myself who want to get started on project 4 early what would be recommended to start on first ie what lectures need to be covered to complete the entire project etc
student,i noticed theres no single tar file with everything in the project 4 google drive would it be possible to add one because of the way google drive works downloading 17 files individually is kind of a hassle thanks
student,the spec says the project is due monday november 20thdoes this mean monday november 23rd or friday november 20th
student,in the case of using pointers to structs through functions such as double triangleareatriangle t ta or ta what is actually going on here so we have a pointer t that points to the variable a does the program know that this variable is in the triangle struct through the input just curious of what actually happens in the back end of things i guess thanks
student,so i am able to ssh into caen linux environment or whatever using the terminal on my mac but if i try to log in to the caen computers around campus or using the download online for my laptop it just gives me a blank screen with no error message or anything i forget if i should contact its caen hotline or both thank you
student,hi i was wondering how i may go about submitting a regrade for project 2
student,since we cant use char spam3 egg due to missing a space for 0 can we do it like this char spam4 egg
student,sorry if these questions are getting annoying this is for those of us who kept receiving 38 due to discrepancies between caen and autograder probably from issues related to valgrind like with me 1 what exactly does running the toolexpsgcheck flag with valgrind do i did a quick google search but was unable to find anything that made sense to me it seems like it checks for accessing an array out of bounds but wouldnt this result in a segfault or incorrect simulation in the first place i dont understand how my code does this but i expect that is an issue for office hours 2 would the instructors please consider grading our projects on the environment available to us students ie caen to determine if we wrote the actual schelling simulation correctly
student,i submitted a request for an alternate final exam time a while ago but i never received an email or notification back on when that time would be i need to buy plane tickets back for winter break so i really need to know when the alternate exam time would be does anyone know anything about this
student,is there a way to see exactly what is wrong with our code specifically 3a 5 im looking at the gradescope i can see what is right and wrong about my code but not why it does not receive full points and what i would have had to do for it to score better i can read what the correct loop would have done but it seem to me that that is what my code does thanks
student,whats the difference ex triangle class in the compound types lecture vs triangle class in adt lecture is it just that the adt is separated into h cpp and implementation so that what it does is separated from how its done are adts just any type with data abstraction
student,was there no lab this week i usually do them sunday morning but i dont see it on the google drive
student,this is not directly related to 280 but i have installed a librarytesseractocr im trying to use in a program but the compiler in my terminalmac is not linking successfully to the library and citing a 64bit architecture issue error message undefined symbols for architecture x8664 tesseracttessbaseapigetutf8text referenced from i have looked through many forums and the only advice i have found is that i should change the project build settings in xcode to be the c standard library instead of apples llvm does anyone know how to do this or of any other suggestions
student,i still didnt get my exam score i was in the classroom eecs 1008 that didnt get there exams graded should i have gotten my score by now
student,is there a way we can see our graded exams
student,is project 4 going to be euchre or blackjack
student,how exactly should i submit a regrade request for my exam 1 is there a form i have to fill out or someone specific i have to email
student,im looking forward to getting a headstart on the project this weekend when is the spec expected to be released
student,hi so i submitted my code to the autograder about 45 minutes ago and i received 8 out of 8 i then went through and made sure my code was well commented and spent the 5 minutes from 1150 to 1155 trying to submit my newly comment code however i kept getting error messages saying to contact the administrators im guessing it was a volume thing i just want to make sure that even if the submits i tried to make at the end didnt count my 8 of 8 submit will still count and those files will be graded since it was the last submit i made before i received a couple dozen submit errors in a row thank you
student,i made changes i need to resubmit but it wont let me
student,i cant submit giving me an error help
student,it keeps saying error and now im getting a 0
student,doesnt test anything just says contact administrator has compiled in autograder many times before did it crash
student,my project is moments away i just cant complete schellingcpp because my matrixrangeradius does not store any values in dest i try to store values in dest count as i move from neighbor to neighbor but i just cant figure out how to put in and extract characters this storage method seemed fine and worked with tests but i get excbadaccess when i use it it schellingcpp or i think it worked when i had it as destcount initially for tests thank you
student,we have a 38 and we got the right output for some of the command line our output looks identical but we cant get it to match the autograder anyone know of any endl or whitespace that we might be missing for some reason
student,i accidentally put in my partners uniquename and then hit enter instead of putting his email now the autograder doesnt display him as a partner i have emailed the staff a few hours ago is there anything i can do to fix this
student,has anyone else had the problem where your row and column are flipped when calling the random function everything works fine in matrix were just having a problem when we try to set random numbers equal to rows and columns
student,does anyone know why it might be output incorrect in autograder
student,how do you run your project through the command line and add a file to that also
student,just a heads up
student,can someone help me with this error bash42 g matrixcpp utilcpp usrlibgccx8664redhatlinux483lib64crt1o in function start text0x20 undefined reference to main
student,i saw 1890 but there was no answer my code compiles on both caen and visual studio but gives different outputs for the after matrix help
student,ive been running schelling with various different parameters adjusted on the input files and there are combinations of percentx and percento that sum to not quite 1 but very close and make the program enter a pseudoinfinite loop is this behavior we need to account for in our code
student,can someone help me with these linux errors it is under my understanding that dest and destsize doesnt need to be initiallized since it is modified in matrixradius can i ignore this error schellingcpp43827 error ‘destsize’ may be used uninitialized in this function werrormaybeuninitialized schellingcpp56927 error ‘dest’ may be used uninitialized in this function werrormaybeuninitialized 1 dest destsize schellingcpp56927 error ‘destsize’ may be used uninitialized in this function werrormaybeuninitialized schellingcpp70325 error ‘dest’ may be used uninitialized in this function werrormaybeuninitialized 1 dest destsize schellingcpp70325 error ‘destsize’ may be used uninitialized in this function werrormaybeuninitialized
student,when i run schelling i always get a matrix filled in with the same character xxxxx xxxxx xxxxx xxxxx xxxxx my matrixprint function works well i tested it what could be a reason for that
student,im failing compilation for utiltests on the autograder but when i use the utiltests makefile in caen it compiles and runs just fine does this issue have a more likely culprit
student,if percentx 49999 and percenty 49999 all the requires clauses are still satisfied but the matrix will likely have no open spaces for my code this causes segmentation fault which makes sense as it will search until it finds an empty space should we do anything to handle this case if so what
student,hi im running through the utiltestcpp test cases and im having an interesting result from the assert on line 18 when i get the value from genrandint31 and print it the result is 1793167292 which has no zeroes in it but the assert is that a call of eecs280randint2 should return 0 which is impossible because there is a 1 in this number which satisfies the premise of the function that the returned value must be between 0 and x which is 2 in this case help
student,when i do make test i get this error no rule to make target matrixprinttestcpp needed by matrixprinttest stop what does this mean
student,can someone help me with these errors i try to compile all these files and it keeps giving me these errors tmpccfor3u1omatrixcpptext0xb9 first defined here tmpcc0uo52go in function genrandint32 schellingcpptext0x27d multiple definition of genrandint32 tmpccfor3u1omatrixcpptext0x27d first defined here tmpcc0uo52go in function genrandint31 schellingcpptext0x45b multiple definition of genrandint31 tmpccfor3u1omatrixcpptext0x45b first defined here tmpcc0uo52go in function genrandreal1 schellingcpptext0x469 multiple definition of genrandreal1 tmpccfor3u1omatrixcpptext0x469 first defined here tmpcc0uo52go in function genrandreal2 schellingcpptext0x4b7 multiple definition of genrandreal2 tmpccfor3u1omatrixcpptext0x4b7 first defined here tmpcc0uo52go in function genrandreal3 schellingcpptext0x505 multiple definition of genrandreal3 tmpccfor3u1omatrixcpptext0x505 first defined here tmpcc0uo52go in function genrandres53 schellingcpptext0x55f multiple definition of genrandres53 tmpccfor3u1omatrixcpptext0x55f first defined here tmpcclsyz0wo in function initgenrandunsigned long utilcpptext0x0 multiple definition of initgenrandunsigned long tmpccfor3u1omatrixcpptext0x0 first defined here tmpcclsyz0wo in function initbyarrayunsigned long int utilcpptext0xb9 multiple definition of initbyarrayunsigned long int tmpccfor3u1omatrixcpptext0xb9 first defined here tmpcclsyz0wo in function genrandint32 utilcpptext0x27d multiple definition of genrandint32 tmpccfor3u1omatrixcpptext0x27d first defined here tmpcclsyz0wo in function genrandint31 utilcpptext0x45b multiple definition of genrandint31 tmpccfor3u1omatrixcpptext0x45b first defined here tmpcclsyz0wo in function genrandreal1 utilcpptext0x469 multiple definition of genrandreal1 tmpccfor3u1omatrixcpptext0x469 first defined here tmpcclsyz0wo in function genrandreal2 utilcpptext0x4b7 multiple definition of genrandreal2 tmpccfor3u1omatrixcpptext0x4b7 first defined here tmpcclsyz0wo in function genrandreal3 utilcpptext0x505 multiple definition of genrandreal3 tmpccfor3u1omatrixcpptext0x505 first defined here tmpcclsyz0wo in function genrandres53 utilcpptext0x55f multiple definition of genrandres53 tmpccfor3u1omatrixcpptext0x55f first defined here collect2 error ld returned 1 exit status
student,i know that the specs say we must use assert for our tests so is there a way that we can do this for testing matrixprint also if we didnt use searchrandom or searchsimple do we need to test them
student,the following files were discarded due to being unnecessary matrixcpp got this error from the autograder what does it mean
student,how do we include multiple files from the linux command line for example if i wanted to run matrixcpp how would i include the cpp files and header files
student,so in our code we only need 3 iterations to get to a satisfied matrix but fails the autograder we check if the potential spots will satisfy before entering in will we get penalized during grading
student,why this
student,my partner and i finished the project and get it to compile perfectly fine on linuxcaen however when we upload it onto the autograder it keeps saying compilation failure whats going on
student,in the spec it says test the following conditions exit with nonzero status if any fail does using assert accomplish this
student,i resubmitted to the autograder left the page and came back when i came back my first submission was still there but the second submission was not has anyone else had this problem
student,when i have the code while fin input being read in from file do something my loop only runs once and then exits is there anything that i might be doing wrong
student,the legal values of satisfaction ration is between 01 isnt it
student,our matrix tests are not passing the autograder test when running valgrind we get the following output valgrind reports that 10004 bytes allocated but states that all heap blocks were freed …are the 10004 bytes separate from the freed blocks is this the expected output from valgrind or is it evidence of a memory allocationrelated bug that might be the cause of our ag failure matrixtests passed 36328 36328 heap summary 36328 in use at exit 0 bytes in 0 blocks 36328 total heap usage 2 allocs 2 frees 10004 bytes allocated 36328 36328 all heap blocks were freed no leaks are possible 36328 36328 for counts of detected and suppressed errors rerun with v 36328 use trackoriginsyes to see where uninitialised values come from 36328 error summary 2 errors from 2 contexts suppressed 2 from 2 bash42
student,im using valgrind and i get a few errors but none of my errors are showing line numbers 44763 conditional jump or move depends on uninitialised values 44763 at 0x4c2c88b strcat in usrlib64valgrindvgpreloadmemcheckamd64linuxso is there a way i can enable line numbers to find out where my errors are because i have no idea where the errors coming from
student,should these functions return a row numbered first indexed at 0 or 1
student,are we expected to handle bad matrix input in file mode strcmp and converting c strings to strings required const char and array in the matrix struct is not declared const
student,my code runs fine when not on caen but there is a segmentation fault when i try and run it on caen any suggestions
student,will we have to worry about checking something that was supposed to be a number such as satisfation ratio being a string if so how would we check something like this
student,when comparing the output file and the correct file i am getting no discrepencies however when i submit to the autograder i get no credit what could potential issues be
student,i followed the exact format specified in lecture for opening files and i know that the filename is correct because i added the cout statement however the files wont open and i dont know how to handle this issue please help like i said im following exactly what was in lecture slides so i dont think posting this code is a violation of piazza rules
student,were we supposed to check that the value passed in for things like satisfactionratio and size are doubles and ints all i checked for is that these values are within the specified range and if we were how would we go about doing so i tried using a pointer to the string before converting to intdouble but that does not work
student,if anyone could shed light on what this means it would be very helpful i really dont understand any of what its telling me 40370 conditional jump or move depends on uninitialised values 40370 at 0x4c2c88b strcat in usrlib64valgrindvgpreloadmemcheckamd64linuxso 40370 by 0x403047 matrixrangeradiusmatrix const int int int char int in homesaatassieecs280project3schelling 40370 by 0x400f4f main in homesaatassieecs280project3schelling 40370 40370 invalid write of size 4 40370 at 0x40317c matrixrangeradiusmatrix const int int int char int in homesaatassieecs280project3schelling 40370 by 0x400f4f main in homesaatassieecs280project3schelling 40370 address 0x0 is not stackd mallocd or recently freed 40370 40370 40370 process terminating with default action of signal 11 sigsegv 40370 access not within mapped region at address 0x0 40370 at 0x40317c matrixrangeradiusmatrix const int int int char int in homesaatassieecs280project3schelling 40370 by 0x400f4f main in homesaatassieecs280project3schelling 40370 if you believe this happened as a result of a stack 40370 overflow in your programs main thread unlikely but 40370 possible you can try to increase the size of the 40370 main thread stack using the mainstacksize flag 40370 the main thread stack size used in this run was 8388608 40370 40370 heap summary 40370 in use at exit 0 bytes in 0 blocks 40370 total heap usage 0 allocs 0 frees 0 bytes allocated 40370 40370 all heap blocks were freed no leaks are possible 40370 40370 for counts of detected and suppressed errors rerun with v 40370 use trackoriginsyes to see where uninitialised values come from 40370 error summary 7 errors from 2 contexts suppressed 2 from 2
student,this might be a dumb question cause it answers it in the specs but i am still a little confused can you use c strings for setting the mode ie string mode random
student,i am getting the same exact random ints for both random mode and for the default why is that the case
student,my instructor prof deorio said program should crash when the input file is in incorrect order but my program can get correct input when two lines are switched eg mode line and size line do i need to revise my code to make sure it crash when the order is incorrect
student,i am using assertptr to make sure ptr points to a nonnull matrix but since we are checking the matrix ptr points to can we use assertptr
student,hello is the utiltests the same thing as utiltestscpp on xcode and the caen linux terminal my code compiles and passes the test however the autograder says it wont compile what could be a possible reason thanks
student,my matrixtest compiles on my linux and it passes all my tests but when i submit to autograder it fails is this compilation check anything other that checking to see if my code compiles
student,there are huge differences in compilation between g and xcode in xcode my matrixrangeradius works perfectly while in g it only ends up saving the first value of the range into the string any idea what differences between compilers could be causing this
student,when i call matrixrangeradius more than once the string is never updated from the previous time i called it it just returns a blank string sometimes other times it crashes my program is there some way im supposed to manually reset the location of the pointer dest passed into the function i didnt think i would have to do this because the pointer is passed by value
student,my program outputs a correct matrix according to the schelling specifications however the matrix that it outputs are not the same as the test input any idea of why how this could happen my only theory is that since the numbers are pseudo random i did something weird or inefficient with them
student,how do i debug my program with arguments passed to main in xcode
student,what is excbadinstruction when i try to check if all spots are satisfied in a function the function works when debugging until it tries to return and then it says excbadinstruction and aborts
student,assuming varname mode mode2 and word are strings is the expression fin varname mode cout mode endl fin varname mode2 cout mode2 endl the same thing as whilefin varname word cout word endl thanks
student,can someone please help with 1800
student,should our random matrix be exactly the same as the one in the specs i think i saw this on piazza but cant find the post my random matrix the specs random matrix any idea of what the problem might be much appreciated
student,currently our code will create a grid with the default configuration parameters would it be better to exit non zero
student,do we have unlimited autograder submits for project 3
student,what exactly are we looking for with the errors are we looking for if the word is spelled incorrectly if the word is missing if we want an int and get a string or something like that can an instructor or someone clarify exactly when we should exit i assumed that we would have to exit if for example mode was spelled moed but a previous answer from an instructor said that misspelling key words isnt something we need to be checking
student,im using my own input file testin mode random satisfactionratio 10 size 10 x 5 percentx 04 percento 04 when i run this file i get funny results 1 i am reading some agents as blank characters 2 i end up generating rows outside of the boundaries 10 16 etc 3 this leads to failing the assertion assertrow 0 row num rows i dont understand this my code works for default tests and im not attempting to generate anything greater or equal to 10 anyone have an idea whats going on tried this input
student,do we have to account for a situation where the inputs to the command line involve the operator to send the output to a file because i think this would change the value of argc
student,when i compile my matrixcpp file in linux i am getting an undefined reference error i am typing make matrix
student,my partner and i took time to format our files nicely in gedit however after submitting this final code the formatting got messed up under the file submitted selection of the autograder specifically some indents are now off from where they should be will we be penalized for style because of this
student,so for my utiltests everything passed ok but now when i try matrixtests i get a weird error everything was working until i got to matrixsearchrandom but now it says tmpccu3oboio in function initgenrandunsigned long utilcpptext0x0 multiple definition of initgenrandunsigned long tmpccpu8tg9omatrixcpptext0x0 first defined here tmpccu3oboio in function initbyarrayunsigned long int utilcpptext0x49 multiple definition of initbyarrayunsigned long int tmpccpu8tg9omatrixcpptext0x49 first defined here tmpccu3oboio in function genrandint32 utilcpptext0x154 multiple definition of genrandint32 tmpccpu8tg9omatrixcpptext0x154 first defined here tmpccu3oboio in function genrandint31 utilcpptext0x2ad multiple definition of genrandint31 tmpccpu8tg9omatrixcpptext0x2ad first defined here tmpccu3oboio in function genrandreal1 utilcpptext0x2b6 multiple definition of genrandreal1 tmpccpu8tg9omatrixcpptext0x2b6 first defined here tmpccu3oboio in function genrandreal2 utilcpptext0x2e5 multiple definition of genrandreal2 tmpccpu8tg9omatrixcpptext0x2e5 first defined here tmpccu3oboio in function genrandreal3 utilcpptext0x314 multiple definition of genrandreal3 tmpccpu8tg9omatrixcpptext0x314 first defined here tmpccu3oboio in function genrandres53 utilcpptext0x34b multiple definition of genrandres53 tmpccpu8tg9omatrixcpptext0x34b first defined here tmpccu3oboio in function setdebugmodebool utilcpptext0x381 multiple definition of setdebugmodebool tmpccpu8tg9omatrixcpptext0x381 first defined here tmpccu3oboio in function getdebugmode utilcpptext0x389 multiple definition of getdebugmode tmpccpu8tg9omatrixcpptext0x389 first defined here tmpccu3oboio in function eecs280randintint utilcpptext0x391 multiple definition of eecs280randintint tmpccpu8tg9omatrixcpptext0x391 first defined here tmpccu3oboio in function eecs280randprobability utilcpptext0x3df multiple definition of eecs280randprobability tmpccpu8tg9omatrixcpptext0x3df first defined here collect2 error ld returned 1 exit status
student,for some reason im having a lot of difficulty replacing the selected agent with a space i am able to move the unsatisfied agent to a randomly selected empty space with no problems but then when i try to replace it with a space it deletes the agents neighbor to the right and offsets the entire row in the matrix so they dont line up in a grid anymore im trying to do this using strcpyptr to agents old location can anyone think of what might be the issue or point me in the right direction for this
student,ive read and reread the spec especially by default the simulator will generate a 5x5 grid populated with 40 x’s 40 o’s and 20 empty spaces agents are satisfied when the number of neighbors like them including the agent itself is greater than or equal to 05 alternatively you can provide an input file to customize these parameters but im still confused on how exactly the matrix is populated are we supposed to write a function in schellingcpp to create this 5 x 5 matrix for us and if so when we use these probabilities 04 04 02 isnt it possible well get a matrix filled with all xs or os or s i guess im just confused as to where these values fit into our creation of our random matrix
student,i checked the previous answers but they didnt use the libraries that we are what function should we use and will we need to include another library thanks
student,hi im trying to assign a pointer to my matrix variable and test my functions however no matter how i edit my program rearranging my matrix im still getting an abort test 6 error or sigabrt how do i begin to debug this ive attempted compiling through xcode to trace the error and get different results every time
student,my partner and my code performs an extra check that after an unsatisfied element is moved that it is satisfied at its new location and if it is not it is immediately moved again this check is not performed by whoever wrote the program that produced the correct outputs it appears that the original program only checks if its completed otherwise keeps producing random locations to be tested our resulting matrices are all fully satisfied and for all our test cases so far the program required fewer iterations iterations meaning moved elements sometimes the resulting matrix will be different but satisfied because of this the resulting out files are not the same as the outcorrect files and were failing all tests on the autograder besides the matrixcpp matrixtestscpp and utilcpp tests what should we do removing our extra check produced an extremely large number of iterations for the program to finish although it still does
student,to round the probability numbers should we be using the precision function in schellling or is it okay to use it in util inside the random probability function
student,do we have to check for the bounds of satisfactionratio they should be 01 but the spec doesnt specify if we should check
student,do we have to write an rme for the int main function of schellingcpp if so how do we go about explaining all of its effects
student,so now this is the only diff result that i am getting when i diff my default debug output with the correct default debug output we are still receiving incorrect output for this test on the autograder our default without the debug option worked correctly and received full credit what could be going on
student,my random schelling process produces the following matrix in only 4 iterations o x o x x x x x x o o x but the correct one which takes 8 iterations is x x x x x x x o xooo my question is just why isnt the first one correct given a satisfactionrate of 05 the two os and an x that move seem to be in their respective majorities before they move thanks in advance for the help
student,do we need to check if the input file contains letters where numbers should be for example in satisfaction ratio if the number following it was a letter insted of a double atof whould return 0 which is technically a valid input making this very difficult to check for
student,is the char we are supposed to return in the matrixsearchsimple function supposed to be a pointer to an array of chars or a cstring example ive found a match at the space indicated by rowcol do i want to initialize it 1 char matchlocation row col or 2 char matchlocation5 row col
student,in one of my functions i am iterating through a const matrixs array with a const char however the function must return a regular char how do i convert the const char to char or have the char point to the same place as the const
student,im stuck between getting two error messages depending on whether i include utilh in my matrixcpp file for the last two functions or
student,we finished project 3 last week but today when we are double checking on the project3 specs we found out that there are some changes and the error unrecognized mode disappeared do we need to keep cerr filename error unrecognized mode in our schellingcpp and are there any more changes thanks
student,what is the value of argc and argv if i am entering schelling filein currently i am outputting argc and getting it equal to 1 and when i print argv it only contains schelling is this correct do i have to check for the filename another way
student,in our function matrixrangeradius we are asked to take inputs including pointers to an array dest and to a variable for the size of the array destsize however as it says in effects destsize is set to the size of dest be it 1 4 6 9 16 whatever can we assume that the original value of destsize is the size of the array dest at the start if not isnt it impossible to check the requires clause because we cannot otherwise find the size of dest based only on a pointer to the first element
student,for schellingdefaultstestdebugoutcorrect i believe the matrix should look like this before the third move happens x x o x x x x x o x o o then it checks 24 which would be a ratio of 1o2x5 so it is satisfied and shouldnt be moved from the specs agents are satisfied when the number of neighbors like them including the agent itself is greater than or equal to 05
student,we cannot assume that the satisfaction ratio inputed from file will be within the range of a ratio 01 correct we have to check the satisfaction ratio
student,whats the difference between return code and output on the autograder my code has the correct return code but incorrect output despite diff showing that my output and the correct output are the same
student,the specs dont say to do that but i was going to include this anyways to avoid infinite loops with input higher than 1 for satisfactionratio any thoughts
student,i just wanted to clarify which test cases i have to actually make from posts here i have gathered that i need in my matrixtestscpp test cases for all the matrixcpp functions but i dont need to include any tests for utilcpp is that correct and do i need to make my own schellingcpp test cases
student,does creating our own struct violate the restrictions on this project for example if i were to create a struct to store all of the configuration settings and pass them between functions would that be fair game
student,when i execute the following code i get the error invalid conversion from ‘ int ’ to ‘ int ’ int destsize 9 matrixrangeradiusm r c 1 dest destsize void matrixrangeradius int destsize the trouble is destsize isnt a pointer to a pointer to int int and the destination in matrixcpp isnt an int so the error message doesnt make sense what am i missing
student,im curious where in the project radius is supposed to be configurable i wrote the function to take any radius size but it doesnt seem like theres a place to change the radius dependent on input so i feel like im missing something
student,what does exit nonzero on error mean doesnt cerr exit the program anyway when would something different be needed
student,matrixpublictestcpp error has a matrix p of size 1 then matrixrangeradius is called on p but with buffer size 0 which would fail if we assert destination size ins matrixrangeradius because buffer must of size right
student,hey so when you read in the percent x and percent y values i saw on another post that we should use the function atof to convert the string to a double however on cpluspluscom it says that for atof if no valid conversion could be performed the function returns zero 00 according to the spec percent x and percent y are both inclusive of 0 so how are we supposed to know if the input from the file is 0 or no valid conversion could be performed thanks
student,i am getting one extra 3 in my random integer calls instead of 331 as the first three random ints i am getting 333 i am also using only two calls to the random int function
student,if the pointer is pointing to something in the first row will this function return 0
student,how can we find either an x or an o when looking for an unsatisfied agent without something counterintuitive in the random search function ie a char input of b would prompt an if statement for x or o since it only takes in one character
student,for the testdriverfilemodein there is a row in the matrix that is blank i tried using getline for this but it does not continue to the next row how do we go about using getline to get this blank row and then continuing to the next is there a newline character at the beginning of the blank row
student,is it possible that someone says size 4 x 4 but passes in a 5 x 5 matrix
student,the rme clause says that numrowsin and col must both be above 0 but less than the maxnumberrows which is 10 for our program right shouldnt it be less than or equal to the maxnumberrows
student,are the default and random mode outputs supposed to be exactly the same can we use the same code for both
student,when running my test cases for matrixsearchrandom im getting a really strange error that im having trouble pinpointing for a particular matrix which has been initialized manually to include x o and if i call matrixsearchrandom to search for an x in the matrix everything works as expected however if i follow that with a call to matrixsearchrandom trying to find an o the output stops before either of the statements execute forcing me to ctrlc out of the program if anyone has any ideas please let me know
student,for the file mode how are we suppose to input that matrix into ours i know i can print out that matrix by using getline but im able to add the content to our matrix
student,i ran my code through the autograder and it compiled and passed everything except the defaults debugger test i ran the code on my computer and then compared it to the correct output i couldnt find any differences so i wrote a program to scan through both my output and the correct output and print if any of the lines were different and that didnt find anything either i already specifically checked to make sure the one number was rounded to 0975 instead of 0098 any idea why it would do this is there a new line space or something that my code would create that isnt in the autograder
student,so it looks like the output is almost correct except for the random fuzzy box at the end which ends up causing the failed assertion the weird this is this does not happen with another one of our test cases any ideas as to what could be happening
student,how do i go about declaring row and col vars to hold the random rows and cols outside of my loop in which i am calling the random int function my loop contains a function that has row and col as parameters so i need to initialize them but if i do i cannot truly get random numbers
student,are we actually calling eecs280randint 4 times 2 to find an unsatisfied agent and then 2 more to find a random empty cell i understand that a function we wrote helps us find a random cell but it doesnt seem like that is what the correct output is doing
student,so i think our way of checking if all agents are satisfied is extremely inefficient so were getting super long run time and i know were only supposed to get like 8 iterations we would really appreciate some insight on how to increase efficiency because weve been stuck going in circles all night thanks
student,hi i just ran utilcpp on the autograder and it said compilation failure however when i run make tests on my computer everything runs fine are there any common reasons why this may be so
student,because we call the eecs280randint and eecs280randprobability functions once each does that mean we can initialize int row and int col to 0 outside of the loop before assigning random numbers to them
student,do we need to write unit tests for the helper functions we created outside of in schelling
student,while a file is open is it still possible to cout to the main file youre in not the open file
student,hello can we assume that when reading the input file tags such as mode satisfaction ratio etc will always be present and spelled correctly example do we have to account for this type of input file mode file size 5 x 5 etc this file would be missing the satisfaction ratio tag completely also if the mode is random can we assume that well be given the percentx and percento tags even if we arent given valid values
student,when i use while getlinefin line then loop through each character of the line the problem is that the whitecaps are double counted how do i fix this
student,what is the six character course entry code for gradescope
student,we just got this error after trying to run schelling with no file inputs and are slightly confused any help would be appreciated thanks screenshot20151023at31119ampng
student,how do we initialize dest given that we do not know the dest size
student,why does c require a after definitions of primitives objects and structs but after function definitions is an extension in many compilers
student,hi when i try to run matrixtests my terminal freezes and all i can do is enter down and do nothing else does anyone have any idea whats going on thanks
student,im not entirely sure whats going on but whenever i try to print my matrix strange characters show up instead of x o and the shape is correct 5x5 but the characters are strange to say the least anyone know what might be going on thanks
student,will the test file actually be graded for its contents for the matrix range function since weve called it a certain amount of time in schelling i think its good enough to assume it is correct so can we not write test cases for it
student,does anyone have any tips on trying to track the moving agent i am using a temp variable to do try and swap the pointers but after it moves once it doesnt track it anymore
student,the rme for matrixnumrows and columns state that the address of locationptr is within the matrix does this mean within the 10000 element array initialized when created or the rxc matrix we are simulating with size rc
student,i know there is a few posts regarding this but i am still confused for the main loop in schelling after we find a non satisfied position randomly do we randomly find an empty space within the radius of that position and then randomly move that position to that random empty space
student,do we have to use every function in matrixcpp could i generate a random agent within schelling instead of using the random search function in matrixcpp is this okay style
student,i believe i heard that d can be placed before or after the input file name correct what should schelling do if argc 3 but the d flag is not found do we attempt to read a file
student,hi do the graders use the original exam paper to grade or use the scanned copy to grade i used pencil in the exam and am worried the answers were not scanned clearly
student,im trying to use strcmp to see if an element in ptr array is x but i keep getting an error saying i cant convert char to char i initially tried for char i ptr array i ptr array matrixsizeptr i where i is x but strcmpi x isnt returning 0 and then i tried char x x with strcmpix which still didnt work any ideas on how i should be using strcmp to see if two characters are equal i know strcmp takes pointers to two chars but no matter what i tried nothing seemed to work
student,for problem 1d i wrote my answer in front of the 1d instead of circling all the option i thought to be right unfortunately the scanning was incomplete part of the a could be seen do you still have the original paper version to verify my answer is actually right
student,my partner and i are getting the right output for the defaults but for some reason it is exiting the loop after only one iteration and we cannot figure out what is wrong we have already checked our debug output and how we read in the filename and they work we dont know where to go next
student,in the rme for this function it says prints debug eecs280randintx numbern to stdout in debug mode should it print literally that or should it print whatever int is passed as the argument for x
student,after the last cout with total number of iterations should we cout endl the autograder says i have an output mismatch and that is the only thing i think it could be
student,it sounds like matrixtestscpp that was in the google drive was changed such that testminimumsizematrix now calls matrixinit with 1s rather than 0s what other project 3 files were updated if any and how important are these updates i have been working off of the files i downloaded originally and dont know what i need to change in the files that i am using so that they are current
student,sorry for the stupid question but i just wanted to double check an agent is unsatisfied if the ratio is strictly less than the satisfaction ratio correct so if the agent has a neighborhood of 4 and 2 unlike neighbors it would be satisfied
student,so we have the proper steps to move an agent when it is not satisfied and we have a while statement to keep moving it until it is moved but once the element moves how do we know where it goes and to then call the move function with this new location sorry if that was confusing my brain is melting at this point and i am willing to clarify further
student,hey so when we are testing this function can we assume the dest array of characters is the same size as destsize will be ive figured out how to store all appropriate values in dest and how to set destsize to the appropriate number ex when radius 1 and the center value is in the top left corner we have destsize 4 and 4 characters listed in dest im wondering what to do with the left over junk in the array when i print dest cout dest endl i get my expected values followed by gibberish namely xxxx277377 is this acceptable i dont know if were supposed to try to resize dest or if the parameter will already have the appropriate string size
student,do we need to write rme clauses for functions created in schellingcpp
student,when comparing my schellingdefaultstestsout with schellingdefaultstestsoutcorrect with sdiff and when comparing my schellingdefaultstestdebugout with schellingdefaultstestdebugoutcorrect with sdiff the terminal outputs the contents of both files to say that they are not equal but does not have any to show where the differences are in the two files i have tried looking for whitespace and any other differences and cant find any are there any other ways to see why diff says the files are different
student,should we check for schelling d schelling d or both
student,can we assume schelling will always be invoked correctly meaning it will always be invoked in one of the four ways mentioned in the spec 1 schelling 2 schelling filenamein 2 schelling d 3 schelling ­d filenamein or do we have to add additional error checking for this
student,for this project are we really only allowed to read in string variables from the input files in other words we cant read in ints and doubles from the matrix file for size and satisfaction ratios respectively the instructors answer to this post 1154 is implying that we can only read in string variables from matrix even though it does not mention this anywhere in the project spec not to mention it wouldnt make sense to do that when we could just read in the needed values as their respective types
student,we think that the random function in util is pretty much a table thats seeded at some point and that the instructors code produced the correct output because of the number of times the eecs280randprobability function was called what we dont know is if our output has to match the instructor output perfectly due to the nature of the condition for our while loop we do a lot more iterations than the correct code no matter what matrix we throw at it we get proper output but we dont get your correct output is that okay or do we need to change our approach do we need to change the number of times we call eecs280randprobability thanks
student,when we run schelling on caen we dont get any output i heard that the output is going into a different file but how do we access that file
student,im having a really consistent problem with initializing pointers in schellingcpp it seems to be mostly associated with null pointers whenever i initialize a pointer to null in schellingcpp eg char i null subsequent calls to the pointer in matrixcpp yield an error in xcode the error is excbadaccess any insight into this im kinda freaking out and i feel like i dont understand something fundamental about the way pointers are supposed to be declaredhow they work
student,when we are checking for errors when reading from the file can we assume that the values are always going to be numbers or do we have to check for if the values are letters also do we have to check for if a value just is not there in the file
student,the requires clause of most of the functions in matrixcpp says that ptr must point to a nonnull matrix but it says nothing about whether the matrix itself has to be initialized do we need to test the case in which ptr points to a valid uninitialized matrix or is testing that a bad idea because that will cause the program to crash when it attempts to access uninitialized values in the matrix struct
student,can we assume that entire lines like mode random and satisfactionratio 05 will not be missing from the file that we are reading in because otherwise that would screw up how i am reading in from the file and outputting the appropriate error message
student,our feedback from the public test cases on the autograder says our return code is correct but our output is wrong what does this mean about our code im confused how its possible our return code is correct but output is wrong
student,throughout this project is it big x and big o or small x and small o im asking because in matrixpublictest its testing for a small x when in the project specs it looks like a big x
student,i know the requirements for an agent to be satisfied but since were randomly checking agents how do we know when to stop looking for unsatisfied agents aka every agent is satisfied can someone point me in the right direction
student,the correct output is rounded to 3 decimals but the probabilities go to 6 decimal places we could use round but is in cmath a library we cant use
student,when we are checking for errors when reading in a file for reading in something like satisfaction ratio how do we check that satisfaction ratio was read in correctly
student,when we try to make schelling in terminal we keep getting errors saying that we have undefined references to functions we made sure all the necessary include are in our files could it be a problem with scope
student,does calling eecs280randint too many times in the driver fail lead to the wrong results i use it once each for row and col outside of the loop to get the first random cell and then while it isnt a certain char use it again twice inside the while loop
student,when we run our output into a out file and diff check it to the outcorrect file the terminal is not throwing any differences however when we submit to the autograder we keep failing output test cases what could be the issue
student,the project spec says an agent is satisfied if certain percentage of its neighbors are alike does this include the neighbor himself ie would the total number of people for the ratio be 8 or 9
student,looking at all the project 3 files in my folder i noticed that there wasnt a debug output file if the program had a random mode if mode is random is it possible to be in debug mode as well
student,up to a certain point were getting the correct random numbers but then they diverge why might this be
student,it looks like we have to use matrixat with randomint for the number of rows and columns from the file im confused about how to call matrixat specifically the first parameter since its a pointer i already made an array and read in the grid of chars to this array any help would be appreciated
student,when i try to compile schelling on caen i get this message for all the matrix and randint functions undefined reference to matrixatmatrix int int i have matrixh included in schelling and i have matrixh uploaded to my caen account any ideas what is causing this error
student,in my schellingcpp i get the file name and open the file and to test i just call whilegetlinefilein string then print out each string when i run this in the terminal am i calling this wrong in the terminal g pedantic wall werror o1 matrixcpp utilcpp schellingcpp o testdriverrandommodein testdriverfilemodein it prints out a crazy amount of symbols and random words not at all in the testdriverrandommodein file
student,i am very behind in the project and i have a feeling i wont finish in time do you have any advice to get as many points as possible with unfinished code
student,still a little confused as to what the error messages in scheilling are supposed to be checking for can somebody please help with that
student,for schelling when we read input from files will we be given files that contain characters other than x o or the space character as in do we need to check to ensure that its an x o or space before we proceed
student,i want to use the format whilecin word to store the satisfaction ratio but at the same time i need to use the format whilegetlinefin line to read in the matrix any advice on how to use both
student,this is our output for the default case satisfactionratio 05 size 5 x 5 percentx 04 percento 04 before x x x o x x o x x o x o after x x x x x x x o x o o o all agents were satisfied after 8 iterations i dont see anything wrong with it but the autograder says incorrect output whats the issue
student,is there a way to do this without initializing the filename inside of an ifstatement or to do it while inside of one i guess which is what ive been trying to do i just get constant compiler errors and i dont know how to solve this if i declare it outside of one of the if statements the code wouldnt run properly if i dont then it doesnt compile
student,do we have to account for when the satisfaction ratio is 0 and if it is zero would we have to move the agent to a position where none of its neighbors are like itself
student,i noticed in the spec that it says we should output an error if the number of rows or columns is below 1 or exceeds 10 but in matrixh the maxnumrows and maxnumcolumns are 100 should we check if it exceeds 10 or 100
student,when creating a random matrix if my percentx is 05 and my percento is 499999 or some other combination of probabilities that add up to just under 1 a matrix is created that has no spaces the spec does not address this it just says that percentx percento must be explicitly under 1 at office hours i was told that we dont have to address this case because the spec does not say that such a matrix should exit but i wanted clarification on that thanks
student,i keep getting this error that says may be used uninitialized in this function even though the variable is initialized within the scope
student,is it an issue to do something like this b a a
student,should we make it so matrixprint has an endl at the end of it
student,i cant figure out how to create a cstring that will have all the necessary characters in matrixrangeradius im iterating through my matrix using a pointer ill call i and im reaching every necessary character but i dont know how to add these characters to the cstring that dest points to i cant use strcat to attach only the first character that i points to because strcat only accepts i as an argument versus i so my question is how do i build the necessary cstring without strcat guidance would be much appreciated
student,is the file matrixtests supposed to compile straight out of the box when i tried submitting to the autograder to see if my other files ran it told me that matrixtests had failed to compile i havent touched anything in it should i try redownloading the file
student,i have included matrixh in the matrixpublictestcpp but i keep getting an error of undefined reference to the matrixh functions when compiling does anyone have an idea why thats happening
student,i know that the matrix will print a ton of symbols if theres no character in the array or blank spaces not sure if i implemented the function correctly i want to make sure that matrixprint is actually printing something and to do this i would need to assign the array a character im having a hard time figuring out how to do this ive tried assigning characters directly into the array and using pointer but im coming up short please help
student,i am having trouble with getlineinfile line it is not reading in anything to the string line i am initializing infile to be string file new stringinput input is a char array ifstream infile infileopenfile it has no problem reading in the modes but then get line does not read in anything
student,i googled how to do this online but i cant seem to cout a double to 3 decimal places without using another library
student,in the helper file above matrixsearchrandom it says call eecs280randint exactly twice first for row second for col do not generate any more random numbers than needed to complete search does this mean that we can literally only use this randint function twice in our code or does it mean that we cant check the same index of the array more than once at first i wanted to pick a random space using the randint once for row and once for column and then just iterate through the rest but i cant tell from the helper file if this method is indeed considered random enough i dont know how to check a random index every time without the possibility of using randint more than once or checking the same index more than once by accident in summary are we allowed to just pick a random space and then iterate normally similar to searchsimple throughout the rest of the matrix or is this not considered random enough and if it isnt then are we allowed to write the randomint function more than twice in our code thanks
student,ive posted a lot on this and ive searched a lot on this and im still super confused i just dont seem to understand the differences between initializing a cstring and an array of characters something else im now confused on is if char dest is how you initialize a cstring just looking at lecture slides then how do you differentiate that from initializing a pointer to an array of characters
student,for errors were told that the row and column values cant be greater than 10 which means that the size cant be greater than 100 elements in matrixh were told the max for rows and columns is 100 each which is the maximum im wondering so i know how big i need to make my arrays in schelling when initializing
student,the error i get is an invalid conversion from const char to char any ideas for what i could be doing wrong this is where im trying to use getline to initialize a matrix the error occurs in char cstr strcstr this is what i found in lecture 8 slides for converting a string to a cstring but it isnt working
student,i am trying to cin the values of my matrix which includes whitespace however whitespace is skipped over when using the cin operator is there any alternative way to make sure the whitespace is accounted for
student,my output and the output of the correct matrix are exactly the same but when i run diff it seems to be finding that my matrix and the correct matrix are different even though they arent why is this the case i counted the spaces and everything thanks
student,just to clarify if the command line does not read mode or nothing is after mode cerr error reading mode if the command line read mode other than file or random cerr unrecognized mode if the satisfaction ratio sizes are out of range cerr error reading ratiosizes point out if im wrong
student,so if i had a matrix of x x x x and i ran the function matrixrangeradiusp 0 0 1 buffer buffersize would the buffersize be 4 and the buffer0 be x also how does the buffer index does it start at the top row go across and then go to the next row
student,what does the and mean in the effects clause does it include zero and exclude x or is it the other way around thanks
student,what does it mean to exit nonzero on error
student,i dont know how to run my code in linux i did make schelling but then when i try schelling schelling d etc nothing happens what am i missing
student,how do i pass command line arguments to the gdb debugger or specifically how do i run the gdb debugger in file mode i want to pass in testdriverfilemodein as an argument to the executable but running this line in bash results in the following error gdb schelling testdriverfilemodein testdriverfilemodein is not a core dump file format not recognized
student,if i want to check if a certain element if an array is a certain character would i use character and not character
student,dest is an array of characters array in the matrix struct is a cstring this is correct yes
student,is it safe to assume that we dont have to check for unsolvable inputs for example the grid is full but only one grid slot is an o
student,so i understand that we will have to parse through argv to find the filename ie parsing through schelling d filename however i am having compiler issues how would i get to the point where i can parse through this right now i am have compiler errors because i first have to run the line g wall werror pedantic o1 schellingcpp o schelling i am having trouble getting past this
student,i understand that the matrix is constant and that the array is not that i have to get a pointer to the first index of the array and then increment that pointer but for the life of me i cant figure out the syntax on how to do this
student,the matrix that is created if the mode is random does not match the correct output given there are more os and more xs there is no given debug out correct for a random mode so we cannot check if the probabilities dont match have already checked our random probability function works
student,im having trouble figuring out how to get the first value that a pointer to an array points to i know that char str hello char ptr str cout ptr prints hello cout ptr prints h what i want is to use a pointer in strcat to build a cstring through iteration however if i had another string and pointer char str2 hola char ptr2 str2 strcatstr ptr2 this yields hellohola but i want it to yield helloh my issue is str2 is inaccessible except via ptr2 so i cant just use str20 ive googled it and searched piazza and cant seem to find the answer please help
student,im using whilegetlinefin line to get each line from the input file grid but when i cout line endl i am getting extra blank lines in my output this is messing with how i set my matrix
student,how do we convert the satisfaction ratio gotten from the file into a double
student,1 1 1 1 for a matrix like this does the rowcolumn start from 1 or 0 like this is 1row and 2 row or 0 row and 1 row
student,if i have a non const matrix that is pointed to by ptr could i pass ptr into an input argument like const matrix ptr if not im not sure what to do anymore because in schelling we need the matrix to be non constant so that we can change it but we also need to use functions like matrixrangeradius to do schelling like does it work that the function treats it as const so the void function wouldnt be able to change it but schelling would be able to
student,if i write a helper function in schellingcpp in which file should i test it
student,since matrix search random returns a pointer to a random character do we need to test this function
student,first question if there is an error when a row or column number is above 10 then why are we even bothering with an assert statement in matrixcpp for if the row or column numbers are above 100 second question do we just do something like exit 1 or do we have to also print some kind of error message out for these three cases in which the numbers are no good but they are present
student,should our test cases for matrixtests be declared static i know helper function in other files must be
student,
student,in my schellingcpp im writing some functions that will be modifiying variables initialized in main should i pass those variables into my function using pass by reference or pass by pointer
student,for this function do we need to return an address or the character contained in that address
student,if i do something like char array20 will this give me an array of characters or will it give me a cstring
student,so when were using the cerr error messages in the project spec what kinds of errors is it accounting for 1 if fin word error checking to see if file read was successful or 2 if word whatitshouldbe checking to see if the words match or both
student,i tried submitting my code to the autograder and its telling me that all the tests for schelling arent compiling when i compile on my own computer g wall werror pedantic o1 matrixcpp utilcpp schellingcpp o schelling it compiles and i can run schelling i havent put in any checks for incorrect file io yet but i wanted to test to see if it compiled should i add in all the file io checks and try again i thought they wouldnt be an issue for compiling
student,i recently updated my compiler and now every time i try and compile i receive this error ld cant write output file schelling for architecture x8664 clang error linker command failed with exit code 1 use v to see invocation i cant find anything about this online does anyone know what to do
student,and im including include cassert how can i fix this
student,my tests dont compile because they dont have a return so im assuming if i want return the assert they would
student,so i think i need the filename of the input file for the ifstream how can i access that
student,so i used get line to read the matrix from the file however how would i store all these different lines into one array
student,i tried to use fstream filein and use getlinefilein str but str is always empty i must forgot to do something anybody have idea what the problem might be
student,our random probability output gives 6 decimal places for example when in debug mode it will output 0957167 when the correct output is 0957 should we limit the number of decimal places so the outputs will match exactly
student,when i run schelling and write it to an output file my resultant matrix is segregated but not in the same way that the correct output files matrix is there is also a difference in the number of iterations mine gives 44 the correct one is 8 however i get the same number of iterations same probabilities etc each time i run the function are the eecs280 functions not truly random if not is there a correct number of iterations for running schelling do i need to check that an agent will be satisfied in its new location before placing it there so as to reduce the number of total iterations
student,im looking at the announcement on error messages are we supposed to print certain error messages if the numbers we read in arent good also why do we have to check for error i thought those were all things we were already checking for assert statements
student,is it okay if we use a more consistent statement to determine if there are any unsatisfied agents at all and then just trust that if we loop through the random number generator it will eventually come to one of those numbers or i guess characters in this case
student,
student,in the projects we are allowed to use a list of libraries and encouraged to use include to add them to our files would it be bad style if i included every library in every file even if the file might not use the library
student,for this function i understand that we use argv to check if d is in argv and we are suppose to set the global variable for set debug mode to false or true that affects whether we get extra output or not while calling eecs280rand my question is are we expected to change the command line which seems extremely wrong to include d if it doesnt already but they call setdebugmodetrue or are we simply just going to include that extra output when they set debug mode to true regardless of if they put d in the command line so does that mean that including that d is actually arbitrary
student,since it generates a row and column randomly what can i do to create unit tests for this function
student,does anyone know why when i run my program through visual studio when reading from testdriverrandommodein file it creates the matrix 25 x x x o x x o x x o x o but when i run it using g i get 25 p e r c e n t x 0 4 p e r c e n t o 0 4 thanks
student,for each iteration in the main loop after i find an unsatisfied agent and an empty agent what does update debug output mean do i just swap whats in the unsatisfied agent and the empty agent and see if thats satisfied
student,im looking on stackoverflow and some of this stuff seems a bit foreign to me how exactly would i use fstream to get a whole line as the first input for getline the examples i see look something like inputgetline a number im assuming i couldnt use getlineinput stuff string right
student,in debug mode the given files show that the debug output only outputs till the last move is done my code however needs to check after every move to see if there are unsatisfied agents remaining as a result even after the last move has been done my code checks to see if all the agents are satisfiedwhich results in extra debug output anyway to fix this i mean i cant see how it is possible to know if all agents are satisfied without checking but that generates more debug output one solution i can come up with is to store all cout output in an array and output it at the very end but that would require me to modify utilcppwhich would go against the requirements for utilcpp help please ideas
student,i keep either getting an infinite loop or getting the incorrect number of iterations im not really sure where im going wrong with calling eecs280randint i am calling the function for row and column to find an unsatisfied agent then calling the function until i find a row and column for an empty space then i am moving the agents using matrixat and setting the old position of the agent to be a space this always gets me an infinite loop any guesses on what the issue is
student,will we have to check if the initial grid given is unsatisfiable for example if there was a 5x5 grid with 23 xs and 1 o with a satisfaction ratio of 5 the o will never be satisfied should we be checking for that or can we assume there will be some number of iterations that will eventually satisfy every agent in the grid
student,hello i am running a while loop that calls eecs280randint somevar the loop runs and works like 3 times in a row at no point do i ever change somevar however that fourth time i always get a floating point exception what is making this error happen
student,for the file mode if the file is mode file size 5 x 5 x x x x x x the satisfaction ratio is missing i asked a gsi he told me that i can do iffin str str for reading data in this situationthere is an error however since something is read this is true so no error would be reported what should we do str would be 5 instead of a satisfaction ratio and 5 is also a numberhow do we deal with this case
student,running schelling with debug mode our random probabilities are all different than the correct output in our function in util we call the function that was given to us as instructed in the rme so why would we be getting such different numbers
student,since schellingcpp has random generators will our output always match that of the correct files
student,when reading a grid from a file how do you account for spaces
student,im very confused as to how to test these functions how can we check a setter without using the getter and vice versa how can i check if the getter is working if the setter is failing how can i test random and probability function if they are random and i wouldnt be able to predict them
student,am i allowed to make void functions just for the sake of not repeating the same lines more times than i need to in schelling that is
student,when were creating a random matrix isnt there a small chance that there would never be an empty space within the neighborhood for people to move to if so do we need some sort of check that the neighborhood has an empty space to move people around and quit if there is not such space or am i just overthinking it
student,how do we convert the cstring at argv2 when the debugger is activated to a string so it can be used as a filename thank for the help
student,we are trying to return a pointer to a char we believe this code would work but dont fully understand struct and how an array works within the struct ptrarrayx
student,in schellingcpp i have an error every time i try to cout something i get an error that cout is ambiguous anyone know what that means seems pretty ambiguous to me
student,i am doing the following const int size matrixsizegridptr agent xyzsize but i am getting the error that the array xyz cannot be of variable lengthbut size is const so i dont see what the problem is i even did this but no solution const int size const int matrixsizegridptr agent xyzsize can anyone help
student,it sounds from posts such as 1176 that unsatisfied agents should be moved to a random empty spot my questions is about that spot to which agents should be moved should it be any random empty spot as opposed to a random empty spot in which the agent would be satisfied that is will agents often move to spots in which theyre actually less satisfied various posts have emphasized the need to maintain the simulations integrity but its hard to see how having agents move to random empty spots in which theyre actually less satisfied is a realistic simulation anyway the implausibility of it is making me secondguess my interpretation of other posts about this issue just looking for some confirmation
student,how do we read in a matrix with white spaces because whenever we cin we skip the empty spaces
student,my compiler does not recognize genrandint31 is there a library im supposed to include or an object im supposed to make i cant entirely check if my program is doing the right thing is the random seed is different than is expected
student,if i do something like if ifstream stuff then will stuff still be read in regardless of if the statement is true or false
student,im getting this error with helper functions in matrixcpp i did this about a million times for p2 so im 100 sure im doing it right and im definitely not modifying the h file in any way is there any reason it would be different this time around
student,to be specific should the program determine whether the mode is recognizable before or after reading in the satisfaction ratio
student,the rme for eecs280randint says prints debug eecs280randintx numbern to stdout in debug mode does this simply mean we cout debug eecs280randintx numbern literally using number or should we instead put the random number thats generated
student,am i correct in assuming that the greatest argc will ever be for schelling is 3
student,if we determine that the matrix is not satisfied and then pick a random location in the matrix which is satisfied do we count that as an iteration or do we only count ones that take an unsatisfied location and move it
student,i think it may be the editor or something weird going on with my compiler but if there is any reason you can think of that including the header file with all of the function prototypes doesnt seem to be enough to use the functions including the actual cpp file works fine also the ide i am using currently is codeblocks
student,note this question is asking how c works and it is not directly related to the project lets say i have some function and in that function i declare a struct and then i return the address to that variable in that struct to the main function and store that address in some pointer once i have finished executing that function why does that struct still exist in memory when that frame has popped off the the stack
student,i had a bunch of stuff to do so im just starting now a little late i know which files should i start on
student,my matrix test file compiles correctly when running the command make matrixtest however it is failing the autograders compilation test any suggestions on where to proceed
student,i have absolutely no idea what this means any ideas
student,in the autograder the compilation in utiltestscpp fails and i didnt write utiltests so is this a bug from my code causing utiltestscpp to not compile
student,im trying to run schelling in terminal but there must be an infinite loop somewhere because it just keeps running im trying to use the debugger but dont know where to set a break point or how to start trying to find where the problem is located any tips on how to go about finding where the infinite loop might be located or tips on using gdb im trying to follow the spec and went back to lab 1 to review that but still not sure what im doing also should it take a long time to go through the iterations of finding an unsatisfied agent and empty space or should that run pretty quick thanks
student,suppose the center point given to matrixrangeradius is out of the bounds of the matrix however the radius given will include points that lie within the matrix what is the desired effect in this situation should the points that are within the matrix be included in dest or should the function check whether the center point is in bounds initially example center 11 radius 2 thanks
student,is there a way to test matrixprint using assert
student,what are the extra chars stored in dest starting from the are they supposed to be there
student,the destination for my matrixtestrangeradius function doesnt show for some of my duplicated test cases all of the test cases that ive written work with the function but when i duplicate one of the test cases and compile the program the destination still appears for the previous test cases but doesnt appear for the new test case in spite it being the exact same code sometimes the destination appears from a test case that previously didnt show when i rearrange the order of the test cases and sometimes the destination disappears from a test case that previously did work when i rearrange the order of the test cases sometimes it also works when i combine test cases under one function ive checked to make sure that the correct characters are inputted into the destination in the loop with cout after each iteration but after the loop ends the destination doesnt appear im not sure why this happens and will go to office hours tomorrow but i thought i could get some thoughts on here
student,i tried to store the filename into a c string by doing const char filename argv1 but i get an error
student,in the debug output for the schellingdefaultstestdebugoutcorrect i noticed that only the os are ever moved in my old code i accounted for both x and o as possible unsatisfied agents and moved both but the output was not the same as the given when i restricted it so that only os could be moved then i got the correct output are we supposed to move xs at all
student,if we are given a file will the mode always say mode file or can it say mode random
student,in the pdf it says there are two ways to run it with an input file and it also show running it with debugging and just by itself my question is will it always be in this order schelling ­d testdriverrandommodein if not any ideas on how to handle that
student,would ptr point to the first declaration in the struct matrix int numrows or would it automatically start at the array also would cout ptrarray give me the address or the value at the address of the array
student,i was wondering exactly where the elements are for a radius greater than one for instance if the center is in italics and we have radius equal to 2 then am i correct that the ones i have bolded are the only ones that will be in the radius x o x o x o x o x x o x o x o x o x x o x o x o x o x x o x o x o x o x x o x o x o x o x if i am incorrect could someone bold the correct ones that would be in the range thanks in advance
student,im trying to use strcmp to check if d is in the input name or not and my code compiles but i get an error saying excbadaccess code 1 address 0x0 im not really sure how to fix this or whats causing the error
student,what should our program do if percentx percento is not less than 10
student,since there is not a percentage for file mode should we still have a error message for percentage reading for file mode or no
student,see subject
student,we have the correct value for the address of the pointer to the char we want to return but for some reason we cant get that pointer to return accurately the correct address is given by ptrarray index how do we return the pointer to that address
student,is it frowned upon to use global variables in our test suite so if i have a large array that i want to keep reusing i can thanks
student,the spec says by default the simulator will generate a 5 x 5 grid populated with 40 xs 40 os and 20 empty spaces if this doesnt mean that there should be 10 xs 10 os and 5 empty spaces in a 5 x 5 randomly generated grid how do we know when to stop adding xs os and spaces in the grid
student,how are people handling the white spaces in the matrix that arent blank spaces the input files look like they have spaces in between every x o and blank is that right im especially confused about how to deal with real empty spaces versus filler blanks
student,when do we actually use c strings in the project so far weve used c strings in file io and arrays of chars for anything with a matrix but havent needed to use c strings yet
student,see subject

student,randommode contains mode random satisfactionratio 05 size 5 x 5 percentx 04 percento 04 are we just basically generating a random grid and then altering it to make sure its satisfiable isnt this the exact same thing that we do with the default also filemode contains mode file satisfactionratio 05 size 5 x 5 x x x o x x o x x o x o isnt this the same thing as the default except we are given the initial grid instead of creating it randomly which would have produced the grid above
student,our function keeps returning values of addresses that are ten lower than the value it is supposed to return we have tried adjusting our iterations and pretty much everything with no luck can someone help us
student,i just want to do a logic check here lets say that i have a dest with the following x x x o in other words of the 8 agents surrounding x 2 are x 1 is an o and 5 are spaces the agents satisfaction ratio is 23 correct not 28 in other words agents are perfectly fine with not having neighbors but they dont like other kinds of neighbors
student,every time i run random probability to produce the grid i end up having the same elements same order inside the grid note percentx and percenty are unchanged
student,will the autograder tests consist of a matrix that does not have the same number of rows and columns such as 3 by 7
student,just to clarify we no longer have to assert that dest is big enough to hold all items in range correct
student,im confused about why the example debug output doesnt make a move on the line i marked with an arrow stepping through the code the first point 33 and second point 10 are empty and are rejected the third point 01 has an x in it and should be chosen to be moved the fourth point 44 is empty and should be chosen as the destination so why doesnt a move take place on the line i marked it seems like the code skipped a valid move x x x o x x o x x o x o debug eecs280randint5 3 debug eecs280randint5 3 debug eecs280randint5 1 debug eecs280randint5 0 debug eecs280randint5 0 debug eecs280randint5 1 debug eecs280randint5 4 debug eecs280randint5 4 debug eecs280randint5 4 i expected a move before this line debug eecs280randint5 3
student,while i dont need an enum for the project code it makes printing out errors a whole lot nicer can i use them
student,i have a function in matrixtests that i called matrixmaker that initializes a 5x5 matrix i then make an array of xs os and empty spaces and use a for loop to iterate through the array in the matrix struct and the array that i made to populate the array in the matrix struct all of my tests are passing when we cout each element of the array when we input it but if i do not cout inside matrixmaker the tests fail and the contents of the array are empty i thought that this could be an accessing outside of the array problem but then i think it would have the same problem when trying to cout in matrixmaker as well
student,when we randomly select a new location for the agent should we check if that agent is happy in the new location before we move on
student,according to page4 in each iteration we select a random position and move it if its not satisfied but im confused how can determine that all are satisfied do we need an additional loop to do so
student,i wonder how we can see the details of grading of project2 especially the recursion and the style part
student,this may be a trivial question but in the rme for eecs280randint it says effects returns a random integer in the range 0 x prints debug eecs280randintx numbern to stdout in debug mode does this simply mean we cout debug eecs280randintx numbern or is it not that simple
student,whats the difference between this one and cerr filename error reading mode endl
student,when im calling my eecs280randintx where x is number of rows or columns im getting an error saying error use of undeclared identifier eecs280randint im doing something along the lines of int row eecs280randintrows my utilcpp passed the tests given so i dont think theres a problem with util any ideas as to what could be wrong do i need to include utilcpp i dont think so since when we run in terminal were using utilcpp any ideas
student,i just changed all my dereference ptr things in my project to arrow operators and i got ridiculous errors arent they supposed to do the same things what did i do wrong
student,i get 132132 of project 2 autograder and recursion score but i heard that there are also some hand graders to grade styles i just want to know that how many points does code style have
student,need help on project 3
student,are these functions used in this project 3 i didnt use them when writing schelling
student,im stuck on writing eecs280randint because i have an implementation that works but it doesnt match the output that utiltests wants i understand that the random ints generated by genrandint31 arent actually random and are actually seeded and i am only calling genrandint31 once in my function however when i reach the test case asserteecs280randint2 1 the random int generated by genrandint31 is 2080627695 which doesnt even contain a 1 so im confused how i could even make this assertion true
student,if a matrix is initialized as follows matrix m char p m matrixinitp 5 5 if i then immediately call matrixprintp what should be printed should a matrix containing only be printed
student,so are we supposed to put in like an if statment to determine if the program should read from a random mode file or a file mode file or should we expect user input to provide the mode for the program also how do we read in the different types from the files like doubles and ints and strings using a while loop the lecture slides have instructions for when we are reading in all string types i know atoi converts a cstring to an int but what about the double and how exactly are we supposed to use atoi inside the loop right after the number is read or what
student,it is pretty unclear in the specs so can someone please describe to me what we are looking for in terms of errors i know the basic one of if a file fails to open and i saw a post on if something like mode is misspelled but my question is a bit larger than that like say the error is from reading mode which i imagine would happen if the mode is something other than file or random or if it is just missing well still not too hard to think about because we would probably be reading the mode in as a string as we would the next item in the input file now my confusion starts to come in with size my first question is this will anything ever be absent as a potential for error for example if the lines for size in the input file read size x 5 then i would be reading x in as an integer because i was expecting an int before it is this a case we need to guard against second question what would happen if a non integer value from an input file was read in as an integer because i know string str 5 could be a thing but int integer hello shouldnt ever be a thing just in general the cases we have to look out for are incredibly unclear and some of them seem to have a fair bit of complexity
student,how are we supposed to read in a space when reading from a file my istream keeps failing or it will skip the spaces
student,i am confused as to where i am supposed to start i know it reads in from a file but i am having a hard time understand what shellingcpp is supposed to do
student,ive been stuck on matrixrangeradius can someone give me some hints on how to approach it i dont understand how to properly get the pointer to point to the first element to be added when the radius exceeds the dimensions of the matrix
student,hi ive noticed while writing my test cases that flushing cout produces the correct output if i do not flush cout and do not use endl often then random errors will appear in my output especially while using matrixprint and printing dest from rangeradius is flushing a legal operation if not what errors in code design can lead to these kinds of errors thanks
student,for matrixsearchrandom since we are only able to call eecs280randint twice what is the expected method for randomly choosing a cell matching char c we are instructed to call the random function once for row and second for col but then what are we expected to do if the character at that locations doesnt match c i can think of options but i expect there is something specific we need to do in order for our solution to match the expected solution
student,do we need to make test cases for both matrixat and the constant version of matrixat since the code is an exact duplicate im asking this because im using matrixinit in my test case which has a matrix ptr as a parameter but the constant version of matrixat requires a constant matrix ptr making matrixinit useless would it be okay if we just made a test case for matrixat and not the constant version or would that result in a loss of points
student,the output that i get i believe is technically a correct solution but it is not the correct solution x x x x x x x o o x o o this is what i get after 3 iterations i only call eecs280randint once each time i need a new random cell 1 time for the row 1 time for the column so is there anything else that could cause me to be off from the spec solution
student,iv read through the spec a lot of times and am trying really hard to understand it but am still extremely confused and would like to ask some clarifying questions so i understand when running the default we print an initial grid then run a simulation and print a new grid what exactly are we trying to achieve with the new grid are we just making sure that every agent has a satisfaction ratio of 5 what are we trying to accomplish when we reading from a files testdriverrandommode seems to have the same constraints as the default so what is the difference between using the default and reading from that file also what are we trying to accomplish with reading from testdriverfilemode
student,our code uses infinite loops ie whiletrue at different points is this okay to use in terms of style
student,i checked my string and they are the same however strcmp gives 0 so what could possibly happened
student,i cant open the file unless the command is executed like this schelling testdriverrandommodeintxt rather than schelling testdriverrandommodein as specified by the project specs is this correct should i manually add a txt extension to my argv cstring or assume the file will be passed in with an extension
student,so the matrix contains xs os and blank what does blank means is it a space like or it is exactly nothing like
student,my argv2 contains this seems to conflict with the description of whats supposed to happen elsewhere on here any ideas about whats going on im taking the command line input straight from the makefile commands
student,in the dos and donts section of the spec it says that we should use c strings to read from files and cstrings everywhere else are we allowed to use c strings when parsing the strings read in from an input file for example when i read a line from the file the resulting line is a c string but then i have a function to parse that line get the mode satisfactionratio dimensions etc is it okay to use c strings to parse each line or should i use cstrings for that i guess im really just asking if parsing each line of the file is considered reading from the file or if it is considered a completely separate process
student,on page 4 of the spec it specifies that percentx 04 and percento 04 for a 5 x 5 grid however right below when it generates a random grid it only produces 8 xs and 4 os shouldnt it generate 10 xs 10 os and 5 spaces
student,when i run the entire command g ­pedantic ­wall ­werror ­o1 matrixtestscpp matrixcpp utilcpp ­o matrixtests to compile my files theres no error and the compilation is successful however when i run the simplified command make matrixtests i get an error in matrixtestscpp file for the function given to us already testminimumsizematrix saying that i have an undefined reference to matrixinit as well as matrixsize how come make matrixtests leads to an undefined reference error and not running the entire command whats the problem with make matrixtest
student,my program is taking a large number of iterations to solve the grid is this ok
student,when i run the schelling simulator i get a correct output according to the requirements of the spec each agent is not a minority in its neighborhood this is my output x x x x x x x x o o o o this took 21 iterations as opposed to 8 would there be something wrong with the way im generating my random numbers for why this would be happening
student,my question is just what kind of things are we looking for with errors for example with the size parameters are we printing out an error if the dimensions arent valid or are we leaving that to the assert statements then there are 2 cases that i can think of in which we would need to print out errors my question is if we need to handle either one or both the first is if the file is just empty or if whats in the file isnt valid input for example file satisfactionratio 05 size 5 x 5 or mode file satisfactionratio 05 5 x 5 because when we read in from a file we have to read in each word or number one at a time so with bad things would happen if we didnt account for the absence of one of the words the other case which would be much easier to deal with mode satisfactionratio 05 size 5 x when there are just missing parameters this case would be easier to deal with because i think its easier to tell when you read a string for an int rather than an int for a string another question i have is what would happen if we tried to read in a string for an int im assuming these are the only two kinds of cases we have to account for when dealing with these errors not including when opening file but do we have to account for both of them
student,when generating the blanks for our matrices do we need to fill them with spaces or is leaving them null just as good
student,i just realized that the matrix thats provided in mode file has extra spaces than what is needed for example the 5 x 5 matrix is actually 10 x 10 due extra spacing is the file formatted correctly or am i missing something
student,im trying to debug in xcode and ive gotten my folder structure or preferences all out of wack does anyone know how to set it up so that my executables are in the same folder as my files so that i can read from things like testdriverfilemodein
student,i couldnt tell from the example given to use because it didnt actually initialize a matrix how might we go about initializing an actual matrix or array rather for a matrix struct would it be something of the form matrixarray yay this is an array of things
student,what if any are the functions in matrixcpp that we do not have to make tests for in matrixtestscpp
student,given that we have a file that has this written in it mode file satisfactionratio 05 size 5 x 5 x x x o x x o x x o x o are we supposed to analyze the grid for the percentx and percento of the grid
student,do we need to submit a test for matrixprint in matrixtestcpp i tested my matrixprint function by using the diff checker that was recommended in previous posts
student,when the instruction says that the input files are properly formatted what does it mean is that saying everything is in order but there could be some data missing the order would not be random
student,can anybody tell me whats setting debug to flag mean
student,we are told use a static global variable in utilcpp to remember if debug mode is enabled i am not sure what this means have we learned about global variables does this mean just doing something like static bool gdebug false at the top of the file
student,how cando we need to test matrixprint since i cant think of a good way to do that with asserts
student,in this case do we call eecs280randint for the row then the column then do we check if it is occupied and if not find new numbers and repeat if it is occupied we check if it is unsatisfied and if not we repeat the process i am asking this to make sure that i call the random functions the same amount of times
student,my understanding so far is that if there is a d in the command line then it means we need to enable debug mode i can start to think of how i would do that with argv and argc but i have no ideal what the input bool flag is doing or what it is ive searched around everywhere so this is probably a bit of a stupid question but can someone please help me
student,running the autograder gives us an 88 however it says the return code for matrixtestscpp is incorrect we have tried to even comment all our code out of that file so that there is no way it could fail and it still says that the return code is incorrect please help
student,sorry but this is fairly unclear to me are we supposed to use argv and argc for schelling too also for reading from files should we assume there will only be 2 file names and then one situation where there isnt one
student,i am writing the testcase for matrixprint and i dont know how to use assert for print
student,getting the error in the terminal matrixtestscpptext0x172 undefined reference to matrixnumcolumnstestmatrix const matrixtestscpptext0x17a undefined reference to matrixnumrowstestmatrix const matrixtestscpptext0x19f undefined reference to matrixcoltestmatrix const char const matrixtestscpptext0x1aa undefined reference to matrixrowtestmatrix const char const can anyone tell me what this even remotely means ive declared function prototypes and all of these functions are void so im confused as to where this is coming from my matrixat test will still compile it might be that i havent put values into the actual array
student,im trying to test my matrixtestscpp file by running make matrixtests i get an error saying no rule to make target matrixcpp needed by matrixtests stop ive already tested utilcpp and it passed so i dont think thats a reason for the error does anyone know what this means
student,so i am working on the project right now and i seem to keep getting an error when i am trying to initialize an array of integers with the size of my array of characters when setting the size i am using pointers to the respective numrows and numcols the line looks like this int newarrayptrnumrows ptrnumcolumns the error we get is iso c forbids variable length array newarray werror vla how do we troubleshoot
student,im trying to check the size of my matrix which i set to have 99 rows and cols when i type up my assert however the number for size is in the thousands and the assert will not compile i know were not allowed to use ndebug library but how am i supposed to check if my matrix will not go out of bounds for the requires thanks matrixtestscpp7634 error macro assert passed 2 arguments but takes just 1 assertmatrixsizeptr 9801 matrixtestscpp in function ‘ void testmatrixsize ’ matrixtestscpp762 error ‘ assert ’ was not declared in this scope assertmatrixsizeptr 9801 matrixtestscpp7726 error invalid operands of types ‘ const char 12 ’ and unresolved overloaded function type ’ to binary ‘ operator ’ cout size passed endl
student,my matrixcpp finally passed all my test cases so i tried running matrixpublictestcpp it doesnt compile did this happen to anyone else or is it supposed to run out of the box the error message says undefined reference to and then lists all of the function declarations in matrixh
student,do we need to include an rme clause for each of our test cases in matrixtestscpp or just for the function sin matrixcpp
student,if we read from a file with mode file then when we read in the provided matrix will something like infilecharacter also give us all of the empty spaces or will it just skip over them
student,in the header file the requires clause reads requires a solution exists ptr points to a nonnull matrix you must check the requires clause using assert checking if ptr is not null is easy enough but do we need to also make sure that a solution exits by using a function we have already implemented
student,if we are reading in files that are file mode can we assume that the grid they contain is valid i cant find anything in the spec that addresses whether or not we should we should deal with files with custom grids that are invalidempty
student,i can think of an instance in which the agents can never all be satisfied satisfactionratio 06 size 2 x 2 percentx 025 percento 050 the system converges to this or an equivalent variant equivalent in the sense that the x and one of the o is never satisfied o o x how are we supposed to handle this case i havent found any explicit recommendation so far other than keep randomly moving stuff until all agents are satisfied but if thats the case the program wont halt with this input configuration even though there will be moves available to try so the search for an acceptable configuration would continue while working out exactly what sorts of configurations are satisfiable is quite an interesting problem im not sure its the problem im being graded on
student,were allowed to use using namespace std right just want to make sure we can do that instead of for example stdcout every time thanks
student,underscores stand for empty locations x o x x n x x o end of file vs x o x x n x x o n end file sorry if this is vague i can expand if necessary
student,ive looked up this problem on piazza and other places and ive looked back on lectures slides and now im terribly confused my confusion began with me trying to figure out how to put an empty character in dest for matrixrangeradius now im not even sure what the difference is between a cstring and a character array i know the difference is supposed to just be that cstrings end with a null character but is that it and how would you declare a character array vs a cstring how do you tell them apart if someone also could help point me in the right direction on having a character that represents an empty space then that would be nice
student,hi ive read all the different threads on this issue here is where my problem is matrixtests compilation check compilation success return code incorrect score for matrixtests compilation check total 11 everything else on the autograder is either a success or a correct in addition when i use make test everything passes including matrixtests i do not fail any asserts matrixtests ends with return 0 can anyone help
student,is there ever a case in schellingcpp where the radius 1 i understand that the matrixrangeradius function should be able to handle radii other than 1 however in schelling is it safe to assume that the radius used is 1 if not where are we to read in other radii thank you
student,i understand that destsize is used as a pointertoint and that it isnt declared as const but im not sure why i was going to write my matrixrangeradius function in such a way that destsize might have to change but since dest is an array is it correct that destsize shouldnt be able to change
student,the spec and rme are unclear as to what our terminal output is supposed to look like does number n mean that we print the number followed by an endl ex debug eecs280randintx 1 debug eecs280randintx 3 thank you previous replies to similar questions are unclear
student,void matrixrangeradiusconst matrix src int rowcenter int colcenter int radius char dest int destsize requires dest big enough to hold all items in range do we assume that destsize points to to the correct size of dest given radius for example can we assume destsize 9 when radius is 1 destsize 1 when radius is 0 destsize 25 when radius is 2 or do we need to assign destsize given the radius im not sure how to check that dest is big enough if were not given a correct destsize
student,are we not allowed to use constcast in some situations ive found that i need to use constcast to avoid an error message const matrix ptr for int i constcastcharptrarray is there a better way to traverse by pointer through an constant array
student,ive looked over the sample tests that are supplied and read piazza posts but i can not figure out how to test this function very confused on how to do this i think the sample code is confusing more that code is char buffer10 int buffersize 0 matrixrangeradiusp 0 0 0 buffer buffersize assertbuffersize 1 assertbuffer0 x is this code used to test matrixrangeradius because unlike the other function theres no sample test for radius
student,effects returns the first cell matching c the function returns a type char what exactly is a cell i initially thought it was a pointer to the element in the array in the matrix struct but it asks for a return of type char so what is it that we are returning
student,for anyone starting to like vim or wishes to code like lightning i would highly recommending this vimrc because it comes with tons of great preconfigured plugins and key bindings with 0 work httpsgithubcomamixvimrc
student,i cant figure out how to write to the debug file from matrixcpp i declare my file stream in schellingcpp and i cant figure out where else i would include it other than a header file so that it was usable in all files but since i cant modify header files im lost can someone point me in the right direction
student,like assertptr
student,how do we know when to break out of our main loop since we are randomly selecting things i cant tell when everyone is satisfied
student,ive been running tests on my matrixcpp files and everything was working fine and then today this error message happened matrixtestscpptext0x8f undefined reference to matrixnumrowsmatrix const matrixtestscpptext0xb9 undefined reference to matrixnumcolumnsmatrix const matrixtestscpptext0xf9 undefined reference to matrixatmatrix int int matrixtestscpptext0x12b undefined reference to matrixrowmatrix const char const matrixtestscpptext0x15b undefined reference to matrixcolmatrix const char const tmpcchcspvho in function testbasicmatrix matrixtestscpptext0x1a6 undefined reference to matrixinitmatrix int int matrixtestscpptext0x1b2 undefined reference to matrixsizematrix const matrixtestscpptext0x1dc undefined reference to matrixnumrowsmatrix const and so on why is this happening and yes i am including matrixh
student,my printf works for every value except for 00975 which it rounds as 0098 is there another method i should be using instead of printf another thread says use precision from ofstream but i dont see anywhere in the spec that allows us to use ofstream
student,even though we have had monday and tuesday off this week will discussion sections still be meeting on wednesday thursday and friday also will there be a lab due next sunday the 25th
student,one of the requirements in the requires clause is that a solution exists do we have to use assert to test this requirement as well as that ptr points a nonnull matrix if so how do we test that a solution exists should we assert that our matrixsearchsimple function doesnt return a value of null
student,what should the default grid be i know that it will be a 5x5 grid with 40 x 40 o and 20 blanks but do we use the random probability to determine what the grid is
student,in the project spec where we are told what errors to output to the screen satisfaction ratio is misspelled as satifaction ratio should we misspell satisfaction for our project or not
student,we wrote cout r c dest endl in our matrixrangeradius function to print out the value of dest with the corresponding matrix coordinates as seen below this output was exactly as expected however when we printed out our dest variable in matrixtests with the line cout dest four destfour we saw that a was inserted into our c string at the 1 index this caused the assert for the first index to stop the program why is it that the character is being replaced with the character is it an unavoidable problem concerning c strings and cout or is there something that we are doing wrong also this only happens for our matrix that isnt a perfect square the inputs for matrixrangeradius are row 4 col 0 and radius 2 thanks
student,in the header for matrixsearchsimple does return null mean that we should return a pointer to the character 0 since i have to return a pointer to a thing that isnt local to the function and it has to be a character pointer im confused about how its possible to return null from the function
student,the rme says the function does not go off the edge of the matrix but rather truncates the range can someone clarify what this means if mcenter ncenter 0 3 and radius 1 and src x o o x x x o x o o do we get dest oxxxoo
student,do we have lab this week
student,i know we can compare files but thats in the command line not done in a function
student,why in matrixrangeradius is one of the arguments int destsize wouldnt it be easier for it just to be an int what is the point of it being a pointer to an int
student,whats the difference between cerr and cout and for file mode with exact input there is not a percentage at all do we still need to have the percentage error message for the file with exact input maybe when there happens to be a percentage information
student,my autograder says the score for project 2 is out of 68 but when i add everything that gets graded i only add to 66 is there something im missing there
student,i am getting this error when i run make matrixtests matrixcpp in function the name of my function im using it in error eecs280randint was not declared in this scope it seems like the functions in utilcpp are not accessible in matrixcpp when i run matrixtests how do i fix this i got a few other errors saying the same sort of thing with functions in utilcpp
student,i have been writing code for each functions and testing them and it has been working fine but now i have run into this error where my build fails when i try to run it in xcode and test and i get clang error linker command failed with exit code 1 use v to see invocation or when i do make matrixtests in terminal i get error no new line at end of file werrorwnewlineeof saying that it occurs in my last line of the matrixtestscpp file i have all of the allowed libraries included as well as the h files any help thanks
student,are we allowed to use the function from mt19937 or util i want to generate random matrix for test cases
student,matrixsize numrow and numcolumns all use matrixinit in the test file so how can we test matrixinit the same thing with matrixat
student,do we have to make structs in our test file and use the functions on them but how are we suppose to figure out what address they should return
student,out of curiosity what happens if you dont manage to finish the project on time do you just fail
student,i am still very confused about how to parse in data while still being able to account for errors for instance if we are to read in percent x as finix where x is a double that is supposed to percentx value if there is no value inputted this will read in the next nonnull character which would be a string on the next line this would cause an invalid type error that we would not be able to catch on the flip side if we were to read in as getline we would have no ability to turn the string into a double as atoi converts to an integer
student,when being called the point that is in the array at index 0 is that technically at row 1 column 1 or is that at row 0 col 0
student,ive been stuck on this function for quiet a while now i can get it to work when the radius is less than both rowcenter and colcenter but for cases that are on the edges or where either one of rowcenter or colcenter is less than radius i am stuck how do i loop through a subsection of the matrix when certain parts of it are outside of the matrix
student,so ive been using the 5x5 matrix that was in the specs as a test my program does actually work and moves all the elements until theyre satisfied however its not the same output as what is in the specs i read up on other postings and have seen that if this occurs something is wrong i couted every time i called for a random integer and compared it with the specs and they were different any idea why this is happening i feel like if the random integers were correct it would solve it correctly
student,so i read through the other questions on piazza and im still confused do we assume that the data in array in matrix is ordered from leftright and topbottom especially in matrixsearchsimple where we have to find the first rowmajor location for a char
student,the rme says the function returns a range of items within a rectangular radius but since the function is of type of void doesnt it not have a return type do you want us to print the range of items instead
student,do we need to account for trying to read in empty files i think that this should signal an error reading mode error but im not sure if this is something we need to account for
student,trying to figure out matrix range radius function after iterating through rows and columns to get the character i want i call char character matrixatsrc row col to get the character i want to add to my array dest from here since i want to add the character to an array what do i do i know i am not copying characters into arrays i was thinking about concatenating but got stuck because the character variable is a char not a char i just dont know how to add it to dest do i use indices and treat it like an array
student,im confused as to how we check that something was successfully read from a file can i just say ifvar null yay we read it
student,if we want to use a couple static global matrices in the matrixtestscpp file instead of copying and pasting the code in each test function is that allowed
student,so i searched for the autograder saying incorrect for matrixtests return code and the consensus was that the tests were failing at the wrong point i commented out all of my tests cases even the included one and it still says that the return code is incorrect could there be something wrong with the autograder or am i doing something wrong thanks
student,i did not use every matrix function we wrote in matrixcpp for my simulation in schellingcpp but it works is that allowed
student,for eecs280randint is there a reason why we cant just multiply the random decimal by x and then truncate the result in order to generate a random integer between 0 and x the project expects some other implementation but it seems to me this would be the simplest by far
student,for matrix tests are we to assume that the only characters in the matrix are xs and os and no other characters
student,our main loop is supposed to operate as long as all elements within the matrix are not satisfied my idea was to create a function that checks all elements of a matrix array to see if they are satisfied this function would then be used in the main while loop once all elements are satisfied the main while loop will break and the final matrix will be printed out is this the right idea or is there something simpler
student,i have the following code to make a matrix to test my functions on matrix matrix a b c d e f g h i matrix ptr matrix matrixinitptr33 which is supposed to create a 3x3 matrix a b c d e f g h i my issue is that when i call matrixatptr 0 0 it continually returns a pointer to the c element i have been at this same problem for a very long time now and i cannot seem to come up with any more ideas as to why this is occurring i have been searching for indexing errors as that is what i initially thought was the problem but was unable to find any any insight on this problem would be much appreciated
student,is there a way to use assert to see if matrixrangeradius works or is it like the tests for matrixprint where we have to use diff if we do have to use diff how do we put our result in another file so that we can compare it with the correct one
student,i know how to represent the address of the object class pointer ptr and i know how to represent a member of an object class ptrnumcolumns or ptrarray0 but how do i get the address of array0 ptrarray0 does not seem to or look like it should work im trying to build the matrixrow matrixcolumn and matrixat functions
student,is it okay to just use matrixinit in all of our test cases in matrixtestscpp
student,can we assume that all the files that we will be given for the schellingcpp reading will follow the same formatting for each line as the example files namely random file mode random satisfactionratio 05 size 10 x 10 percentx 04 percento 04 file files mode file satifactionratio 05 size 5 x 5 x x x o x x o x x o x o so i guess my question is if the 2nd line of the random file will always have satisfactionratio or can the line differ from file to file
student,if so how will a radius larger than one be passed into the terminal
student,the autograder keeps failing my util and saying there is a compilation error when it runs fine on linux and everything else we get 78 on the autograder as util tests is the only thing that fails is there a simple mistake i may be making thanks
student,can we use a for loop such as for int i 0 i 5 i etc this isnt my code just using this as an example in our code to print out the matrix or would using the for loop that declares int i be illegal
student,sorry if there was already a question like this asked i tried searching but didnt find one specific enough to this case when we call eecs280randintx to get a random row and random column for matrixfindrandom this should be the values corresponding with the row and column number not the zero indexed version correct i am running into an issue with the case with a 1 by 1 matrix i use the number of rows and number of columns as my x values for the two calls however it seems like eecs280randintx only ever returns the value 0 when called with x 1 therefore i can never find a location of a desired char in matrixfindrandom because i will never get a valid rowcolumn combination should this be happening any suggestions
student,is everything in schelling done inside the main function or should we break it up into functions which we call from main
student,are we supposed to test the functions in utilh with more than the tests in utiltestscpp if so could you explain how we would go about this and if so are these tests supposed to conducted in matrixtestscpp just a little confused on how we would do this
student,i am attempting to use code similar to this forint i 0 i sizesomething i ptrarrayi x is this valid allowed on this project or do i have to use a pointer to point to that array specifically and then increment that
student,so matrixat takes in a row and column and returns a pointer of that point in the array so is that row and column basically what matrixrow and matrixcol return so if i pass in location into matrixrow and matrixcol it would the row and col which if i then passed that row and col into matrixat i would get the original location back so theyre inverses
student,genrandint31 returns a long whereas were returning an int in the eecs280randint if i set what genrandint31 returns to as a long should i staticcastint the variable in the return statement or should i have the variable genrandint31 be type int
student,when reading the exact input what should be the error message when failed to do so it does not have agent percentages does that mean we do not have to have error message for it
student,im having trouble making the probability print only three significant figures how would i go about doing this thanks
student,assuming locationptr holds the address of the first element in a one dimensional array of chars array so char locationptr array am i correct in assuming that the expression array 5 locationptr will return a value of 5 also will changing the type of variable stored in the array alter this result thanks
student,im a bit confused at what im supposed to do here i believe that im suppose to use argc and argv to check for d from the command line but im not sure how to use either of those outside of the int main should i have that in the utilcpp then i cant run my program because there are two mains present or is my approach all wrong
student,a common error i get when trying to compile is control reaches end of nonvoid function there are int functions where i have my return statement inside of a loop or if statement when i add something like return 0 at the end of the functions i get this error for the error goes away why is this
student,can there be the case where the center point is out of range of the source matrix but the radius matrix of that center point includes elements in the source matrix range it doesnt say in the requires clause that the center point must be in the range of the source matrix but in effects it says that it always includes the center point which could not be the case if the center point is out of range can you please clarify this concept thanks
student,when testing my matrixrangeradius function i found that my strings never pass the assert even when they appear to be identical in every way ive even printed them out and compared them myself and they are exactly the same originally one of the strings was quite long but i inserted a sentinel in the appropriate place and the cout reflects this what on earth could be causing this issue
student,effects initializes the number of rows and columns of a matrix requires numrowsin maxnumrows and numrowsin 0 numcolumnsin maxnumcolumns and numcolumnsin 0 im guessing these comparisons should be inclusive especially since the first test case initializes a matrix of size zero and expects it to pass
student,in matrixcol i am trying to create a matrix of size maxnumrows maxnumcolumns and then assign it to be ptr array but it is giving me two errors 1 that my matrix may not be initialized 2 incompatible types in assignment of char10000 to charsizetypessizetypesize 1 1 what is my problem
student,i used diff to check the output of my files and they match but after uploading the files to the autograder the autograder gave me a 68 with these two outputs wrong what is wrong with my program
student,will the autograder compile our code with werror as the makefile does or is that purely for debugging purposes specifically im trying to return a null pointer by not initializing but im getting the warning warning index may be used uninitialized in this function wmaybeuninitialized however im being exceedingly careful to make sure that i am not passing an initialized pointer to any other function is this bad style am i good
student,if i do make utiltests and nothing outputs but it compiles does that mean it ran correctly and passed all the asserts
student,is the array within a matrix a cstyle string specifically does it have 0 at the end of the array of xs os and spaces
student,if reading from a file fails i know were supposed to use the cerr commands but should we also exit the program if not how should the matrix be initialized with the default settings like if we were able to get valid code up until the matrix size should we use those values and then the defaults after that also will the files being read from always be set up the same way like could we get a file that has everything but one of the middle information lines like matrix size or would it just be a file that ends prematurely without matrix size and everything after it im not sure how to set up my code to catch all of the information but also account for potential errors
student,does the char array defined in the matrix struct have to be initialized here i keep getting the error invalid array assignment when i try to assign an empty char array of the max size to the pointed to array in struct
student,ive submitted my code to the autograder and i get 88 with everything being correct except for matrixtests matrixtests compilation check compilation success return code incorrect score for matrixtests compilation check total 11 it says that the return code is incorrect but ive still gotten full points does this indicate that theres something wrong with matrixtestscpp or matrixcpp my matrixtestscpp runs fine so what does being incorrect imply that a test case fails when it shouldnt that some function wasnt being tested that faulty code passes my tests im not sure exactly what to fix if i dont know what the correct test code is supposed to be
student,is there any reason for one to use and not just divide with nx would just give you the remainder of n after dividing by x right so would we just choose any x for our code when we are making the number smaller and if we did nx we would still be making the number smaller as long as x1 so why not use this instead of
student,is genrand31 supposed to produce the same number each time i keep getting the same number 1749605806 is this what is supposed to happen
student,the example in the effects clause assigns the value 9 to destsize but wouldnt that cause a type mismatch because destsize is a pointer to int not an int according to the given parameters
student,i know there have been lots of posts about this func but im still confused how do we assign a new size to the matrix array pointed to if its initialized as a const size and should we have a helper function in matrix that handles file io or does that belong directly in schellingcpp
student,im confused if the file name will always be the same or if we have to account for different names also when you are typing in arguments in the command line such as schelling schellingdefaultstestout does the output file after the count as an argument thanks
student,do we need to create tests for util in matrixtestscpp since the util functions are so simple i would think the utiltestscpp file given to us would catch any errors
student,i dont see this anywhere in the provided files can someone help me find it or is it not actually given in a file for us
student,what are the acceptable values of the satisfaction ratio ie what values should cause an error
student,for schelling the random case of the matrix my understanding is that we need to prompt the user for the satisfaction ratio size percentx and percento is the autograder looking for us to prompt satisfaction ratio and then wait for a user input of 05 and for size should we expect x for the input every time
student,are we allowed to use mod and ceil functions for the project i know the spec says not to include any other libraries and i dont think theyre defined in any of the ones were allowed to use thanks
student,i am just making sure i understand in function matrixat the int row and int col do not act as x and y values correct if row 1 and col 0 for example that would be in the second row and the first column starting from the upper left corner
student,for some reason it shows the line before after is different than the correct file why is this happening thanks
student,i am confused as to how the array is being stored if i have the matrix x o x o o o is the array x o x o o o
student,this is included in the project spec running the program the schelling simulator takes several command line arguments to determine what kind of simulation to run they have sensible defaults so you can run a simulation without command line options remember don’t type the “” schelling are we supposed to be in a certain directory do we have to compile our schellingcpp first do we have to run the makefile when i try to run schelling there is no such file or directory
student,i was unsure what to return in the matrix simple search do you want to return a value or return the coordinates of the first match thank you
student,so i read through the other posts about matrix init and we dont initialize the array there but i am confused where the array is being initialized and i see that there are different ways to store the values in a 1d array but i am just lost where this process is happening thanks
student,for this function it says to call eecs280randint for both row and col if it matches the i just return the address of that cell if the random ints dont match would i just keep calling eecs280randint until i get a match
student,how exactly do we check if a solution exists in this function do we only call eecs280randint twice thats all we do
student,i know someone said we shouldnt assume the radius is 1 but where would we get what the radius is
student,im referring to functions matrixrow and matrixcol
student,for the matrixrangeradius function we are supposed to modify the values in dest to the values of the smaller portion of the src are the values without an x or o null and if so how do we assert that both values are the same i tried to print out both to compare but the null values give me an issue
student,when testing matrixat is it sufficient to just dereference the pointer that is returned and assert that charchar i see that it works in the public test case but that was just one row and column what if were dealing with more rows and columns where there will be more than one x and o is it still a thorough enough method to just compare the objects or am i just overthinking this
student,i was comparing my random probability to the the probability in the correct output file however it turned out that the correct probability should be rounded to have 3 nonzero integer in its decimals debug eecs280randprobability 0814724 debug eecs280randprobability 0815 debug eecs280randprobability 00975404 debug eecs280randprobability 00975 how can we round the probability without using setprecision from the iomanip library thanks
student,is whiletrue something we know will return return x bad style
student,everything compiles when i take it out
student,im a little confused as to how to approach the matrixrow function using location ptr since locationptr is a pointer to a char does this mean it points to an x or an o in the matrix and then we need to find the row and column of that xo would we approach this by doing something along the lines of we have a matrixsize function and we can find the number of rows and columns in that matrix and then somehow we would use that to find the the row and column of locationptr if thats true can someone please point me in the right direction as to how to do that thanks
student,ive read through the posts pertaining to the row and column functions and i just wanted to clarify how things are indexed arrays are indexed starting at 0 however rowscolumns will start at 1 ie if your matrix has 1 row and 1 column the matrixrow will return a value of 1 not 0 is that correct
student,when we were trying to take in an array from file there was a blank line that getline kept taking before the actual array we checked the file and there is no blank line after size 5 x 5 are we meant to print that inital blank line before the matrix the only way the blank line wasnt printed was if we had an extra getline before we actually took the matrix in but were not sure if we should be doing that
student,will the d flag always occur before the file name that is in argv1 in addition will the file name occur in argv2 thanks
student,so after checking if the point is within the matrix bounds and also within the radius how do we add that point to the dest array should i create a different matrix somehow and add the points by looping through that array and using matrixat
student,all of the matrix examples dealt with in the specs are square that is the number of rows and number of columns are the same will our functions also be expected to deal with matrices that are not square thanks
student,i feel like schellingcpp is quite messy and confusing without creating a function that can be called to carry out the process to compute the array for example include iostream using namespace std void foo int mainint argc char argv if call upon foo else if call upon foo return 0 void foo foo calls upon functions in utilcpp and matrixcpp to complete the task in schelling
student,im trying to check whether a cell in the matrix exists or not in order to add to dest however i realized that if the row or col is outside the range of the set rows and columns the assert in matrixat will stop it from proceeding how can i check that a cell is null if the assert in matrixat will prevent me from seeing whether the cell is within the matrix or not
student,im having trouble with figuring out how to return a character pointer from a function ive tried to create the pointer inside the function but that results in weird errors because as soon as the function returns the pointer dies is there a safe way to do what i want i cant think of any way that works heres what i have int main cout function this doesnt work because the pointer is dead return 0 char function char c 0 char cptr c return cptr
student,im a bit confused as to how i am accessing the elements of src matrix and adding them to dest i am trying to call matrixat on the first element in the neighborhood of the center point top left point and then i am trying to add all the elements of this row that are still in radius to def if i call matrixat then i get a pointer to the location of the element in the matrix struct array how are these elements of matrix src getting intto the array though
student,the output of my simulation is a mirror image to he simulator solution from the project spec for example the project spec says that the orignial grid original x x x o x x o x x o x o should become this x x x x x x x o x o o o but my code takes the original and makes this x x x x x x x x o o o o is this a problem or is our answer correct if this will be an issue how might i start finding my bug
student,for the effects portion of matrixrangeradius it says items are returned in dest in order from lefttoright toptobottom this ordering is not so clear to me given the example above the function could you clarify how the elements in the matrix are arranged in dest thanks
student,im working at the matrixtestcpp do i need to test the matrixprint function how to compare the expected print result and actual print result
student,should the size function return the number of initialized values in the array or the maximum number rows columns
student,hi i submitted my code through autograder and it got full points however it says that matrixtests return code is incorrect does it means that i have to modify my code untill it shows that the return code is correct thank you
student,when there is a file with exact spec of matrix is the first line always mode file and when it is random mode it is alwaysmode random
student,when should i use it on the donts it tells me dont use cerr to send any output to standard error but it also ask me to use cerr to repot errors on page5 what does that mean
student,if there is a matrix a b c d e f g h i j k l m n o p q r s t u v w x y z 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 and the center is y with a radius of 2 what would that look like i j k l m p q r s t w x y z 1 4 5 6 7 8 11 12 13 14 15
student,if i have a file with specific input how should i read in those in the matrix are they not auromatically skipped
student,i am confused about when to trigger the file parsing errors when i originally typed the function i assumed that all files would be formatted correctly ie all files would contain size mode et cetera in the same order regardless of whether the size was reasonable or the mode was a recognized mode is this an incorrect assumption should we expect formatting errors such as someone misspelling mode or the lack of a mode whatsoever will some files contain the lines in a different order than the samples
student,void matrixrangeradiusconst matrix src int rowcenter int colcenter int radius char dest int destsize i am confused about how i will test destsize the length of dest will be determined by the rowcenter colcenter and radius destsize are calculated after we do calculations with other parameters then how are we supposed to know destsize before calling matrixrangeradius function also so dest is a pointer to array with char that is empty but it will be filled up with appropriate values after we call this function dont we need to give an array its size when we make them meaning we need to know how big the array is going to be before we make the array so if we have a matrix we need to count how many values are going to be stored in dest then using that information make dest array then pass the value to the function
student,hello is the provided test function testminimumsizematrix supposed to assert false all the time i thought numrows and numcolumns werent supposed to be zeroindexed so im just a little worried that my project fails the one test case that was provided thanks
student,how robust should we make our file reaing section of code in other words should we only read files in exact the specified format and reject all others i have in mind extra white space at the end or the beginning or middle of a line also i am thinking of the lables for the values possible being gone this would change how i do this file reading and the specs were not clear on the robustness
student,im not completely certain about how to write the main function my thinking is that you first check whether debug mode is on and if it is you print the extra information as you solve the matrix then you check whether there is a file input if not you create random matrix and solve it otherwise you parse the input file to get matrix and then solve is that correct
student,i have been unable to determine if the center point inputs are guaranteed to be inside the 2d array if not should an assert error be generated or should we see if the radius ends up enclosing part of the array and continue as normal thanks
student,all the lines such as moved o from 1 3 to 0 3 in the two given debugoutcorrect files are missing the left parentheses
student,how does one initialize a matrix with values this would help me test matrixsearchsimple how would i go about testing matrixprint or matrixsearchrandom thanks
student,matrixsearchrandom returns a pointer to character i thought asserting this way using value would be pointless because we obviously know it will give the character o assertmatrixsearchrandomptr o o but then using address you wouldnt know the location of o which is randomly picked assertmatrixsearchrandomptr o
student,is the autograder going to be checking for whitespace match for example if my row ends with a x but would technically end x o x would that be considered poor form or are we just considering the printing as visually correct
student,when using eecs280randint for matrixsearchrandom should we use the number of rows and number of columns as our x input
student,hi testdriverfilemode has a matrix listed inside it does this mean we have to manually recreate that matrix if we input testdriverfile thanks
student,im referring to matrixsize i know i have to multiple the length by the width to get the size i just dont know how to access these amounts from only a pointer to a struct
student,im not sure how i would come up with a unit test for this function since it is void im having the same problem with matrixprint and matrixinit can our test cases just use cout or is this insufficient
student,1354 and 1316 seem to be contradicting each other and i would like to get clarification if possible when accessing elements in the matrix obviously indexing is from 0 since arrays index from 0 in c when determining what row or column an element is in such as in the matrixrow or matrixcol do we count from 0 or 1 for example is the first element in the grid in row 1 column 1 or row 0 column 0
student,i understand that we first check if the values passed into the function are valued with assert but what do we assign them too do we just make up variables to assign those to are we provided specific variables also how can we check if the pointer is not null
student,please correct me if im wrong heres my current understanding of this function we pass in a pointer to a constant matrix src and the coordinates of a point in that matrix row and col this void function is supposed to return a pointer to a character array a c string which is representative of a smaller portion of the matrix and a pointer to an integer value which represents the size of that portion thus its necessary we pass in an int value called radius to specify what portion of the matrix we want because its a void function we dont actually return anything so we pass in a pointer to an empty character array and a pointer to an integer both of which get modified my confusion is really with making this new array am i correct in thinking of this as a pointer to a cstring which is just an empty array of characters when it is first passed in should we be concerned with the size of this cstring at all
student,right now what i did is that i check random occupied spot and if it is not satisfied then i move it to a random empty spot to make it good then after this i would check from the beginning to see whether everyone is satisfied is that acceptable i feel if i do it this way then im centainly wasting the computational power of the computer since check it from the beginning can certainly replace the part which checks random position however the instruction says that we have to follow the pseudocode so i am really confused please hel
student,whats wrong of floating point exception
student,how do we make an empty c string
student,in my matrixat function im attempting to iterate through an array with a for loop that looks like this for char value ptr array value ptr array matrixsize value code this is giving me the error iso c forbids comparison between pointer and integer so just to test my code i tried iterating through a small array in a separate cpp file like so char arr5 b638a for char ptr arr ptrarr 5 ptr cout value ptr endl and this works fine logically the two loops look the same to me obviously besides the use of structs in the first example i have a suspicion that my error may be in the the conditional statement value ptr array matrixsize any help would be appreciated its probably something stupidly obvious thanks
student,when i compare the output of schelling d with the correct output i got this error 36d35 440a440 make test error 1 any help
student,for some reason my files are not passing the matrixpublictest matrixtests are not passing even though they compilerun fine with g on linux help
student,i was wondering if eecs280randint returns a truly random number because when i call eecs280randint i get the same list of random numbers
student,there was a similar question 1096 but it was not answered by instructors how do we test matrixat function with const matrix we cannot use matrixinit for const matrix and so the only way is to use static initializer like this const matrix mymatrix 2 3 x but then it can only initialize the first element of the char array since we cannot do the following only possible in c11 right const matrix mymatrix 2 3 x o 0
student,if the radius entered into the function zero should the destsize be changed to 1 that is does it just change the dest to the item at the coordinates and the destsize is just the size 1 of that one item
student,im having trouble figuring out to do what the function is suppose to do so if a bool flag that is true is passed into the function do i only set the global bool variable to true is that it and then getdebugmode just returns true if the global bool variable is true i
student,so i am still a little confused about this question after reading 1128 is that saying we are allowed to check each cell after each iteration then why should we pick random points at the first place isnt that repetitive
student,i have searched through other posts and i am still confused my first question is just how do i determine how rows and columns are ordered into the matrix is it similar to void matrixrange radius where dest goes from left to right and then top to bottom so would the matrix 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 correspond to the array 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 or in other words if i have a 3 by 3 matrix which is given by a 9 element array then would the element at the location 1 2 correspond to the 5th element of the array my other question is with initializing values so if i wanted to i could set every single element in the array equal to 0 and there would be no problem
student,when altering dest by adding the values to it from the range should we add a 0 at the end to send to it or should we assume that the matrix fits in the cstring which already has a null terminating character at its end
student,in the main loop of schellingcpp since we are applying matrixrangeradius function do we assume that the agents satisfaction only depends on the radius of 1 or where can we find the input radius thanks
student,im asking that if matrixsearchrandom function does not match the desired character at first search does it keep searching or return null
student,i am stuck on how to find the row from a given index of our 1 d array i understand i can access rows and columns from the matrix struct but i cannot figure out how i can find the row or column from a given index of the array inside matrix
student,if dest is only a char not a const char how do we store elements in it from the array of src which is a constant matrix wouldnt dest have to be const char too i was trying to use matrixat to get the elements but that returns a const char which gets a type mismatch when i try to store it in dest thanks
student,i know someone asked this but it was several days ago we are getting the same error message even though we have include matrixh we have a bunch of errors saying that ptr has no type matrix was not declared etc
student,for the passing in of the arguments should dest destsize be passed in like matrixrangeradiuss 1 2 2 dest destsize where s dest is a char and destsize is an int
student,if we are only allowed to check random spots how do we know when to stop iteration
student,is matrixinit supposed to change the size of the array in the matrix struct being referenced by ptr based on the numberrowsin and numbercolumnsin or is it supposed to keep the array size at its previous maximum value and just initialize the other two member variables if it is supposed to change the size of the array how is this possible i receive an error whenever i use the arrow operator to dereference ptr and then try to change the size of the array
student,our matrix initializer works with a pointer to a matrix but not an array of pointers to matrixes for example if we had matrix matrix3 and passed it into matrixinitmatrix1 2 3 we get a exc bad access
student,how do i check if my assert clauses are valid for matrixinit i wanted to an assert in the matrixtest file but im unsure how to go about it for example i wanted matrixinit to fail when trying to make a null matrix or matrix with over 101 columns or rows how would i write that in the matrixtest file thanks
student,im confused about under what conditions would message error reading mode of unrecognized mode be used like if i type schelling testdriverrandommodein but in the file it says mode file it should produce an error message
student,how can use this function when it doesnt take any parameters unsigned long genrandint32void so how can i use this function to get a random num from 0 to x why couldnt i just use rand0x
student,how do i use the assert function to check the requires clause im confused as to how to initialize the matrix i looked at another post about matrix initialization and im still confused
student,i read over the pdf of project 3 and im confused as to where to start do i just make a matrixcpp file and work through the matrixh file im confused on the way to do this project
student,what should the function do for elements that are off the edge of the matrix should it proceed to fill the character array as if those elements dont exist
student,im wondering about the initial contents of arrays after initialization before schellingcpp does its magic in the main loop will the array just be full of garbage matrixinit isnt supposed to initialize any of the values of the array itself is it im thinking about this in the context of testing matrixprint before having written schellingcpp the temporary solution i see is to artificially populate an array with xs os and blanks in matrixtestscpp and then try to print that is there an approach that makes better use of the matrix functions
student,
student,there area few scattered posts about this but i dont think there are any that deal with the whole issue matrixrow and matrixcol are to return 0indexed rows and columns right in addition the rme for matrixinit says that the number of rows and columns must be initiated to something greater than zero so my first big question is whether im right to assume that matrixrow and matrixcol will always be given a pointer to a matrix with at least one row and one column if not how do you return a rowcol integer when there are no rowscolumns and the returned integer zero would already represent the first rowcolumn my second question is whether the matrixnumcolumns and matrixnumrows are zeroindexed as well this is important wrt the first part of the questions since the matrixnumcolumnsrows functions can be utilized within matrixrow and matrixcol so if we have a 1 x 1 array should both matrixnumcolumns and matrixnumrows return 1 as opposed to zero thank you
student,when should we stop the debug iteration if we are not allowed to check from the first one to the last element how to know when the whole thing is without bug and may i write this debug part as a separate function in schellingcpp and call it in the main
student,for the matrixprint function i am looping through the array in the struct and then looping through each array that each pointer in the struct array points to and printing out the characters my loop seems to be going out of bounds and printing a bunch of random data from my computer even though im pretty sure i have the correct limits on my for loop just to make sure i am understanding this the struct array is an array of pointers that point to individual arrays that contain characters from specific rows of the matrix right
student,instructions says that by defaultit should generate a matrix with 40 xs 40os and 20 empty spaces but in fact the number of x and the number of y are not 40 does that simply means percentx 04 and percenty 04
student,when i do matrix default is this pointer pointing to a matrix even if i do not create a matrix first then point the pointer to it first
student,shall we use function genrandres53 or genrandreal2
student,im still confused about the d so when the user put d into the command line how is that debugging first check whethe the generated number meets the requirement then check whether the symbol is satisfied then shou where it is moved to is that all it does
student,if the user run the driver program with onlyschelling program what matrix should that be just randomly create one
student,can we assume all the matrices we will deal with are square same number or rows and columns or can we have something like 2x3 or 4x5 etc
student,when i run matrixpublictest i get a segfault i ran it with gdb and it said the problem was near the end of my matrixrangeradius function and it gave me this message src0x7fffffffb7a0 rowcenter0 colcenter0 radius0 dest0x7fffffffb790 x repeats 200 times destsize0x7fffffffb77c im assuming it has something to do with the repeats 200 times part but why in the world would it repeat 200 times my only guess is theres an endless loop but i cant see where it would be
student,would the mcenter and ycenter be greater than 0 or they could be smaller than0
student,im confused about how should we initialize variables such as satisfactionratio size percentx when reading input from a file
student,for example if we want to examine whether an agent is satisfied can we write a helper function in schellingcpp should we test it
student,the spec tells us to randomly select matrix elements to see if they are happy during the main loop but wouldnt going in order each iteration make more sense for example how would we know when we were done if were searching randomly
student,when writing test cases for things like matrixprint are we allowed to use for regular for loops with indexing and without traversal by pointer to generate matrices for example if i just want to create a sample matrix with xs and os in it i could just use a for loop to do so going up until the matrix size and setting the values equal to either x or o and then i could call my print function to see if it prints what i expect it to
student,what exactly does the radius parameter in the range radius function tell us about the matrix
student,is there a way to use ceil or something like it for project 3 it sounds like we cant include mathh is there another way
student,i was wondering if we are supposed to use precision or another function to round our output for doubles in debug mode or is this acceptable debug eecs280randprobability 0814724 debug eecs280randprobability 0815 debug eecs280randprobability 0135477 debug eecs280randprobability 0135 debug eecs280randprobability 0905792 debug eecs280randprobability 0906 debug eecs280randprobability 0835009 debug eecs280randprobability 0835 debug eecs280randprobability 0126987 debug eecs280randprobability 0127 debug eecs280randprobability 0968868 debug eecs280randprobability 0969 debug eecs280randprobability 0913376 debug eecs280randprobability 0913 debug eecs280randprobability 0221034 debug eecs280randprobability 0221 debug eecs280randprobability 0632359 debug eecs280randprobability 0632 debug eecs280randprobability 0308167 debug eecs280randprobability 0308 debug eecs280randprobability 00975404 debug eecs280randprobability 00975 debug eecs280randprobability 0547221 debug eecs280randprobability 0547 debug eecs280randprobability 0278498 debug eecs280randprobability 0278 debug eecs280randprobability 0188382 debug eecs280randprobability 0188 debug eecs280randprobability 0546882 debug eecs280randprobability 0547 debug eecs280randprobability 0992881 debug eecs280randprobability 0993 debug eecs280randprobability 0957507 debug eecs280randprobability 0958 debug eecs280randprobability 0996461 debug eecs280randprobability 0996 debug eecs280randprobability 0964889 debug eecs280randprobability 0965 debug eecs280randprobability 0967695 debug eecs280randprobability 0968 debug eecs280randprobability 0157613 debug eecs280randprobability 0158 debug eecs280randprobability 0725839 debug eecs280randprobability 0726 debug eecs280randprobability 0970593 debug eecs280randprobability 0971 debug eecs280randprobability 098111 debug eecs280randprobability 0981 debug eecs280randprobability 0957167 debug eecs280randprobability 0957
student,okay so its generally good practice to write atomic unit tests because testing multiple things at once sort of defeats the point of a unit test but im not sure how to go about testing setdebugmode separately from getdebugmode since setdebugmode is a void function iirc were supposed to write at least 1 test case per function i can think of a few ways to go about asserting that a call to setdebugmode wont crash the calling function or program but it looks like we dont cover error handling until the end of the semester can i use getdebugmode in my setdebugmode functions if not is my understanding that we need to write a testcase per function flawed in some way or not applicable to gettersetters if not am i just overlooking some way to test the functionality of setdebugmode without doing error handling or other stuff that wont be covered in the class by the time that the project is due
student,i think im pointing to the address of a particular matrixs array and it couts this pointer w226342215377 that looks neither like an address nor like multiple addresses to me any thoughts about what im looking at here
student,what does return code incorrect mean for the matrixtestscpp
student,i dont know if im missing something but im confused on how to test functions such as matrixrow and where to set a locationptr do we create our own matrices with chars of xs and os and then set a locationptr to a random place and try to generate the row its in thank you
student,is the following matrix o x o x o x represented as the array oxoxox or oooxxx
student,the effects clause for matrixsize specifies that it should return the total number of items in the matrix that has been passed into the function are these items xs and os or are they xs os and blanks that is is this function really asking for the number of slots in the matrix thats being passed into the function
student,this is more of a general question but do cpp files need to have their h counterparts included does matrixcpp need a include matrixh at the top for example or utilcpp a include utilh
student,i added void testmatrixat to matrixtestscpp and now im getting a a couple apple macho linkerid errors the message says undefined symbols for architecture x8664 matrixatmatrix const int int referenced from testmatrixat in matrixtestso and i have no idea what it means any thoughts thanks
student,i tried using ptr array char arrnumrowsin numcolumnsinbut it doesnt work
student,when i run the matrixtests where i initialized a matrix to test functions i get this error extended initializer lists only available with stdc11 or stdgnu11 werror matrix matrix i initialize it with values matrix matrix numrows numcolumns elements of array is this incorrect or is there another reason for this error message
student,i think maybe i understand what the util random functions are supposed to do but im less clear on the the role of the debug ones specifically where are they supposed to be called my best guess at this point is that the update debug output bulletpoint in schellingcpps pseudo code should call the functions to figure out whether theres a d in argv is something like that right
student,i am really confused as to how utiltestscpp my code passes all the assert clauses but im not sure how if you are supposed to generate a random integer in a given range how can you predict what the result is and write an assert for it how do these test cases work
student,i am trying to get the array to point to an specific element by adding certain numbers to ptrarray however i am receiving messages that the operator addition sign has no effect pls help
student,from page 4 in the project spec
student,when running my code through the autograder i get the following the autograder gave 11 points for the matrixtests compilation test but listed return code as incorrect is this something that i should be worried about
student,when i try to access the value of destsize destsize to change the value i am getting a seg fault why and what should i do about it
student,the rme states that the address of locationptr is within the matrix does this refer to the address of the variable locationptr or the value address to what locationptr is pointing to that locationptr holds if it is the latter can someone push me in the right direction on how to check if it fits under the clause im not really sure what to do since comparing a pointertochar with a pointertomatrix would produce undefined behavior thanks
student,im really confused about the string initialization for example when i do ptrarray abc the terminal requires the index in array specified when i do ptrarray10000 abc the terminal says invalid conversion from const char to char
student,when doing functions like matrixrowmatrixcolumn when we are returning the row and column do they start at 0 or 1 so like is position 00 row 0 and column 0 or row 1 and column 1
student,in order to implement this function do i have to first initialize the array in the matrix struct
student,so my partner and i understand that to dereference a pointer and get the value at that location you would use ptr vs ptr which would give you the address for some reason when we do ptr we get an invalid operands to binary expression error when we cout ptr we get the addresses so we know it works i guess the question is what does the error mean and what can we do to fix it
student,is it cool to use traversal by index in p3 or is it pointer arithmetic only also is indexing even possible given the struct format were given would the location of the top left char be array00
student,for matrixsearchrandom in the rme it says eecs280randint exactly twice once for row and once for the column is the restriction that for each cell we should call it twice or that the whole function can only call it twice
student,are the content inside these two functions are actually the same but just call different kind of matrix ptr also im confused the const before the function does it mean that the function itself is not allowed to be changed
student,how do we check if a matrix is null or not im unsure of which parameters we are checking to be able to tell
student,is it possible in c to conditionally load libraries and header files for example iffoo include vector declare and use a bunch of vectors
student,i am confused with the matrixat function is the matrix being pointed to by ptr being stored in the arr or as an array thanks
student,when it it says that we have to test the requires clause with assert do we do that in the matrixtestscpp why are we testing for cases that go outside the requires clause
student,i am a bit confused on what the output for matrixrangeradius is does it print out everything in the rme example starting from src to destsize or does it just print the string of xs and 0s as in 0xx00x 0x thanks
student,since getrandint31 takes in no input values im just confused on how the function knows what the boundaries are to generate the random value
student,hello so im still slightly actually quite confused on how to get started on project 3 im starting on the utilcpp and the concept of putting something on debug mode and doing things on the terminal is still very hazy for me are there any resourcesinsightsanything that could help steer me in the right direction thanks
student,i understand that the matrix that we are dealing with is a 2d array i would like to know what the addresses look like for a 2d array ex for a 23 2 row and 3 column matrix oxo ox1 ox2 ox2 ox4 ox5 my question pertains to the matrixrow function in matrixcpp i understand that the locationptr pointer is an address of some block of a matrix i dont understand how you could know the row or column number if the only information you have is the address of some specific row or column
student,hello everytime i try to use the gdb module on matrixcpp i get this error thanks
student,i am applying for a job which requires a project to be done i can code in whatever language and i am choosing c and using xcode i must use the restful api in my code to get it to work the spec specifies the exact code i must call for the api i have no idea how to do it i see theres a lot of http get and post requests if that info helps my program will have to take the data the api calls give to me and my program must modify it i watched the bs 20 minute video on their website explaining what restful does but that got me no closer help so lost
student,hello while testing matrixradiusrange i get an interesting result when printing out my resultant dest why do i get nonsensible characters thanks
student,i wrote a function to initialize the array of a matrix it takes a pointer to a matrix and the number of rowscols the specs say to declare all helper functions as static functions im wondering 2 things 1 is the function that i wrote a helper function it doesnt help any of the other functions and isnt called by any functions besides main 2 if it is a helper function and therefore must be static how can i call it in matrixtestcpp and schellingcpp without copy pasting code
student,would it make sense to use visual studio for this project if yes what kind of project type would it be thanks
student,so when we read in the dimensions r x c as a string are we allowed to break it up into row and column using string methods or do we have to convert that to a c string and then work with it
student,is there lecture today at 3 or is it cancelled
student,the effects clause of matrixrangeradius says that it returns a range of items within a rectangular radius however matrixrangeradius is a void function so it cant return anything are we just supposed to print the result to stdout
student,when we get our grades for exam 1 will they be raw scores or curved scores
student,i am having a little bit of trouble figuring out how the matrices in project 3 are stored in 1d arrays for example how would i access the ij element if the matrix is technically just a row vector
student,i know if you do return its not tail recursive but if you did return could it potentially be tail
student,why do we have to close files after were done reading them with an ifstream ex ifstream infilemyfiletxt string s infile s infileclose why is this necessary doesnt the ifstream destructor automatically close myfiletxt after infile goes out of scope
student,any helpful tips
student,is fxb the bagnoud francoisxavier building
student,
student,i was working through the winter 2015 exam and i solved problem 4 fold without using all the functions that i could have used like treesum is that okay on the exam
student,will there be a grading scale for the midterm and if so when can we expect to see it
student,for the first question in 1a i remember that when a vectoror array is created or passed by reference in a function then this function will not be tail recursive because of the destructor however after i type it into labster it told me that it is tail recursive so i am kind of confused if this function is nontail recursive
student,for 1d of winter 2015 the question says that speak does not modify any member variables how would you show this in the function declaration
student,if there is an array of struct object eg llamas what is the preferred way to access a member variable of one of the objects in the array i wrote a little code and found that array style indexing was only compatible with the operator and pointer style indexing only worked with the ie cout llamasiname works but cout llamasiname doesnt and cout llamas 1name works but cout llamas 1name doesnt this confuses me because an array is a pointer i didnt expect to be able to use to operator to access the member variables of arrays of structs at all does c just prefer llamasiname or am i misunderstanding something
student,we wouldnt be deducted points if our code for a function was really inefficient did something like check a base case more than once say in a function and its corresponding helper function as long as it generates the correct output right thanks
student,does this code result in an error because addthreeint39 passes a value to addthree whose parameter is t
student,hello i was just wondering whether there is a preference for checking the requires clauses on the written portion on the exam since in some cases on the practice exams we were told to check it and in some cases we dont need to thanks
student,will abstract data types be covered on the exam i dont see where they might have been covered in the eecs 280 lectures but i heard from two classmates that they have been covered its a given that structs and classes are fair game thats not what im asking about thanks
student,is there a difference between int compint int and int comptintint
student,is there any late submissions for labs i assumed that there werent but wanted to check just in case because i didnt see any specific policies about it in the syllabus thanks
student,if i had the code class triangle public double a b c triangle a 0 b 0 c0 triangle double ain double bin double cin a ain b bin c cin int main const int size 3 triangle trianglessize code here how would set each value of abc for different triangles in the array if i wanted to set the triangle in triangles at element 0 to have a 3 b 4 c 5 would the following code work and if i wanted to change the triangle at element 1 in triangles i would just increment the pointer t by 1 t triangles t triangle 3 4 5
student,im looking over the treedepth function from the powerpoint on recursion function pointers and testing and im not completely understanding how it works i get how you want to recursively check the left and write side of the trees but how exactly is it keeping track of the layers int l treedepthtreelefttree int r treedepthtreerighttree return 1 maxlr it seems like the 1 is adding up for each call but the maxlris confusing me what is max in this case exactly
student,will there be questions on the exam that require you to specifically know about project 3 or was it recommended that we start it to get experience with structs
student,for the function treet foldtreet tree int level do we need a function like treedepth to find the depth of the tree i dont know how i can stop the recursion of a tree at a certain level without a number to compare the level with if that makes sense
student,just want to see if im on the right track with this array of bools for making sure llama prints only once if a best friend is printed can i do llamasibestfriend llamas and set that corresponding location in the bool array to true the best friend is definitely going to be within the array of llamas given right
student,if we have int const x 2 int const const cptr x how do i declare a pointer to cptr int const const ptr cptr this line
student,the lab05 manual says all the starter code should work out of the box so make sure you are able to compile and run it but when i compile the starter code i get errors since bool findwordstring word and string getuserword dont return anything is this a mistake in the lab
student,can someone please explain to me why this wont work int a 1234 int ptr a cout ptr endl but this does work int a 1234 int ptr a cout ptr endl
student,im in james class and he didnt cover the materials about class however i found class is covered by professor deorio so here i wonder does class gonna be tested in our midterm
student,w15 problem 5a what is the syntax for initializing deptptrs students array i thought deptstudents studentsin would work because deptstudents points to an array therefore is an address in memory and studentsin is also an array what am i doing wrong
student,how does this work double var4int i take it that there are two functions the outer one that takes an int and returns a double and the inner that takes nothing what does the inner one return also whats the difference between var4 and var4 what doe the parenthesis around the pointer do
student,im wondering whether treeprintouterleft is recursive nothing happens after it in the function which makes me think it is but the return doesnt happen immediately after it which makes me think it isnt
student,is char str6 h e l l o 0 the same as char str6 hello
student,i wanted to test my answer and wrote the following code int stringlengthhelperconst char const s const int length if s return length return stringlengthhelpers 1 length 1 int stringlengthconst char const s return stringlengthhelpers0 int main char c4 rob 0 const char ptr c cout stringlengthptr endl when i run it i get a segmentation fault what is causing this error thanks
student,what would be the base case for the recursion
student,can someone explain to me why the third part of question 1 part a is recursive but not tail recursive i dont see how there is work being done after the last recursive call to hannoi
student,if i have a function where im traversing by pointer through an arraycstring is it correct that it is a good idea to create a new pointer and initialize it to be equal to the pointer passed in as an argument rather than increment and therefore change the value of the argument pointer if i need to use the argument pointer for comparison or pointer arithmetic like in the strlen function and not necessary otherwise specifically my implementation of strchr from the midterm review declares a new pointer and uses it to traverse the cstring while professor deorios implementation increments the pointer passed in as an argument representing the cstring so my question is are there any other cases where it would be necessary to use a new pointer
student,this is a function from the lecture slide int log2int x if x 1 return 0 return 1 log2x2 not tail recursive im wondering if i changed the function to int log2int x if x 1 return 0 log2x2 return log2x2 would this be tail recursive
student,when returning null for a function that returns a pointer should we say return null or return 0 is these terms equivalent if so is there proper syntax
student,hello i ran this code with lines 13 and lines 23 commented out and the output at the bottom right was shown however when i uncommented those two lines the code wont compile and im not sure why why doesnt s just act as a pointer im not sure why i cant just increment the array name itself because it is just a pointer isnt it also line 23 wont compile as well and it says that the value couldnt be changed by a string literal even though i havent declared a const anywhere does it have something to do with the warning in line 21 that reads iso c doesnt allow conversion from string literal to char thanks in advance
student,for spring term 1b is code still outputted even though when i 4 inputchars4 is the null termination character 0
student,when you are trying to initialize an array of pointers in a struct to a given array of pointers would either of these be an appropriate method while looping through the array structpointerarrayi arrayini or structpointerarrayi arrayini
student,where does the int length element come from when you are only bringing in a pointer to an array i can make it work when i initialize a length variable to be 0 in the main function but i dont believe this is allowed seeing as there is no space for it am i missing something blatantly obvious
student,are we allowed to bring scratch paper for the exam
student,the online lecture for professor deorios lecture 9 have very poor resolution and are pretty much unreadable in the google drive there are lecture slides but they are missing the slides with the blue background which contain the answers and explanations to the examples is there any way we can gain access to these slides it would be very helpful for midterm studying
student,for both of these would we reference the element a in the triangle t by ta
student,if you know the length of the cstring would you still use a while loop or a for loop eg bool ispalindrome const char str int len char j str len for char i str i str len i if i j return false j 1 return true is this correct or should i use a while loop instead
student,slides lt8 page 13 there is a sentence that don’t try to print a char not pointing into a cstyle string any example that a char not pointing into a cstyle string
student,could anyone offer a hint on printing each llama just once
student,i know the fact that if simply return foo the function should definitely be tail recursive im wondering if the following code is tail recursive thx int foo int r foo return r
student,for the exam will we have to know the difference between using x and x
student,because argv is an array of char pointers if you dereference argv once you would get the address of what the first element is pointing to correct and if you dereference it once again you would get the first element of the cstring that the first element in argv is pointing to right thanks in advance
student,other than syntax is there any difference between passbyreference and passbypointer does the compiler convert one to the other or are these inherently different
student,i have gone through all the examples of recursion with tree problems from the project and the sample exams however i still dont understand how to efficiently and quickly solve tree problems on an exam when time is so limited what is the correct thought process for tackling tree problems given the limited time we will have on the exam
student,
student,in practice exam we saw void printfriendshipsconst llama llamas blah blah in which llamas was an array of constant structs then what would be the syntax for a pointer to an array of structs like below const llama llamas llamasptr so that i would use it like below llamasptrllamasibestfriend llamasptrllamasiname
student,if i want to access an array member variable of a struct using a pointer to that struct do i use the same notation as i would if i were trying to access any other type int string etc for example struct somestruct int x int somearray and then in my main function say i have somestruct s sx ssomearray is this correct
student,do pointerstocharacterarrays char necessarily create cstrings
student,from lecture 7 slides arr gives you a pointer to the whole array type arr is int 5 a pointer to an array of 5 ints not the same as turning into a pointer of the first element cout arr 0x804240c0 cout arr 0x804240c0 the printed address is the same in practice how are arr and arr any different how can arr be used or how is it constricted to modify the array
student,am i correct in assuming that for ij i j­2 kij would be the equivalent of while i j code i j j 2 k i j in that order thanks
student,char str hello str str 1 is my cstring now ello
student,can continue be used within an if statement according to a few sources continue is only used in loops but it was used in an if statement in one of the solutions
student,in the review session the solution given for the printfriendship function included checking whether the current llama was already printed however nowhere in the rme for that function does it say to only print the current llamas friendship status only if it hasnt already been printed before so why do we have to check whether the current llama has already been printed
student,what is the difference between const int ptr x and int const ptr x
student,what was the declaration to the mystery function that we were supposed to find out during the activity portion
student,when i run make test i get the following error because argv2 is not a file in 1172 it was said that only d or a fileinputsin something like that would occupy argv1 or 2 given this what do i do about this error when i run make test error schelling d schellingdebugout error opening d make test error 1
student,hi my schellingcpp looks like it works as it passed the schellingdefaultstestdebugoutcorrect schellingdefaultstestoutcorrect and testdriverrandommodein on the diff checker but when i test it against testdriverfilemodein i still get the same matrix as in the above 3 cases with 8 iterations instead of 2 i cant seem to find any bugs in my code so can someone tell me how to deal with this also testdriverfilemodeoutcorrect only prints out the satisfactionratio and size while the other outcorrect files print out more details like percentx and percento is this intentional because as of now i have to change my cout statements to adjust depending on what file im checking against thanks
student,w15 5d part 1 when passing the course that we have created to the course initializer function do we need to use a reference operator in order to pass an address of the newcourse to the initializer
student,hi i just want to confirm whether i got the right answer for this part for the first box 5 second box 0 thanks
student,will partial credit be given on the exam for example if you were to write a function that has 2 effects but you only do 1 of them will credit be given for that 1 effect
student,will this be covered on the midterm it is not in the practice midterm
student,ive read the lecture notes several times ive been going to lecture and i rewatched the part of the video i saw relating to const although i didnt find much in the lecture recording on this topic i looked in the book and im still confused on how const works heres my current understanding and can someone please correct me if im wrong or if im missing something if i have a void function that takes a constant pointer to a character array so const char ptr some c string then im allowed to change ptr so that it points to a different address for an element in the array the only thing i cant do is change the value of ptr
student,i think im starting to understand it but im still having some trouble if someone could show me a brief example of how void courseinit would be written then that would be extremely helpful the main trouble im having is probably something really basic and simple in the example of courseinit i understand that its being given the input of the name of a course and then the credit hours i really dont understand what the deal is with course course if someone could help explain that would be awesome
student,i am having trouble implementing midterm stretch on labster im thinking that we probably need a nested for loop to add the the copies of each letter and then move on and add the copies of the next letters but im unsure how to actually code it
student,hi in the lecture slides for c strings i think its lecture 8 slide 12 had this code const char str hello my question is how are you assigning a stringliteralarrayofchars to a pointer dont pointers only take input if its an address thanks
student,for problem 5 on spring 15 i am trying to 1 figure out whether the value of the best friend pointer is 0 meaning there are no best friends 2 find out who the best friend is if there is a best friend is is possible to do something like llamasibestfriend 0 or llamasibestfriend to figure out the best friend if theres no best friend as in i know bestfriend is a pointer and i want to figure out where the pointer points to i wasnt sure if the a b arrow syntax should somehow be used here
student,i know we cant be told about whats on the exam but is it fair to assume that since we spent maybe 20 minutes in lecture at least juets lecture that we shouldnt worry too much about that topic at least in comparison to cstrings recursion and pointers
student,is a null matrix one with 0 rows and 0 columns or one of any size which does not contain any elements is the size of a matrix the amount of locations in it or the amount of elements in it in other words when counting the number of items in a matrix for matrixsize are empty spaces counted as items
student,where can i find a listing of office hours
student,im trying to review some of prof deorios examples for structs in the lecture recordings since those are slides that arent posted in the pdfs but the resolution of the video is incredibly low i cant figure out what the slides read is there a way to fix the resolution
student,i saw a post already about this question but it didnt fully answer my issue so int ptr array1 9 is assigned to the last spot in array1 then in the loop it says ptr ptr ptr wouldnt that cause it to go outside of the array also as you go through the loop wouldnt that also cause the pointer to leave the array
student,i want to check my answers for the labster practice problems for the midtermpointers function did anyone else get a 1 b 3 c 7 d 9 please let me know
student,in the lab writeup it seems to indicate that the getuserword function should be able to accept an empty string as input i tried to implement this function just with cin but cin will not detect an empty string and will keep waiting for input any advice on how to alter this so i am able to accept an empty string and a single word
student,ive tested this out in code and im a little confused so say i wrote something like this in labster char str16 hello char ptr1 str1 int arr3 1 2 3 int ptr2 arr ive understood that cout arr endl will give me the address of the first element in array and that the same thing will happen if i cout ptr2 and if i cout ptr2 then in this case i will get 1 so then it makes sense to me that cout ptr1 will give me in this case h now when i cout ptr1 i get hello and this is suddenly very confusing to me why dont i get an address or collection of address numbers instead
student,int a5 12345 int b a i know that b returns the address for a1 my question is does b also return the same address or can i only do x for actual values and not addresses
student,should the circled character have that little slash through it to indicate that its a zero thanks
student,hi im finding that prefer writing my code on lined paper rather than the large blank space provided on the exams is it acceptable to write my code on a lined piece of paper i bring in and then staple that paper in with the rest of the midterm thanks
student,i believe professor juett only covered structs whereas professor deorio covered both classes and structs will classes be on the exam
student,how do you do the llamas one
student,im wondering what the differences between student studentsmaxstudents and course coursesmaxcourses also if we want to access these two shall we use student students and course courses thank you
student,am i the only one not able to use the search bar o maybe o idk o no it wont work o yes youre crazy
student,what is the red part doing in this problem i am having trouble understanding what it even means
student,i dont understand why b is 5 and not 3 doesnt y point to 3 from the y and then print out dereferenced b which is pointer to y
student,in the void foo function will the last two statements x and y affect anything in int main i think that it would change the addresses of x and y in the foo scope but i am not sure if it would actually transfer back over to int main i guess what im asking is what does the last cout x y endl in int main print
student,when should we expect project 2 grades to be out need it to prepare for the midterm
student,i have a struct containing x and y members this initialization throws warning extended initializer lists only available with stdc11 coordinates j x y but this does not coordinate x y therefore is the following the only way to create a struct array coordinates j x x coordinates j y y
student,just a quick clarification but the matrixgrid is suppose to start at row 0 column 0 right and if you have a 3x3 matrixgrid the last position should be row 2 column 2
student,i am confused on the output on this one wouldnt array2 ptr array1 be a value outside of array 2 thanks
student,im having trouble visualizing how to traverse through this array of characters i imagine its probably similar to flip from lab 04 in the sense that you have to start at the beginning and compare to the end and keep moving towards the middle comparing the two values but i do not get the actual code that would allow this to happen i have attempted a solution but it causes a segfault so i am very confused any help would be great thanks
student,im not sure where to insert a const into the function parameters but im guessing it would go in bool studentcanaddcourse if i had to pick one could someone clarify and what exactly is meant by according to best practices
student,first the search function isnt working for me right now so im sorry if this has already been asked when you declare a const array why are you able to pass in nonconstant values what exactly is a const declaration doing is it its own type like a pointer or is it a modifier
student,where would you guys recommend finding more practice for the stuct problems i have gone through the problems on each exam but i am still not feeling confident in my ability to solve these kinds of problems
student,what are argv and argc is that something just used with the shell
student,in the powerpoint it says in the old days of the c language strings were originally represented as just an array of characters char str hello but isnt that still what a cstyle string is today
student,in the review session the instructor said that the following function is not tail recursive because result is being incremented and that it would be tail recursive if the was removed wouldnt it still not tail recursive because there is work to do between the recursive call and the return specifically assigning the result of foo to result
student,what exactly does this line mean int ptr2 ptr1 i noticed that when later in the program it does ptr2 1 ptr1 changes and im not sure why thanks
student,i heard from a friend that there is sample midterm exam available at the office is this true
student,are we required to move the agents to places where they are satisfied with their neighbors or are we supposed to move them somewhere completely random if the latter is the case wont the number of iterations be completely random
student,requires numrowsin maxnumrows and numrowsin 0 numcolumnsin maxnumcolumns and numcolumnsin 0 does this mean that the program will never need to handle a matrix of size larger than 99 rows by 99 columns and since the array is of size 100100 do we have 199 elements that are never officially needed
student,
student,im still a little bit fuzzy on structs and how exactly they work with pointers for 5d we are supposed to add newcourse to all of the students in eecsdept and im not really sure how exactly to access the array of students within the department do i declare a pointer that is equal to eecsdept and then have that point to the array of students and loop through all of them also is student studentsmaxstudents considered an array of pointers to structs i rewatched the lecture and im still confused about this
student,hi im kind of confused on how to find the file name we are writing in from i understand what is written on this post 1080 but when i test if argv1 d i get a compiler error about how i cant compare the literal to the argv1 is there another way i can do this also will we ever be given an outut file but not an input file or another argument that is not a file after d such as schelling fileout schelling d filein schelling something else schelling d something else or can we assume those will be the only things to occupy arg1 andor arg2 respectively
student,do we need to create separate test functions for every function in matrixcpp some of the smaller and more trivial functions such as matrixinit matrixsize etc can be tested together more efficiently can we combine and test them together in one test function
student,in the announcement with exam details it said the following the midterm will cover the following lectures 0009 labs 0105 projects 12 i was wondering when lab05 would be released if the midterm will actually cover lab05 thanks
student,is the answer pointer or pointer to an int
student,ive been struggling with slide right for ever i know what logic i want to use but i dont know how to apply it to traversal by pointers every implementation i try to come up with ends up being by index because anytime i try to change the value at the address the pointer is pointing to i end up with errors and i really dont know what to do ive also read like a billion piazza posts
student,the type of c string is char if i insert an 0 to an array with type int would it become a c string or it would not compile
student,i just need a clarification does the question wants us to remove all the nonunique numbers and sort all the unique numbers in ascending order or we do not have to care about whats after the unique sequence of numbers
student,a kind of offtopic question when declaring a char string hello using charindex syntax do we need to include the space for n and have to use at least char6 not char5 for that
student,i want to use a tail recursion for flip am i allowed to write another function and use it in flip to do this problem
student,which one is better to use in exam
student,for flip function while i am increasing pointer may i minus the value of n each round as it goes then if i do ptrn does that still fullfill the requirement
student,are the answerssolutions to the practice midterm posted anywhere if not will they
student,hi im struggling with 1e youre supposed to do a while loop that makes the output be persia wales beair egypt after reading in a file that says prince of persia prince of wales prince of belair prince of egypt we cant modify anything but the while loop and i have no idea to to get it to only print the countries also does the file read in as 1 big string or what or is each line a string thanks for the help
student,so ive watched and rewatched the lecture on how to properly read in information from a file but neither of the lectures address how to do this for different types or with error messages i attempted to use an if statement instead of a while loop if file value instead of while file value but that throws an error i dont see how i can do this can someone please point me in the right direction
student,just want to clarify something about pointer declarations int x int x int x the three above are the same right we are declaring x as a pointer to an int also i had a question about the slides on the midterm review there were a couple functions like this int find int a unsigned int size int search code here why would we declare this function as a function pointer in this situation
student,why is locationptr in matrixrow a const char how is a pointer to a char supposed to give a location
student,lets say hypothetically that a student is unable does not have the time to bus to north and wait in a long line to check on the solutionanswer to a singular past midterm question what would this student do to check their answers and make sure that they actually understand the content
student,im trying to figure out more specifically how pointers work looking at the example in the lab manual forint ptr arr ptr arr 5 ptr i am suddenly very confused ive tried messing around with a bunch of different things in c as well as look back on lecture slides this is probably a stupid question but why isnt it written as ptr arr ptr
student,flip requires that the elements in an array are reversed in order i am using two pointers but when i set one pointer to another location that pointers original location gets lost i know that storing it in an int would not be possible because there could be a lot of elements in the array
student,for adding a course does the helper function return true if you are not at the max number of courses if so im having some trouble checking to see if the course slot in the array already has a course maybe im misinterpreting what numcourses is in the student struct but is it saying the student can have a valid max of that many courses or the student already has that many courses and we can just add to the index numcourses 1
student,does anyone have a suggestion for how to get started with removeduplicates not sure how to approach this one
student,say i have a while loop like whilei j where i and j are integers but i still access the elements of the array using pointers inside of this while loop does this count as traversal by pointer or does it only count if my conditions are also pointers
student,i have been kind of lost in lecture the past couple days and am now going back through the slides to try to understand how pointers and otherstuff post project 2 works i just want to clarify something because i actually just tried something from a lecture slide it was int x 3 int r x cout x endl cout r endl cout r endl cout x endl i then tried the same thing except i did int r x so does the not do anything but give r the same address as x
student,will the solutions to the midterm review lecture be posted
student,in the rme for matrixrangeradius what do mcenter and ncenter mean is it the row and column or what
student,since lab4 was through labster can we just submit this assignment through copy and pasting on ctools
student,im obviously messing something up when i set my pointer to the end of the array im off because an int is size 4 so instead of going to 0x1016 im going to 0x1020 and i dont know how to think of it differently
student,there seems to be no other way to do this problem
student,hey so today i was planning on finishing up the lab i had started and when i went to labster everything was gone not just my code but all the eecs 280 code and it wouldnt say if i was using maize or blue labster just labster is there an issue with labster today
student,are we allowed to bring colored pens to use for our scratch work
student,im struggling with the linear time aspect of the challenge it seems like we would need to check each value in the array against each of the values that precede it is that right if so how can this be done without a nested forloop i take it that nested forloops are the sort of thing that make a function nonlinear so theyre forbidden is that correct how else could i approach the problem
student,thanks james and vidal and jon and all the other staff that stopped by for rocking it out at the review session still going strong at 615am literally the best staff members ever see you at dennys i wasnt told to post this no not at all but seriously mad props okay so i was supposed to post this at 615 am but fun fact i cant tell the difference between 183 and 280s piazza after 16 plus hours of studying
student,i seem to be losing values when i do my implementation of this function it also says we cant use another array
student,hey when can we expect the autograder to be up also i dont know if this is a firefox problem or something new with the autograder but on linux i could not access the autograder when using firefox the browser you are using does not support web storage please try again in a different browser problem with firefox
student,printcstrbuffer buffersize 2
student,am i right about this so if i use 99 as the number of rows initialized into a matrix matrixnumrows will tell me there are 99 rows and size will be 99 or will numrows be 100 and size be 100
student,for the matrix functions the h files say we should check to see if the requires clauses are met using asserts does that mean we should simply accept the fact that the program will close if the assert is false or are we supposed to do something special if the assert is not true
student,im trying to test my utilcpp function using utiltests but im getting an error i use the following code to compile g wall werror utiltestscpp o utiltests however i get undefined reference error for all code within utiltestscpp referring to functions in utilh whats up with this
student,i was experimenting with printing pointers and noticed something odd the following block of code executes and prints success to the screen char c x char cp c cout cp endl assertcp x cout success endl however if i remove the cout line the assert fails am i changing the value of cp by not printing it char c x char cp c assertcp x cout success endl this line doesnt execute because the assert fails
student,are we allowed to do all of lab04 with array indexing i know some require pointer traversing but can i use array indexing within that
student,will we need to know how typedef works for this exam thanks
student,is there a better version of professor deorios lecture 9 mine is very blurry and i cannot make out the blue slides for studying additional question is this just my internet connection or is someone else having this problem
student,with our test cases are we allowed to use ptrarray3 and get its location to use as locationptr in the function testing matrixrow or is this considered traversal by array and cant be used even in a test case
student,every time i call the genrandint31 function it returns the same number why it is not a random number
student,when you initialize two variables one after the other can it be assumed the the two variables are placed into memory addresses adjacent to each other the reason i ask is because i typed up the code to this problem in xcode to see if it would quit with a segmentation fault but it doesnt the last two lines in the foo function x y seem to make the two memory pointers swap memory addresses and i wasnt sure if that was just lucky or if that is something that we can assume will always happen
student,where is the review session today
student,this applies to lab04 slideright flip and removeduplicates but is there a way to actually change index values using pointers alone i know theyre const int so im assuming not but when were supposed to use traversal by pointer can we still change arrays the way i usually did in the past like arri i and would that be considered traversing by pointer still
student,two questions about the matrixrangeradius inputs does rowcenter colcenter have to be inside the matrix for example if i have a 3x4 matrix could i called matrixrangeradius on it with rowcenter colcenter 43 and radius 2 0 1 2 3 0 x o o x 1 x o o 2 x o x 3 4 c where c 43 and in theory dest ox second can the radius be 0 if yes should a call with radius 0 make dest contain the single element at rowcenter colcenter or no elements at all
student,in the matrixh file the array is setted to 100100 but if the rows and columns are not 100 how can we assign the array
student,httpsxkcdcom371
student,im having some trouble with slideright from lab 04 i was thinking of assigning the first element of an array to a new variable and then doing something along the lines of i 1 i and then assigning i to the new variable but this doesnt seem to work is there some other approach that would be better thanks
student,12 hours from 2pm to 2 am is that real or 46 hours or 68 hours
student,char x6 hello char y x char z6 i want to make sure i understand the pointer concepts correctly so y will be the address of x0 how would i initialize z so that it is an array of 6 pointers each pointing to each x element when i visualize z in my head it would look like char z6 ptr to x0 ptr to x1 ptr to x2 ptr to x5 could something like z exist at all
student,why do structs have to be passed by pointerreference versus just by value ex void personbirthdayperson p vs void personbirthdayperson p main personbirthdayalex
student,is there any way to achieve something of this form where address is actually a copy of the numbers address rather than a pointer to it int number 1 int address number what about a copy of a pointers address without a double pointer int ptr number int ptraddress ptr i am assuming this is never possible because of a type mismatch but would like to make sure thanks
student,i am trying to figure out how to implement the flip function in lab 4 but stuck i understand how using two pointers would help but am still a little lost on the logic any hints
student,on this practice exam there is a question on templates which we have not covered so is safe to assume we wouldnt be responsible for a question involving them or am i missing something
student,i keep getting an error error invalid conversion from const char to char fpermissive char newpointer ptr array where ptr is the pointer to the matrix passed into the function and newpointer is a pointer i am trying to create that points to the first element of the array i understand i am getting this error because i want to get a regular pointer from a const pointer but i have no idea how to get around this thanks
student,are we supposed to use argv or other parameters for the main function in schellingcpp
student,i see we are supposed to copy our function for matrixat into the const version i also copied my test cases but i cannot figure out how to edit them so i call the const version of matrixat without acciddently calling the other one i keep getting the following error when i am initializing the number of rows and cols error invalid conversion from const matrix to matrix
student,matrixcpp12821 error multicharacter character constant werrormultichar while ptrarr 0 i was trying to iterate through a matrix array and i am getting this error i have include cstring include string
student,is the review today friday 2 pm until saturday 2 am or saturday 2 pm until sunday 2 am
student,is it possible to substitute assert for ifelse statements in the context of writing any program
student,hi when i am implementing the printarrarpointer function in lab4 the labster gives me a warn on this conversion however actually the cpp can be run on the labster but not on linux using g so im asking is it valid to convert a const int to a int
student,im getting a 500 error as im trying to access the class google page
student,in matrixcpp i was writing my functions but received this error matrix the struct was defined in matrixh do i need to cp this definition into matrixcpp i did include matrixh in my matrixtestscpp file
student,is it not allowed to use variable length length arrays in our code if it is not in a struct with the flags we are using
student,for doing slide right in lab 4 im doing the recommended method and starting at the end of the array and working backwards however i keep getting 40333 as my final result what im doing is using the pointer to assign the current value to the one before it is this not the correct method
student,if i want to access element 23 in a 5x5 matrix which element would that be a b c d e e f g h i j k l m n o p q r s t u v w x thanks
student,i know the blue sides on prof deorieos lectures are not posted on the google drive the quality is so bad that i cant even make out what they are is there a possible way we can obtain those
student,if eecs280randprobability is supposed to return a value between 0 and 1 inclusive how do the tests in utiltests make sense specifically these double epsilon 0001 asserteecs280randprobability 0278498 epsilon asserteecs280randprobability 0188382 epsilon asserteecs280randprobability 0546882 epsilon wouldnt these fail the majority of the time
student,im assuming that the 1d array holds the elements of the 2d matrix by rows so for example in a 4 by 4 matrix the first 4 elements of the array are the first row of the matrix the next 4 elements of the array are the second row of the matrix and so on is that right
student,im rewatching the lecture about arrays and pointers and deorio does an example where int x 3 int r x cout x cout r cout x cout r im not entirely sure what the take home message for pass by reference is is r the same as x essentially if you said r 10 then would x and r both be 10
student,for matrixsize do we just return the number of rows number of columns or do we return the exact number of filled up spaces in the array
student,after reading the specs it seems to me that there are 4 combinations of command line arguments that our main function should be able to take schelling default schelling d same as default with debug mode enabled schelling filein initialize a matrix from a file schelling d filein enable debug mode and initialize a matrix from a file should main be able to handle random input as well something like schelling hello and what about the order of arguments should main be able to take schelling filein d thanks
student,i was wondering how to traverse by pointer when the printarraypointer is in terms of const int do i get rid of the const im not sure how to traverse if cannot point
student,the lecture recording of todays lecture is not clear does anyone has the same problem
student,im writing the function for this lab but i am really stuck about how to get started i cant really figure out how to change the elements of the array without deleting the ones i need to move over in the process any suggestions
student,hi is todays lecture relevant to the exam and or p3
student,for some matrix rowcolumn am i allowed to delete elements in the array by rewriting elements by shifting them 1 place to the left
student,i am getting the following error that is preventing me from compiling how do i fix it
student,from lecture slide const int size 3 triangle trianglessize triangles0a 3 triangles0b 4 triangles0c 5 triangles1a 5 triangles1b 12 triangles1c 13 triangles2a 8 triangles2b 15 triangles2c 17 i am attempting to iterate through the array triangles of type triangle and printing out the value of each member in the struct for triangle t triangles t triangles 3 t cout trianglesta endl cout trianglestb endl cout trianglestc endl cout endl i am getting an error message because the index t cant be used in cout trialgesta endl how should i proceed
student,what size is our cheat sheet allowed to be also what is the last lecture to be covered on the exam todays
student,assuming the array has assigned values
student,what if you wanted to pointed to an actual char rather than an array of chars arrays of chars are cstyle strings right wouldnt char string be a pointertochar i understand that string is equivalent to a pointer to the array of string so wouldnt char string be the way to declare an array of pointertoints im not sure how char string becomes char string for argv because im thinking that this would instead be a pointer to a pointertochar and im not sure what the correct way of thinking is thanks
student,should we start from zeroor one
student,i looked at the matrix declaration and it has arraymax rowsmax columns in it so can i just access the ith row and the jth column by doing arrayij
student,when i write ptrarray0 1 cout ptrarray1 endl i get this weird little box of numbers as output instead of the integer 1 that i was expecting anyone know whats going on
student,hi can someone explain why the destsize parameter is a pointertoint instead o an int in the example in the updated rme you update destsize by doing destsize 9 so was this a typo or am i missing out on something thanks
student,ptrnumcolumns i am confused about the matrix syntax for this project and this seems to be the only way i can get it to compile
student,in order for it to compile properly the following changes must be made adding includeiostream at the top of the file replacing cout and endl with stdcout and stdendl respectively when lab 4 gets graded what platform will it be runtested on should i remove these changes when submitting
student,ok so im familiar with the gdb debugger weve used in lab i also know from a quick google search that we can use the compiler flag dglibcxxdebug to use the debugging version of libraries like vector etc but im not sure what the project spec is referring to when it talks about debugging mode i thought that debugging stuff was roughly something applied to code and not something that we can access inside our code i dont think this was ever discussed in class or in lab am i missing something thanks
student,why is it not required that row number of rows in matrix and col number of columns in matrix if that is not required and it turns out to be the case when testing the function what output should be have effects returns a pointer to item at location rowcol requires row 0 and row matrix number of rows col 0 and col matrix number of columns ptr points to a nonnull matrix you must check the requires clause using assert char matrixatmatrix ptr int row int col
student,does the first line of file is important mode file do we need to assign file or random into a variable or just omit that line
student,when i try and run my lab 04 i get this message it looks like youre trying to see which pointer comes beforeafter in memory but this only makes sense if both pointers come from the same array i dont think thats the case here i understand what it is saying but in my function i am calling i i 1 for the pointer and i am almost positive they point to the same array is this not the proper way of calling a pointer thanks
student,
student,does the address of locationptr need to be within the 10000 allocated spots in the char or do we check that locationptr is within the char arrays filled in elements
student,will the radius always be 1 for the matrix range function it has radius as a parameter but every example just had radius as 1
student,can someone clarify the difference between a null matrix and an empty matrix thanks
student,does the pointer to matrix point to the element in the first row and first column like a pointer to array points to the first element in the array
student,for the functions involving getting the matrix size row and column size and matrixinit can we create a copy of the passed in matrix and return its size also for matrixinit can we create a new matrix and have ptr newmatrix and then initialize the row and col size of this new matrix
student,i dont understand how we can modify an array and get an array that is a recombination of the elements in the original array using traversal by pointer dont we change the elements of the array as we go so how do we get to use the original array if it is continuously being modified
student,what does it mean to remember if debug mode is enabled im assuming that we create a global static bool variable then create a pointer to it and use it in the set and get debug modes to set and get its value is that right
student,why am i getting this error when i try to compile
student,
student,in the spec it asks us to exit nonzero if any of these tests fail top of page 4 so why is our upper bound on rows and columns 10 inclusive here but in matrixh our maxnumrows 100 and maxnumcols 100 which is the correct max number of rows and columns
student,so i would like to clarify a few things matrix matrix matrix pointer matrix matrixinitpointer 4 4 creates a matrix with four rows and four columns like so x o o o o o o o o o o o o o j o however it looks from the public tests that we use indexing starting at 0 which would mean that matrixatpointer 0 0 returns a pointer that has the value x char jpointer matrixatpointer 3 2 returns a pointer that has the value j matrixrowpointer jpointer would return 3 matrixcolpointer jpointer would return 2 can anyone verify this for me thank you
student,in this slide of the arrayspointers lecture why would y crash instead of printing out 13 in addition in the second cout statement why would y print out 42 instead of 13 i know that y x stores xs address in y but wouldnt y stay the same just a bit confused thanks
student,why is numrowsin required to be less than maxnumrows instead of less than or equal to
student,i just want to confirm that i have this down in the below matrix is the percent symbol located at 2 1 or at 1 0
student,i am very confused as to what i am supposed to do and how i am supposed to write utilcpp what functions have we learned that allow me to access whether or not we are in debug mode
student,my partner and i do not understand the second hint about getting a smaller number from a big random integer using the operator our understanding was that the call to genrandint31 already returned the integer we wanted so why need the
student,i was just thinking about the placement of the and operators and was wondering if the following was true int x y is this the same as int x y int x y is this the same as int x y
student,this is the rme for matrixsize effects returns the total number of items in the matrix requires ptr points to a nonnull matrix are items just the xs and os or do they also include blank spaces im a little confused because the spec refers to the xs and os as agents and has no mention of items
student,when will the prelab survey be released for lab 4 also i assume our links will be emailed to us
student,are there any resources that allow two users to share and edit a file for coding purposes much like google drive using google drive can be a pain if the two partners want to work on the project at the same time thanks
student,how do i do this all at once i click the ctools link for google drive but i cant seem to add all of this into the google drive at once but manually add every folder thanks
student,how do we know what address the locationptr is pointing to given that its a pointer to a const char
student,i type make test into the terminal and i get the error message no rule to make target utilcpp needed by utiltests stop i understand that it thinks there is nothing called test in the makefile but ive tried all the commands from the makefile all of them give me the same error and i am in the correct directory how do i fix this
student,after reading through the specs for project 3 i got the impression that the code would be able to run some processes before i wrote any code by using the schelling command described in the specs i tried this command as well as all of the make commands in makefile in both my terminal and a caen shell each time i did this i was given a message saying either schelling no such file or directory or no rule to make target schellingcpp needed by schelling stop im a little confused because if i remember correctly the starter code for the past 2 projects ran out of the box i just want to make sure nothing is missing or buggy on my end before i start coding thanks
student,hi the rmes for matrixat says row 0 and row matrix num rows col 0 and col matrix num columns but i thought row and column couldnt be 0 so can someone explain why it isnt row 0 and row matrix num rows col 0 and col matrix num rows thanks
student,i cannot find the syntax for how to set values to the matrix at certain coordinates thanks
student,what is the difference between declaring a variable as static vs const
student,aside from writing the test cases first which file would you guys recommend starting first schelling matrix or utils
student,the rme for matrixinit asks to check when initializing and exit via assert if the matrix columnrow are greater than 1000 or less than 0 however in your test case for in matrixtestcpp a 0 x 0 matrix is initialized and then tries to assert to check that the matrix size is equal to 0 however wouldnt the code have already stopped running at that point im not sure if i am overlooking something silly or not understanding the rmes properly
student,how are we supposed to check the output of matrixprint using assert or are we required to
student,hello i plan to completely stop working on project 3 sometime later this week in order to completely focus my time and attention on preparing for the exam is this recommended and if so how much time before next wednesday 1014 should i spend on preparing for the exam thanks
student,hi just wondering are the grades or completion of the labs listed somewhere
student,seems kind of odd to me
student,hello for matrixinit i am trying to set up the column numbers in and the row numbers in like an array but i get errors since it is a void function do we just assert and thats it also since the size of the matrix is set up like this char arraymaxnumrows maxnumcolumns how should we access its elements with ctype arrays thanks
student,hi i wasnt sure where im supposed to include the mt19973h file its not mentioned at all in the spec and i assumed that i should include in utilcpp but i wasnt sure if including it in other files would be problematic thanks
student,should the columns and rows start from 0 or 1 why is this element at 2 3
student,are we given the option to submit lab 3 by simply copyingpasting our code into the assignment box on ctools like in lab 2 or should we submit the file thanks
student,this might be kind of a pedantic question but is there a reason why matrixcpp is capitalized while schellingcpp and utilcpp are not
student,hi im confused by the functions matrixrowmatrixcol we didnt need have to implement and function to actually add values into the array so i dont know how to write these functions also the comments in matrixh says that it stores a 2d matrix in a 1d array can someone explain to me how this is done thanks
student,i noticed that in the file schellingdefaultstestdebugoutcorrect all the output of eecs280randprobability function have three digits after decimal point as precision except this line debug eecs280randprobability 00975 is this inconsistency intentional
student,where can i find the link to it
student,how do you unzip tar files
student,
student,just want to confirm when you perform map to array 1 array 2 modified is produced now array 2 modified array1 is passed to produce array 3 and so on please let me know if this is how the program is supposed to work thanks
student,i finished the first task map of the lab however when i tried to compile my code it just kept saying no such file or directory i used the compile code provided by the project 3 pdf file i wonder what mistake ive made and how to compile my code
student,when we declare a pointer is there any substantial difference between these two procedures int paul 21 int melissa melissa paul and int paul 21 int melissa melissa paul what difference does it make to use an ampersand in the first scenario thanks
student,i know how to traverse the array and change the values of the new array but im having trouble using the intmodifier type and add mult etc to do this what should i be doing differently
student,i am having a lot of trouble figuring out what is going wrong in my lab 3 i am trying to set the pointer destination array equal to the pointer source array which has the function applied to it through looping but the arrays all show up as 0000 any ideas on what im doing wrong
student,why can i not initialize a pointer to point to the end of an array when i try to do so i get an error saying that there is no matching function call to end here is how im doing it int ptrend endarr why doesnt that work
student,im wondering when will lecture cover all the materials needed for project 3
student,in the last example in the picture attached there isnt any yellow shading below the underlined center habitant at least when displaying on my device i would think that there would be shading for an entire square of neighbors because the underlined habitant isnt located in a corner such that their neighborhood is a square but isnt displayed in the figure because the neighborhood ends and the shading is cut off is there some rule about neighborhoods that im missing or is the shading just omitted because the underlined inhabitant doesnt have any neighbors in that region of the otherwisesquare neighborhood eecs280ifc1wgy7lgwtpng
student,are we supposed to use pointers to complete this lab or is indexing arrays without using pointers ie use something like src2 just fine
student,
student,does its name automatically becomes a pointer pointing to the first value or the hole string
student,debug eecs280randint5 2 debug eecs280randint5 0 debug eecs280randint5 3 moved o from 02 to 03 as can be seen the left parenthesis seems to be missing is this intentional
student,when we define a new c string should we manually initialize the last char as 0 for example if we want a cstring which has length 9 should we do the following char10 str str9 0
student,
student,hi im working on the third project and for the matrixsearchrandommatrix ptr char c function i am confused as to what the purpose of the random generated integers are for are we to make 1 a function that randomnly chooses a cell in matrix that happens to be identical to c and returns the memory address of the random cell or 2 a function that replaces the value of the randomnly selected cell in matrix and returns the memory address of the random cell that has the new value 3 other thanks
student,sorry this may seem like a stupid question but can we use loops in the map function for lab 3 or must we make map a recursive function it is a void type function so i would imagine it does not need to return anything
student,tldr should we assume that src and dst have the same size and that said size is equal to length in lab03 the rmes for the map function are requires src points to an array of size length dst points to an array of size length modifies dst effects dst now contains the results of applying func to each element of src according to this src and dst could have a size larger than the passed in length or even have different sizes so long as both of their sizes are still greater than or equal to length the effects portion of the rme states that dst should contain the results of applying func to each element of src if src has a size larger than dst this wouldnt work without increasing the size of the latter array additionally even if the arrays are the same size if length is shorter than the size of the arrays should we still apply func to each element of src as effects would suggest or only to the number of elements specified by length
student,the rme for gcd requires that a and b are positive integers but the last test for fold calls fold with gcd on arr4 which has a 1 in it does this mean we need to write a check for negatives in our fold function
student,how can i download and unzip the project 3 files using the wget command
student,in the rme of the function matrixrangeradius we are asked to check that the dest is big enough to hold all items using assert however i think that the dest is only a pointer to an array and there is no way to retrieve the information of the array once it is turned into a pointer so how are we supposed to do that
student,here the given test is trying to initialize a matrix of size 0 but in the required clause of that function the row and column must be greater than 0
student,the makefile mentions matrixprinttest test utiltests matrixtests schelling matrixprinttest utiltests matrixtests matrixprinttest matrixprinttestout diff q matrixprinttestout matrixprinttestoutcorrect but i cannot find matrixprinttestoutcorrect in any of the files on google drive does anyone know where it is
student,should we print debug eecs280randprobability numbern to cout for the function eecs280randint
student,will our p2testscpp be tested with a buggy p2cpp to see whether we caught all the errors
student,autograder is down
student,my partner and i cant get on the autograder right now is anyone else having issues
student,so i wrote my implementation for map for lab03 for some reason it keeps giving errors when i try to run it on sublimessh but when i put it through labster it works just fine i dont know am i doing something wrong
student,i seem to be getting failure for compilation when i submit what is the problem
student,httpswwwyoutubecomwatchvbbcnkjgqati just think while you been going down and out about the recursive functions of the world you could have been iterating with this slick code great music video about autograder
student,when i do my traversal test i get an error that says treeexception error tree empty what does this mean it takes me to a function in the binarytree file
student,
student,if a is and empty tree and b is 4 3 5 a is covered by b since b has empty trees is this true or not
student,how can i get my containedby function to output truefalse instead of 10
student,is it ok if i have multiple tests in one test function i added to testsumbasic and i have several scenarios that i am testing sumlist against i have several assert functions and several cout lines is this ok or do i have to make a new void function for every individual test scenario so i would have like 5 void functions all testing sumlist thanks
student,i get this error when i try and compile my test cases for chop
student,if you are passed in a list with no oddsevens for either of these functions would the function just return an empty list
student,i went through almost all of the posts regarding this and due to mixed responses im still unsure whether we need rme for helper functions someone please clarify
student,before the autograder was down i got 44 now im getting a 34 because im failing insert list but when i run my tests and the insert tree test provided to us i pass
student,im confused on the lab its asking to point array srs to another array with size length do i need to create a for loop that takes the reference of the array element and put it into another array
student,i have several ifdef statements for cleaner debugging of functions for example if traversaldebug is defined then the list will be printed at each iteration does this count as modifying the cout function seeing as the user needs to define the statement
student,is it supposed to be what it requires in order to be able to run or is it what is required for it to run and get the correct answer for instance if i have a helper function that counts something it will run but get the wrong answer if it is passed the wrong initial count does that mean it requires that count is 0 even if count changes on recursive calls
student,i understand that the traversal function should process left then the right tree but how can we process two trees when we have to have a return statement for example every time you recurse shouldnt all your stored data be wiped out in the function since those are local variables any tips on this function would be appreciated
student,hi ive been having trouble accessing the autograder i cant access it on firefox or chrome from linux ive been having this issue for a couple days firefoxs wont load at all and chrome is giving me an error this webpage is not available errconnectionrefused
student,is it necessary that we comment in the requirements and effects of each function in our cpp file or does the header file kinda already take care of this for us
student,
student,is the autograder down right now
student,should our test functions output pass or fail when it passes or fails respectively and exit the test functions at the point of failureusing assert or is one or the other ok
student,i am attempting to test my code with the gdb debugger but cant figure out the command line i need to write for it i remember it being something like g g p2cpp o filename but i am not entirely sure thanks for the help
student,are we also supposed to assume that tree a can be empty when writing the function
student,ive been trying to access the autograder but it says the page is not available is anyone else having this issue could just be my connection but i wanted to check here first
student,is it like 8 or midnight thanks
student,would you guys purposely pass in an empty list or tree even though it does not meet the requires clause im asking this so i know whether to check for that in my functions
student,my autograder is blank right now whenever i sign in i neither see project1 or project2 just a white screen please help
student,for my containedby and coveredby functions i end with an else statement that just returns true i use recursion to work my way through the branches i was just wondering if the function was still technically recursive if there is an else statement that just returns a bool at the end
student,hi suppose if youre missing a test case or if one of your function is not tailrecursive will you lose all points for those categories or is it just a tiny fraction if other functions match these requirements
student,i added my partners email but i dont see his email here is this supposed to happen
student,for example static void traversalhelpertreet tree listt list traversalhelpertree list
student,maybe tomorrow thanks
student,how many times per day may we submit project files to the autograder
student,when trying to insert 3 into the tree 2 1 4 i get the tree 2 1 4 3 which is the correct tree as a parameter just before my function returns the following tree 2 1 3 i am extremely confused and want to know if anyone else has had this problem and can point me in the right direction thanks
student,the autograder is giving a 01 for p2tests compilation check but its compiling just fine in caen linux and everything else is 11 any ideas on what this error means
student,has anyone seen this before i redownloaded the files binarytreeh and binarytreecpp but still get this error i have not altered the files at all
student,how can i run my test cases from my p2testscpp file in terminal
student,if were passed in an empty tree and the int 5 for inserttree should we return 5
student,im having trouble logging into my caen account for some reason ive tried turning the computer off and moving to a different one but the login screen is telling me that my password is wrong i think i would know my umich account password after three years so im a bit lost any ideas
student,some of my treemake functions are longer than 80 characters either of these ways acceptable style wise is one better than the other pretend theyd be over the 80 limit line if theyre on one line treemaketreefirsttree treemakeelt treemaketreerighttree treemaketreefirsttree treemaketreelefttree treemaketreerighttree or can i just not worry about the indents and have it continue on the next line something like this treemaketreefirsttree treemakeelt treemaketreerighttree thanks
student,when i am reconstructing the nodes i always return finally a tree without one of the first children ie 2 1 4 upon insertion i get back 2 4 3 is there a general rule of thumb that would be wise to heed with such a problem
student,when running maketest in caen i get this error filtertestcpptextstartup0x187 undefined reference to filterrecursivelist bool int collect2 error ld returned 1 exit status make filtertest error 1 i saw a post on piazza about this issue but the responses are just resolved with no indication of how it was resolved
student,if you worked with a partner on project 2 how do you make sure the graders know
student,so both today and tuesdays lecture focused on arrays addresses and reference types and stuff i am still really confused about what and actually entail do they have to be used together what do they actually changedo for example one of the slides on the lecture of a function was int findint a int size int search forint i a i rest of function what do the do much thanks for clarifications
student,i get compilation errors for both my files when i submit them to the autograder both files compile properly in other compilers and they also pass the public tests is something wring with the autograder or with my submission
student,when i ran the autograder i was successful in completing the first 3 tests however my code failed the p2tests compilation test even though it compiles and runs on caen does anyone know why or how that can happen
student,hi so ive read all of the inserttree posts and i still have no idea how to write this function i know im supposed to use traversal to order the tree into a list but i have no idea what to do from there bc of duplicate numbers and the fact that the list doesnt know the geometry of the tree i also have no idea how to rebuild the tree can anyone give me some tips
student,isnt whats being said in the specs below a contradiction talking mainly about the tree with the element 5
student,every time i copy and paste a list and makes the formatting look like this and its really annoying to reindent every time does anyone know how to avoid this
student,i am trying to write test cases for my inserttree function but when i input 0 or a negative number as the element the build will fail the rmes do not require that the element be a positive number should the function be able to handle negatives and 0
student,i have a sorted list from which i can create two binary trees list 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 tree 1 4 2 5 1 3 6 7 tree 2 4 2 6 1 3 5 7 is tree 1 not a wellformed sorted binary tree and if not why or what else im i missing here
student,ive read the definition multiple times and still am confused in this tree b 4 2 5 3 how is tree a 5 contained but not covered is it only because the roots are different
student,i didnt use listequal or treeequal in any of my functions and they all work was there a case in this project where we needed to use those or could we have done it without them
student,are we allowed use test helper function in p2cpp
student,can we just write the rmes of the helper function on top of each prototype or does it have to go with the function definition
student,if we have a partner for this project do both partners need to submit the same two files to the autograder
student,my accumulate function works when i test with sum but doesnt when i test with product as i step through it im seeing that it skips the call to accumulatehelper and just returns the value of result which is set to 0 why is this happening
student,i have a bit of code that i am separating onto two lines and im wondering if the computer still recognizes it as tail recursive for example i have something to the effect of finallist appendlistone finallist return finallist does this still count as tail recursive even though the program has to write the finallist into memory again before returning it thanks
student,for some reason i have no clue how to approach this function how would you make it so that it will go down the left and the right of the tree to compare values at the same time i did traversal but i dont know how to apply it here since containedby returns a bool
student,we are told no global variables but can we use them in our p2tests for testing purposes
student,given 4 2 1 3 which way would five be inserted 5 4 4 or 2 5 2 1 3 1 3
student,are there no surveys for lab 3
student,when i type in make test into the terminal i cannot compile this shows up tmpcc2xj53xo in function main simpletestcpptextstartup0xf7 undefined reference to reverserecursivelist simpletestcpptextstartup0x152 undefined reference to appendrecursivelist recursivelist collect2 error ld returned 1 exit status
student,if our list contains negative values it should still return whether they are even or odd right thats what i would guess based on what the spec says but i wanted to confirm
student,do we need to check if the binary tree inputted is sorted or are we only supposed to test sorted trees
student,it seems like theres more than one way to construct an ordered tree depending on which order they are inserted for example making a tree with element 1 and then doing inserttree2 treeup to 4 would produce this 1 2 3 4 while if you started with 1 and moved up to 4 youd end up with 4 3 2 1 both of these trees fit the definition of a wellmade ordered tree contain the same elements would return the same result to traversaltree and yet are two very different trees my concern is that if we were trying to construct a tree from a traversed list in inserttree it may produce a different tree from the original tree after certain insertions
student,are we considering the first term of the fibonacci sequence as 0 or is the 0th term supposed to be zero in other words does n start from 0 or 1
student,for p2cpp do we have to write an rme clause for every function even though they all exist in p2h
student,the isprime function provided in filtertestcpp doesnt work for the case of integer 0 and 1 i just inserted 0 and 1 into numbers and obviously isprime says they are prime do i just not worry about them
student,when we test treesum do our test trees have to be well sorted since were just returning an integer
student,is rotate supposed to be able to work with empty lists
student,im trying to use the latter version of treemake but it will not allow me to use empty trees as subtrees left right how do i properly use this function
student,hello in the test file were told to test all of our functions however both my sum and product functions use accumulate so when im testing them im testing accumulate within every capacity that i use it do i have to write a separate test function for it
student,can we pass an integer into append is an integer a form of a list thanks
student,ive written my inserttree function and it seems to work fine but i did not use the traversal function as indicated by the hint is it possible to write this function without traversal or is my solution incorrect
student,this might have been asked already but from what ive read from searching im still a little unsure for testing were supposed to use assert but we can also leave in print statements too right and for testing something like reverse for the list should we create a list that is the reverse of the list were trying to reverse and compare it to reverselist in the assert statement as far as style is concerned were just expected to meet what is in the style guide right i ended up just using one big main function in p2tests but commented out the different sections for the tests for each function so is that acceptable or will i lose points thanks
student,how do i insert an element to a tree because listmake creates a new tree
student,hi i transferred my files from my computer to linux on vnc via one drive and tried to make simpletest but it says clock skew detected your build may be incomplete im not sure what the problem is or how to resolve it but after a little research online it seems like it may be a timestamp issue for a file that weve changed
student,i have a conflict with the final exam and submitted the final exam conflict form when it came out how can i confirm that this got through and that i am all set for the makeup time i emailed kmcateeumichedu two days ago and still havent heard back
student,if i try to insert 2 into the following tree 2 1 3 can i even do this without violating the rules of the function
student,would we ever expect to have it ask if b is covered by a as in a 2 1 4 b 2 1 4 3 coveredbyb a because coveredby works for everything butttt that and there is nothing in contained by that says the trees passed to us have to be smaller covered by larger or vice versa but when i do it even though i have a seemingly sound base case i get an error on an empty tree
student,i feel pretty confident that my chop and chop helper functions are written correctly but now when i try to test it it goes into an endless loop i wrote the function very similar to my previous functions namely insertlist and rotate yet something has gone wrong
student,every time i try to remotely log into my caen account through vnc i am taken to a black screen the startup for the caen wont load and my pointer looks like an x whats going on with vnc
student,are we graded on style in our p2testscpp
student,should our functions in p2testscpp be static for safety i know our helper functions in p2cpp must be static
student,when writing an rme for a helper function do we need to include the statements declared for the original function for example requires x 0 effects gives example of x int examplefunctionint x requires x 0 effects gives example of x int examplefunctionhelperint x int y it seems like the rme would be almost the same for a helper function and if its called in the examplefunction then you already know what it would require and the effects from the rme for that function plus no one calls the function only the function it is helping so would there really need to be requires just looking for some clarification thanks
student,i used cout at first to check if the function gives correct output and it did but when i use assert the compiler would say stack overflow and wont go further what should i do
student,i know that we call coveredby in the contained function and we keep moving to different nodes to check if it is contained by but what is the base case in containedby
student,can we use int arrays in this project
student,the project specs say that empty trees are wellformed however we cannot insert new elements into the node of an empty tree how should we address this
student,what on earth is going on and how can i fix it
student,im having trouble using gdb on terminal when i type it in it says command not found it compiles fine on terminal but gdb wont work any suggestions
student,when you use assert to make sure that your output of either tree or list is correct how do you do this i know there is isequal functions that are written for us but then in reads in 2 lists or 2 trees i will have one list from the output of the function and how do we make expected list or tree also looking at recursivelistcpp are we supposed to test empty cases for sum and product i get 0 when i sum the empty list are we supposed to get error message saying empty tree or is 0 the right output thanks
student,can the coveredby function contain more parameters than the containedby
student,is the following a well sorted binary tree if not why thanks 1 2 2 3 4 5 6
student,i was wondering if the list created from traversal would be unique to the tree that the function was called on as in if traversaltree results in 12345 would there be only one unique tree that would make this list
student,what if the integer that we are to insert into the tree is already in the tree do we just not insert it do we have to account for this
student,is 4 5 contained by this tree 4 2 5 3
student,are treesum and traversal not supposed to have a requires clause all i have for them by default is effects returns the sum of all elements in the tree zero if the tree is empty int treesumtreet tree modifies effects returns the elements of tree in a list using an inorder traversal an inorder traversal yields a list with the left most element first then the secondleftmost and so on with the rightmost element last for example the tree 4 2 5 3 would return the list 2 3 4 5 an empty tree would print as listt traversaltreet tree
student,i get the following error when the make test command gets to the filter test filtertest 3 43 17 103 failed make test error 255 im confused as to what part of the filter function failed due to this output
student,i just realized that i dont need any extra parameters to see if a tree is covered but i feel like i would like more for checking if a tree contains a tree is it possible for the helper function to determine if something is contained and then the primary function to see if something is covered rather than the other way around
student,yesterday when i tried to compile i was only getting one error with a single line in a function which i have now figured out and corrected now when i try to compile i get errors for every one of my functions saying undefined reference to recursive list yesterday i was mainly trying to compile p2tests but if there was an error it would let me know when it called a certain function from p2 i am guessing that the error is most likely due to me forgetting to include something but i dont know what it would be in p2cpp i have include iostream and p2h am i missing something if not what could be the cause of my error
student,hello for the helper functions related to our tree functions and for the coveredby function do we declare those static as well thanks
student,to what extent are we expected to comment our p2tests file do we need to write rme clauses for our test functions
student,for the filter function when we do the recursive call do we have to call fn in some special way or can i just do return filterhelperlist fn
student,i dont completely understand what coveredby means does it mean that every new left subtree that is returned from treeb has the same top element as the new left subtree returned form treea and that both the left subtree and the right subtree of this new subtree cover the left and right subtrees of the subtree of treea for example if the following two trees are treeb and treea respectively does treeb not cover treea even though the initial left and right subtrees of b cover a 4 4 3 5 3 5 1 9
student,suppose that i currently have a tree like this 2 1 4 and wanted to treeinsert3 would i have to shift everything under 3 like this 2 1 3 4 or just kinda stick it onto the original like this 2 1 4 3
student,just to confirm we can debug our functions in labster right
student,although the spec says there is only one unique location for any element to be inserted into a tree what happens when the number that is inserted is equal to a leaf for example treet treea 4 2 7 inserttree2 treea which side should the additional 2 be placed
student,how do i disconnect from caen if i am using a commandline ssh connection
student,will shorter more elegant solutions receive higher grades for style than longer solutions i discovered errors in one of my functions and correcting it made it somewhat longer than it was originally the function appears to work correctly now will continue to test but should i try to make it shorter or is it acceptable that it works and has comments that explain it
student,hello i am recieving a compilation error for all of my files for project 2 on the autograder i am using the caen vnc and make test compiles and all test passed i have not change the header files so i am not exactly sure what is going on thanks
student,im not understanding this error in the accumulate function i am inputting two ints but this error keeps arising
student,im testing on my mac through terminal if i want to run a different test than p2tests for example treeinserttest what do i need to changeinclude other than p2tests at the end in this command g wall werror pedantic o2 p2testscpp p2cpp recursivelistcpp binarytreecpp recursivecpp testhelperscpp o p2tests since there are multiple files to include i want to make sure i have the correct ones when i change it thanks
student,when lists are presented as numbers separated by commas are they built right to left meaning listfirstexample 1 and listrestexample 2 then 3 then 4 or left to right meaning listfirstexample 4 and listrestexample 3 then 2 then 1 listt example 1 2 3 4
student,ive read through all the posts about the accumulate function and i want to make sure im understanding what im reading the accumulate function when passed in lista add 0 should return the same value as the sum function when passed in lista similarly the accumulate function when passed in lista multiply 1 should return the same value as the product function when passed in lista now to test the accumulate function in p2testscpp we should write our own add and multiply functions which we then pass into accumulate is that correct
student,is caen down or is the problem on my end
student,if treeinsert is empty do i just return a tree with just one element elt
student,if i apply listrest to a list of only 1 value will it return an empty list or the same list
student,i get an error message that pops up in the recursiveh file and highlights a line of code and says thread 1 excbadaccess code 2 address 0x7fff5f3ffff8 this error message appears in the recursivelist function and highlights what the line that says copyto do you know why this is or what this error means also i always get these threads messages when i compile why is this
student,i cannot figure out how to implement the traversal function i understand that you have to start out recursively going left but then i dont know how to go right from the current node and add it to the list
student,do we need to test the tree and see if its sorted or can we assume that the tree is sorted
student,are we allowed to have input in test case functionsthe example does not have input does not mean we cannot have inputs right
student,error ‘recursivelistrecursivelistconst recursivelistnode’ is private recursivelistconst node nodeptr i get this error when compiling does anyone know whats causing this
student,how can we check if both members were registered correctly i think we might have messed up the registration process
student,if there is only one element in the list what shall we return
student,im wondering if we are allowed to use testhelpers for this the treeequal function would be rather useful for containedby if we are allowed to otherwise im not sure how we would go about checking if two things are the same tree
student,when i compile using make test i get this error simpletest simpletestout binsh line 1 14863 segmentation fault simpletest simpletestout make test error 139 i was wondering if this just means that one of the tests in p2testscpp failed and also what exactly is getting put into simpletestout
student,so when we hit the bottom right or left side of the tree how can we go back to the top of the tree in order to go to the other side
student,can we have a helper function for filter
student,it seems like whenever i return something from a function that was called recursively my whole program returns that value and ends i expected it to return to the place in code it left off when the recursion was called but that isnt whats happening this is making it impossible to recursively traverse a tree because as soon as i get down a branch the program ends am i correct that returning should return to the place it was called not end the program im confused thanks
student,i am having issues trying to define my helper functions as static when i write this static int producthelperlist n do stuff int productlist n do stuff i keep getting the error message static declaration of producthelper follows nonstatic declaration
student,should we write rmes for the helper functions we declare in p2cpp for the style graders
student,when i go to compile my code using make test i get this error can i get some help on what it means tmpccjy2kvyo in function main filtertestcpptextstartup0x187 undefined reference to filterrecursivelist bool int collect2 error ld returned 1 exit status make filtertest error 1
student,i tried setting an integer that i initialized equal to the first element of a given list however i am getting an error that says expected unqualifiedid whats wrong here
student,i think im doing something incorrectly im trying to write an if statement with just a bool function inside for example if some bool functionsome integer input this is a thing im able to do right what am i doing wrong
student,suppose we have big tree b like 4 2 5 3 and a tree a 2 is a contained by b thanks
student,i just tried to compile and i got errors for every single helper function i have saying that helper function was not declared i think i found out why but i just want to double check are we supposed to put the helper function in before or after the function its actually helping
student,for the inserttree function do we have to return the same tree that was given for example can the top elements of the trees be different as long as its still in tree shapein order
student,can there be multiple if statements in the base case
student,im really lost as to what type of functions we will be tested over with accumulate obviously we should expect accumulate to work with things like addint x int y and multiplyint x int y but is there any other type of function that we couldshould test accumulate with thanks
student,when i try to compile my code on caen a message comes up saying binarytreecpp in static member function static int binarytreecalculatexoffsetint int binarytreecpp495 warning converting to int from double and no executable shows up
student,i have implemented my traversal function using tail recursive method and it works will i be penalized if i use this method note i didnt use a helper function
student,i saw the other piazza post on this but im still not sure what im doing wrong im in my p2 folder i checked with pwd and the only file i have in it right now is p2cpp i try running tar xzvf p2targz but i just get an error tar child p2targz cannot open no such file or directory tar child error is not recoverable exiting now tar child returned status 2 tar error is not recoverable exiting now what am i doing wrong here
student,im working on trees and i see for the sum it is treesum is this a typo and should be treet sum
student,what is the expected response from our program when passed empty lists for the append function
student,i typed my partner name wrong on the autograder and submit how can i fix that
student,once we finish writing filter and accumulate should we go back and call those from filterodd filtereven sum and product since we wrote the last 4 first we already have code but it seems that using the pointer functions we wrote would be useful in condensing our code
student,i understand that the identity is useful as a base case in our function but how is it useful with a pointer to an int function the function of identity is different for different functions how can the accumulate function anticipate what to do with it eg identitynn for an add func identitynn for multiply or is that something that accumulate is told through the function it points to
student,im still a bit confused on the wellsortedlist thing is the following a well sorted list 3 2 also if i inserted 1 into this tree would it go on the left tree of 2
student,where can we see the statistics for project 1
student,whenever i compile and run my p2testscpp file to test just my containedby function a file called p2testsexestackdump keeps getting created if i change a value in within the tree i have created and recompile and run the program instead of giving me either true1 or false0 for an answer it instead gives me outputs like 56 or 2 or anything else along those lines which doesnt make sense because its a boolean function is there a way to fix it would it be more helpful if i came to the office hours and have someone look at my code
student,the spec says that the element let must be inserted at a leaf i have quotes from the spec below effects returns a new tree with elt inserted at a leaf such that the resulting tree is also a sorted binary tree additionally we say a binary tree is a leaf if and only if both of its children are the emptytree but in the example in the header file and the example in the spec show it being inserted into a tree which isnt a leaf eg 2 3 becomes eg 2 1 3
student,what i am asking is is it possible for the function to be called with the element 2 or any elements in the tree as the spec says that the only thing required is that the tree be a sorted binary tree 4 2 4 1 5 5
student,i know that treeelttree returns the top most value of the regular tree but if one were to say treeelttreelefttree is that allowed will that return the first most value of the left tree wishful thinking appreciate the help
student,for the rotate function are we supposed to take into account lists that only have one value since technically it wouldnt really rotate
student,when were creating test cases for our functions are we required to use the listequal function or can we simply cout the list to terminal and visually see if the output is correct or will our test cases be graded on implementing the listequal function
student,in the project specs there is a line that says the longest is at most tens of lines of code including support functions in regards to the functions we are supposed to write in p2cpp is this a goodspirited reassurance that they are not going to be insanely long or is there a ten line limit for the functions we write for this project
student,should inserting a 6 into the top tree give this output im not sure if the definition of a wellsorted tree means that the 6 can go to the right of the 5 or not but im thinking it cant because it says that everything in the left side must be strictly less than the top element
student,i keep getting a segmentation fault as an error in my code however i dont know where i am trying to access memory that i am not suppose to isnt fibnfibn1fibn2 what we must use to find the nth number in the sequence
student,for the insertion of the element does the tree have to maintain the same shape as before or does it take on a new shape for example treea 4 2 6 1 3 7 inserttree5treea would it be 4 2 6 1 3 5 7 or can i just return a sorted tree of a different shape like 7 6 5 4 3 2 1
student,are there some trees that would not be possible to insert if so should we take this into account somehow or is it just required that the tree you want to insert will fit somewhere
student,i have been working on traversal for a while now and i havent gotten much done my reasoning for it is that i can go through the left branch first and then the right branch and then append the two resulting lists at the end is that the right approach
student,if the function has 1 parameter for example the fibtail function can we add as many parameters to the helper function as we feel necessary or only just one more
student,when running make test in the terminal there is an error of instance listexception and it is not clear what that means
student,i have read the project instructions and all the past posts for accumulate i understand what accumulate must do but i do not know what the identity is for is the project instructions saying that if i input the identity and any integer into the function fn then it will return just the identity for example if i had the function int product int x int y then the identity should be 1 because any integer n inputed into product multiplied by 1 is just n int product int n 1 n
student,rewriting listmin and listmax int maxint x int y return x y x y int minint x int y return x y x y int listextremelistt list int sofar int compintint if listisemptylist return sofar return listextreme listrestlist complistfirstlist sofar and use comp instead of min or max copied directly from slide 26 of lecture 5 why do you do return listextremelistrestlist complistfirstlist sofar instead of return listextremelistrestlist sofar complistfirstlist
student,how many test functions would you recommend writing for each function we have to implement
student,i declared and implemented coveredby and wrote test cases for it because i have test cases for it when i try to declare it static the build fails will the autogravder get tripped up if i submit my code without declaring coveredby static
student,are the trees that we have to check for containedby another tree not covered by passed in as trees with only one element or are they trees with many branches thanks
student,if i still have not received an email with the lab 2 post survey should i email someone thanks
student,i use eclipse and its autoformatting feature is it okay to use such formatting which is in a form of staircase as below listt appendedlist listmake2 listmake1 listmake0 listmake2 listmake1 listmake0 listmake
student,when compiling in xcode i am receiving 18 errors that all start with apple macho linker id error and i dont know how to fix these errors can anyone tell me what to do to get rid of these errors thanks
student,i understand how append works with strings but am confused on how it operates on lists does first second in the rme mean that our function should just put the two lists together and in any particular order
student,how are we expected to test our fibonacci functions and are we expected to test our tree functions inside out p2tests program
student,are we supposed to be using if statements other than the base case in the traversal function im unable to access the elements in the right branches and i thing using an if statement in the recursive call would help
student,i declared all my helper functions as static as per the specs but when i go to compile it says iso c forbids declaring for example sumhelper without a type however i put static in the front of the function declaration is there something else im supposed to be doing
student,the equation for fibonacci numbers multiple returns for fibn1 and fibn2 so im confused as to how we could ever make this tail recursive
student,are either of the following trees empty or are there empty trees somehow the ends of the these trees that dont have a value or any children a little confused
student,will we be penalized if we make both fib and fibtail tail recursive identical
student,hi if n is equal to the number of elements would it return 0 or an empty list thanks
student,im searching through my emails and am unable to find any related to the postlab for lab 2 is there any other way i can access it
student,ptr b means that ptr refers to b but what does it mean to refer to a variable
student,im looking at the fib functions right now would it be it be tail recursive if my fibtail called fib
student,after working on the project and going through and coding the recursion problems from past midterms i still feel like i would benefit from some more practice with recursion is anyone aware of a site with some more good recursive functions to try to make or even just some examples of other recursive things you can do with the trees and lists
student,can anyone recommend a good c repl for os xlinux it would be really helpful to have to follow along with during lecture
student,seems pretty unfair
student,looking at the parameters for accumulate i need a function pointer that returns an integer that takes 2 int arguments i dont have a function that takes 2 integers but i have functions that takes a list and return int does this mean that i have to write some sort of helper functions to make this work
student,im having trouble understanding the logic behind this function i understand that you need to take up until the nth element im having difficulty understanding how this is possible without knowing the length of a list i know how you would do it if you had to take the first n elements but not until the nth element i think they may be related some how but im not quite sure whats a better way too approach this function
student,hello is it possible for empty lists to be inserted into nonempty lists thanks
student,i am very confused about how we can keep update the list when we are calling function recursively for example i need to make a listt somewhere inside the traversal function if recursion occur it is going to reset my listt value but i want to keep the original one and keep update it without using helper function this seems impossible since the function is going to call itself then reset the list value how do i get around this
student,yes i have read through all of the past piazza posts on accumulate i am still horribly horribly confused otherwise return the tail recursive equivalent of fnlistfirstlist accumulatelistrestlist fn identity okay back up for one second i understand absolutely none of this the function is called accumulate okay well i understand what the word means but we already made our sum function okay wait wait hold on i might have just had an epiphany so similar to in lecture how we made a function that could use either min or max based on what we want we are basically making a function that can either add or multiply all the elements okay no im constantly desperately trying to understand what we are being asked to do but this one line is confusing in every way i just cant put anything in it together
student,hello are nested ifstatements okay thanks
student,i clearly must not be understanding this tail recursion thing i have kept the hint in mind while trying to come up with a solution i was able to do the normal recursive case without too much trouble are we supposed to call the normal recursive function at some point
student,does anyone know of or have experience with companies that will be at the career fair that offer their internships in nyc
student,in a regular recursive function is it possible to call itself in the same line for example if you had int fooint x blah returnfoox1 foox is this allowed and if so how are the stackframes arranged
student,im so lost as to how to write inserttree i know we have to do the inorder traversal but im completely clueless as to where to go from there can someone point me in the right direction
student,i dont understand the rme for the accumulate function for example if you have the following function int addint x int y then the following invocation returns the sum of all elements accumulatelist add 0 it will return the sum of what elements the ones contained in list and what does the function add and the 0 do
student,when we work on accumulate does our solution have to be tail recursive
student,do we still need to write a test case for our last filter function even though we are given the file filtertestcpp we wrote tests for filterodd and filtereven but im wondering if we need to write a test for filter
student,is it impossible to use tail recursion when dealing with trees if so how do we return a list for traversal when we can only use a tree variable in the body
student,i was just wondering what your definition of odd is for negative numbers i see 0 is even but not odd thank you
student,can a tree element be 0
student,i am testing a function in labser and its outputting what is expected however when i try the same function in linux i get a different output so im not if theres something wrong with my code or labster thanks
student,lets say that list bob contains 10 if you do listt bill listrestlistrestbob is bill an empty list now thanks
student,i just want to clarify does listfirst convert the list into an integer with only the first number can we access the original list after using this function
student,there was a list of companies and times up on the blackboard during the session could anyone supply a link to that information
student,question 688 asked a similar question but that was about multiple calls to multiple helper function so i guess im asking if the following is tail recursive function declares some list list helper function helper function tail recursive
student,my partner and i dont understand the filter function could someone provide an example of the third filter function thanks
student,ive looked through all the posts about this function but im still confused on how to start it what i have in mind right now is find the most left element and then go backwards maybe if this is the correct approach how do we go backward
student,how do i get past an error in terminal when p2tests is called it is labeled segmentation 11
student,were trying to test our sum function but the listmake function isnt creating a list we didnt touch the listmake function are we supposed to write listmake
student,i didnt receive my first lab score so i was wondering it that was even released the grade
student,this is what terminal does when i try to run p2tests i thought it could be because i didnt include the right files so i added include recursiveh at the top of p2testscpp thats in addition to include p2h and include testhelpersh which were there when i downloaded the code from google drive thanks
student,can we have multiple assert statements in one unit test if for example we wanted to test each element of a list and used asserts to check against a correct list
student,the code that is provided to us tests our countdigit function for when n 0 and digit 0 the function i wrote works correctly for this but i realized it would not work if n 000000 while digit 0 my function would return 1 instead of 6 is it fair to assume that we would not need to look out for this or should our functions be able to return 6 in this scenario
student,im a little confused on how listmake works im thinking of how i would want to do the reverse function right now so i guess for example say i wanted to make a new list and reorganize stuff from another list into the new one using listmakeint elt const listt list so naturally i would have to start by making an empty list if i were to do this but then in the end would the empty element still prove to be a problem in the new list so if i were to do something like this for reverse and i was given the list 123 then i would end up with 321empty element would this be a problem in making the correct reversed list if so does this mean we cant really do reverse in a way like this
student,where is the postlab survey i cant find it anywhere in my inbox thanks
student,ex is this a tree 9 5 10 2 7 13 3 8 in the left branch looking at the branch beginning with 5 3 is to the right of 5 but doesnt fulfill the requirement that it must be greater than 5 therefore do all sorted trees have to have all subbranches also be sorted trees or is it only dependent upon the highest branch
student,will the correct implementations of the requested code in the surveys be provided somewhere even though it is not graded on correctness i am still curious to see if i got it correct or not
student,do we need to include the name of libraries we used in the submitted files
student,is it acceptable to have a helper function with a helper function or should i avoid that completely for this project
student,this is what terminal does when i try to run p2tests i thought it could be because i didnt include the right files so i added include recursiveh at the top of p2testscpp thats in addition to include p2h and include testhelpersh which were there when i downloaded the code from google drive thanks
student,i deleted some provided test codes and wrote some of my own now i cannot revert it to the original will that be okay if i turn in the work
student,when i print what i return from reverse and append in my p2testscpp i only get the first list even though when i print within the function it prints the correct list a reversed list in reverse etc anyone know why that is
student,for the append function that we have to write is it necessary that we create a new list to return or are we able to add values into one of the lists passed into the function
student,my function is returning an empty list but it is still somehow passing the assertion when i compare it to the expected list is there a bug with the assertion or is it just my code having unexpected results
student,in both the lab and the lab survey all my recursive functions ended up doing is calling the helper functions which then did all the work why are we bothering writing recursive functions that need helpers why wouldnt we just give the function the extra parameter it needs from the start and call it a day
student,if we use 2 tail recursive helper functions does our function that is being graded for output need to be recursive at all thank you
student,a general question for labs and projects do we ever have to consider the case that violates requires clause
student,i am implementing int countdigitsrecursiveint n int digit and im not sure how to keep track of the count in the iterative function i kept track of the count with int count 0 and then count but since we call the function in itself how are we supposed to track the count without resetting it should we change the function to int countdigitsrecursiveint n int digit int count or should we create and call on a separate function to count thanks
student,the context for this post is that i would like to figure out the best way to complete assignments for 280 i spent a lot of time and energy familiarizing myself with xcode in 183 and i found it both rewarding and effective id like to do the same in 280 with an ide or text editor that will both help me succeed in 280 and give me a useful set of tools for future eecs courses question 1 i am on a macbook air and i often dont have access to the internet even when i do have the internet the vnc viewer does work very well on my computer because of the super small display so my first question is is there a way to optimize the caen vnc viewer when youre remotely accessing it through a mac question 2 if i do manage to make the vnc viewer work well enough what is the best text editor or ide to use in that environment by best i mean the one that is most likely to help me succeed in this course and beyond and that will help me cultivate marketable skills question 3 if i do work offline on my computer whats the best way to do this in such a way that i can code test compile and then upload it to a linux environment later question 4 my particular context aside what are the best text editors and ides for eecs students if you had a blank slate of a student what you would you recommend program on caen computers in sublime program in vim program in xcode thank you for the help
student,just a general annoyance i should have mentioned in my survey but i wish there was an easier way submit my lab files rather than copying it saving it on my desktop as a cpp file and submitting it to ctools each time labster rocks though
student,are we graded on style in labs
student,so listequal is not in the given functions of the list interface but are we allowed to use it when testing functions that return a list or should we be testing those in another way
student,are the prelab and postlab surveys supposed to be extra difficult or am i just not getting how to do the functions
student,i keep getting a segmentation error when i attempt to compile
student,are we allowed to reuse the functions were written already in other functions such as can we call reverse in append
student,what is considered proper style in terms of commenting placement int functionint num check base case if n 0 return or int functionint num if n 0 return check base case
student,i created a void static helper function for int sum in p2cpp i included a reference to it in p2h and implemented it in p2cpp however i keep getting the error that the helper function i created sumh is unused the code wont compile what should i do about this
student,in the specs for project two it says we can only use the c standard and iostream libraries this may be a dumb question but what does this include exactly specifically which ones of these can i not use include iostream include string include vector include cassert include cmath include iomanip using namespace std and can i use this
student,under the effects it says it needs to be recursion for hailstonetail but based on the function name should it be tailrecursive
student,im not sure what my make test file is actually doing i created a few functions then realized hey i should probably test these before i go on so ive been trying to test i ran the long g line then make test i get this output and im unsure what its saying i thought the simple test given was computing a sum
student,when i use listmake is the original list changed or its still there
student,when the listrest is used is the original list changed
student,does countdigitstail need a helper
student,are we graded just on completion for the lab
student,in this lecture slide right here when listextreme is called a second time is sofar not taken in as a parameter even though its defined on the original function
student,hello i am assuming that we cant use any helper functions for the tail recursive function but wanted to make sure thanks
student,in the rme for this function it says that this function requires a sorted binary tree this may be a silly question but is the empty tree a sorted binary tree
student,is there any chance we could get some office hours this weekend im really stuck on a few things and seem to be hitting dead ends otherwise i understand if it isnt possible but it would be appreciated
student,when traveling down the tree to the left in traversal you find and record the leftmost value how do you make it so that when you use recursion it does not follow the same path making it choose the right side of the tree instead of the left from there
student,using the given list in the given test case i am trying to test my product function using assert i set it to check if my product returns 24 because the list is 01234 however it says the assertion fails but when i cout my result in my actual product function it is equal to 24 any ideas on whats going wrong i have defined everything in product as an int and it returns an int as well should i use a range for it like we did for project 1 for standard deviation
student,for our accumulate function what should we have out code do if the identity value is invalid should we just have the code throw an error
student,i really dont understand what the last filter function is asking what are we checking for
student,for many of my functions i have been using helper functions to deal with tail recursion is this expected or should i not be using helper functions for a majority of my functions
student,how do i turn in the labs do i just paste my code into textedit and upload these txt files anything needed in particular
student,i have 60 lines of code but labster is giving me syntax error on line 61 what does this mean
student,any idea on whats happening all my other tests work except this one so g stopped compiling out of nowhere on me i havent edited any files except p2cpp and p2testscpp
student,the projet spec did not clearly state whether the first edge counts as a double left because the diagrams given by the instructors have two dashes most of the time and the treeprint function outputs one edge can i get some clarity on what output the autograder will expect from the traversal function
student,if you make an ordinary recursive loop and it goes on forever it will crash the program with a tail recursive loop would an infinite loop not crash the program because it doesnt require additional memory each time
student,do we need to include libraries such as iostream or define using namespace std in the cpp files we are submitting in the labster code the libraries and namespace are not shown
student,for writing tail recursive functions are we allowed to change the function signatures or do we always have to use a helper function
student,for the 5 of our final grade noted as discussion exercises is that grade just comprised of the completion of the lab exercises due in ctools and surveys that are due by sunday night
student,i cant figure out how to get my code to read that there is one 0 in 0 ive tried making a case to look for when n and digit are both 0 but then it will tell me that there are two 0s in 2120 is there anything im not thinking of
student,on firefox the survey does not work i tried clicking on the link and it takes me to a loading page that does not stop on safari it takes me to a page that says i have already taken the survey when i have not any ideas as to what is wrong here
student,im having trouble figuring out the base case for countdigitscpp for the functions ive only managed to write the iterative function but when i run the tests i pass all of them except for one the one asking for 0 what do you suggest that i do to figure this out
student,im completely lost as to how to do reverse if listmake can only add single elements to the front of the list how are we ever going to add the first element to the end
student,hi every time i call function treemake the complier warns me error no matching function for call to ‘treemakeint treet int’ also i cannot use treemake to create empty tree
student,can we use the push back function to insert an element into a list
student,i think i am finished with lab 2 however i have a question for my non tail recursive function i used a helper function as another post said was acceptable however the lobster guy said the main function that uses the helper function is not recursive however the lobster says that the helper function itself is recursive but not tail recursive as desired is this alright am i done is it acceptable to use helper functions for non tail recursive things
student,when trying to compile p2cpp we receive these errors we are attempting to compile using make p2 after navigating to the correct directory and we are using the same code that we compiled successfully yesterday we also redownloaded all of the files from the project 2 drive and tried yet again to recompile our p2cpp included at the top of this file are include p2h include iostream and include cassert this has led us to believe that the issue may stem from caen are we missing something
student,hello for my sum and product functions at the very end i am returning the sum or product of each successive value passed through the function until the list is empty return sumnum sumlist return num productlist is this tail recursive if i used a helper function i would still need to perform addition and multiplication somewhere
student,ive been thinking about how to write traversal for a while now and im totally lost im really struggling with ordering the elements correctly as i go down each subtree can someone give me a nudge in the right direction thanks
student,i would like to write a function that converts a vector into a list for use in my p2testscpp file only this is only for debugging purposes and making it easier to type the correct list for comparison in assert are we allowed to include additional libraries for debugging only
student,for all my lists in all of my test cases every single one is printing in the reverse of my intended order with use of the for loop when adding numbers to a list do they always go in the opposite way somehow or is it possible my reverse function has contaminated my other code
student,hi im wondering if we test the function accumulate shall we also write fn like add and multiple thank you
student,for example can we use the reverse function we wrote in our append function
student,all of the cpp files complie but however i got a return code incorrect on my p2testcpp does it mean that my test case is not complete i mean if the autograder is giving a very tricky and wrong function and my test case fails to abort the function then it will show return code incorrect thank you
student,hi i recently submitted my code to the autograder i am slightly confused on the output of the autograder based on my test cases everything is working correctly assuming that i computed everything correctly and compared the output of the respective functions to the correct output properly what does it mean that if it states return code incorrect for p2 compiliations check because of this misunderstanding i am not quite sure how i should begin to debug for this error
student,all of these functions require that n0 so what are we supposed to return if n is passed in as a negative number do we just return the original list return an empty list
student,when i try to compile p2cpp and p2testscpp i get a long list of errors like this are we supposed to include recursivelisth in our p2cpp file
student,should i be worried if my accumulate function works reguardless of the value of identity sent to it like even if i make it 101etc it outputs the correct sumproduct
student,i am trying to test a function however when i type go p2tests i get no output if theres something else i need to do please let me know
student,just to make sure im understanding the project specs correctly the only functions we are to write are the ones noted in p2h correct also we write tests in p2testscpp
student,are we allowed to store the list into an array using recursion then just conduct operations on the array
student,does it matter if both lists have some of the same content eg if list1 1 2 3 4 5 and if list23 4 5 6 7 should the new list be 1 2 3 4 5 3 4 5 6 7 or rather 1 2 3 4 5 6 7
student,hi im wondering if there is any difference between these two phrases
student,hi will this work making b equal to a or can we only do listmake initializations listt a listmake listt b a
student,hi when indicating our partners on the autograder are we supposed to use the following format uniqnameumichedu or just enter the uniqname thanks
student,im a math major and im taking eecs 280 for fun if that is such a thing i heard rumors that you can no longer take eecs 280 passfail is that true i switched the class from being graded to being passfail on wolverine access and it seemed to be fine
student,when i write listt test listmakelistfirstotherlist test it gives me a segmentation fault but when i write this listt test listmake test listmakelistfirstotherlist test it works as it should can someone explain this
student,what does fn mean how to use it
student,when i attempt to use listequal to compare two lists for my append function i get a segmentation fault when i print the two lists they produce the same results but the listequal is producing the segmentation fault for some reason is there a reason why this is happening
student,im just wondering how we can return the control to a prior tree when we finish examining a subtree
student,in my append function i would like to use the reverse function but only once since i only want it to be done once will i have to use a helper function or is there another way to do this
student,if a function is declared seperatly from where it is defined at which of the locations should the rme commenting be present
student,are we allowed to use cmath on project 2
student,i have a conflict with the final exam and submitted the final exam conflict form when it came out how can i confirm that this got through and that i am all set for the makeup time thanks
student,is it possible to see what specific cases our functions in problem 1 failed during the tests i think this would help us write more useful test programs in the future if we could see exactly what tests broke our code
student,sorry if this is a little late i just found out i have a conflict on the final exam what should i do
student,in lab 2 saw that we can use a helper function for the tail recursive call of counting the digits however isnt usually the helper function the thing that is tail recursive instead of the function that uses the helper function would doing this satisfy the requirement of using tail recursion to count the number of times a digit occurs even though the function that main or more accurately the helper function of main calls does not use tail recursion but its helper function does
student,can someone please explain the identity argument in the accumulate function i have read the spec but still am confused thank you
student,so in recursivecpp it says the listmake function returns a new list with the new element in the front however in the listmake function it calls recursivelistcpp and i cant find it creating or naming a new list anywhere does listmake simply modify the input list
student,the only thing i added or edited to any of the project files was the function for sum in p2cpp i tried testing it with the given function in p2testscpp and it compiled but when i ran it i got this error why would the list be empty
student,cannot seem to find any buttons or links on the autograder page that links to project 1 can anyone tell me how
student,i apologize if this was answered somewhere already but does the score on ctools include the style grade and everything so is it the final grade
student,in regards to the announcement made about requesting regrades where can we see how our projects were graded
student,when i log into the autograder it only gives a link to project 2 is the project 1 link on the way
student,for the digit counting nontail recursive function in lab 2 can it be done without a helper function the instructions say in the tail recursive version feel free to add a helper function with an extra parameter to accumulate the result but what about in the nontail one thanks
student,so im on caen linux and im trying to commit my changes to my partners git repo when it says please enter the commit message for your changes i dont know how to continue enter just moves down the marker down the screen what do
student,when i compile in terminal and use this g wall werror pedantic o2 p2cpp p2testscpp recursivelistcpp recursivecpp binarytreecpp i can pass the test case but when i compile in terminal with make test i get this make test g wall werror pedantic o2 filtertestcpp p2cpp recursivelistcpp binarytreecpp recursivecpp testhelperscpp o filtertest undefined symbols for architecture x8664 filterrecursivelist bool int referenced from main in filtertestfc54b0o ld symbols not found for architecture x8664 clang error linker command failed with exit code 1 use v to see invocation make filtertest error 1 dont really understand whats going on here
student,for every function that i made a helper function for i am getting the error helperfunction was not declared in this scope does anyone know why this might be happening
student,im confused about the going upwards part can somebody explain
student,im unclear on the instructions which seem to imply that it is possible to write fibtail without the use of helper functions is that accurate or can i use helper functions provided that they are all tail recursive
student,i was wondering how we would order the list if two elements are equally left for example 4 2 3 1 1 and 2 are at the same leftness so which would go into the list first
student,when i try to use gdb to debug i get the message no debugging symbols found or no symbol table is loaded and i cant set any breakpoints to debug any advice
student,do both people need to have the same exact code when working together or can they differ im asking because i found a partner after starting on the project
student,for lab02 countdigitscpp are we allowed to use a helper function for the normal recursive function the instructions say we should use one for tail recursion but it doesnt say whether or not were allowed to use a helper function for the recursion function
student,can we cast an int into a listt
student,is it possible to write tests for helper functions in p2testscpp i tried making my helpers temporarily nonstatic but i still get a helper function was not declared in this scope error in p2testscpp thanks
student,the makelist function makes a list with an element followed by a list is there a way to make a list with a list followed by an element so instead of list1 1 list it would be list1 list 1
student,for countdigitscpp in lab02 were asked to create a normal recursion function how do we keep track of the number of times digit appears in n count i know tail recursion solves this problem by adding an extra parameter i tried making a static int count and initialized that as 0 which works when the function is only called once the second time the function is called the old count is added to the new count any help would be appreciated
student,where is the postsurvey for lab 2 i havent received an email yet
student,is it okay to use size to get the number of elements in a list
student,im working on the insertlist function and i thought of a way to do it but it requires two helper functions is that allowed
student,hello since introducing new values into a list via the listmake function pushes it forward ahead of the list being modified im not sure how to add the second lists values to the first list without reversing the first list and then adding that to the second list with the last values of the reversed list going forward thereby reverting it back to the proper order of the first list is this on the right track also how much does working alone on projects help you on the exams thanks
student,im wondering that if we want to use fn in the body statement of accumulate would it be fn or fn that is syntactically correct
student,is it a valid recursive solution to start from n 0 and recursively increment n until it reaches the base case n some number rather than the base case being n 0 and recursively decrementing n
student,can we use vectors or arrays to store the values of the elements in the list
student,the project guidelines were slightly ambiguous is it necessary that the fib function not be tail recursive right now i implemented them both in the same way using tail recursion
student,effects returns the list first second i dont quite get the effects listt appendlistt first listt second do you mean add second list after the last element of first list
student,ive found how to navigate to where the new element needs to be inserted but im lost on how to actually do the insertion without rebuilding the whole tree since we can only interface with the structure using the given functions can anyone point me in the right direction
student,is it tail recursive to update the loop variable before recursively calling the helper function again or is it only tail recursive when we return the variable incrementeddecremented within the recursive call for example are both implementations tail recursive or only the second int factorialhelperint n base case n 1 return factorialhelpern int factorialhelperint n base case return factorialhelpern 1
student,are we permitted to overload the operator in order to compare two lists for example if list1 list2 do something
student,when will we get our project 1 grade
student,what is the proper style for implementing helper functions specifically do you want us to have the helper function immediately above the function that its helping or do you want us to have all the helper functions at the top of p2cpp somewhere else thanks
student,i used terminal to connect my computer to the caen server ssh within my terminalcaen server i went to the folder where i have proj 2 files i dont know how would i open makefile i tried makefile but it gives me permission denied error then i tried sudo makefile then i am getting an error message that i cant understand how can i fix this
student,are office hours in the bbb canceled today i dont see anyone queued and theres a red line on the calendar on ctools
student,when i input the command for running p2testscpp i am getting no output back at all like this bash42 g wall werror pedantic o2 p2testscpp p2cpp recursivelistcpp binarytreecpp recursivecpp testhelperscpp o p2tests bash42 it just prompts me to enter the next command i have not modified p2testscpp at all just written the first function in p2cpp am i entering the command wrong
student,what do they generally contain and not contain
student,i was wondering if we could use any c library in the p2tests and the p2cpp files
student,when should grace hopper attendees expect to figure out their situation for the midterm i still have to book my flight and an update is much appreciated so that i can know when to prepare thanks
student,i was working on finishing the lab survey but my browser crashed and now when i try to open the survey again it says that there is a network error how can i fix this
student,i was trying to make the containedby function i traverse both trees by preorder and inorder and save those elements in different lists then i compare those elements which i saved in those lists is that a correct way to do it how can i know a tree is a subtree of another one can someone give me some ideas
student,i realize this is a very simple question however i am having trouble answering it how do we test our functions in p2cpp from the command line i realize that we have a p2testscpp file but every time i run it i get an access denied response from the terminal tia
student,and so does the lab1 score thanks
student,in lecture today we used the example of listmax and there were three functions static int max int listmaxh and int listmax im trying to understand using helper functions and this added to my confusion since we used two additional functions how do you know to use another function in addition to the helper function is this to replace declaring a variable in the function for reference
student,using the command from the project 2 pdf to unarchive all the files for project 2 tar xzvf p2targz getting the error tar child p2targz cannot open no such file or directory tar child error is not recoverable exiting now tar child returned status 2 tar error is not recoverable exiting now anyone else getting this its not super important just wanted to check if the archive is there
student,i cant seem to wrap my mind around this example int listlengthtailhelperlistt list int result if listisemptylist return result return listlengthtailhelper listrestlist result 1 int listlengthtaillistt list return listlengthtailhelperlist 0 could someone please explain it how does calling return listlengthtailhelper listrestlist result 1 help what would result 1 be and does it continue to increase or is it always going to be 1 or 2
student,if its not a hassle is it possible for a gsiprofessor create project 2 project 3 project 5 tabs instead of having one general project tab i think itll be easier for people to search for their questions instead of asking it again as we go further into the course
student,hi i tried looking for the project 2 autograder but was facing some difficulty opening the autograder site is it available or is the browser im using just buggy please let me know and thanks
student,can someone explain the difference between the two i know passive flow occurs for recursions and active flow occurs for iterations thanks
student,if the requires clause is violated do we want our tests to fail gracefully ie return nothing or do some handling if relevant or blow up and scream and err out in the latter case how should we turn in failurehandling tests for instance if i have a test case that violates the requires clause and i want to test out the blow up and scream because bad input functionality itll crash my driver program so would i want to comment that out so the autograder doesnt see that oh my goodness something is blowing up and screaming id better fail this student because something is blowing up and screaming and fail me should we even bother doing failure case testing of this nature ie lets test that the program crashes or should i throw the fail cases in another protected script or handle the appropriate exceptions or what
student,can we include testhelpers in p2cpp the project spec says you may use only the c standard and iostream libraries but no others but since we also have to include p2h in p2cpp im assuming that the rule doesnt apply to files provided in the google drive thanks
student,i know we cant use for loops in the processing functions that were implementing but is it ok to use them when writing test cases for example adding values to a list that were going to use to test a function
student,should we create a helper function to do tail recursion when it can be done without one or can tail recursion only be done with the use of a helper function
student,i am writing function stubs for all of my functions in order to compile however i recieve an assertion false failed error from simpletestout after running make test the error occurs on the listt reverselistt list function line any thoughts
student,hello i believe in order to implement the list functions you need to include the recursiveh prototypes thanks
student,when a list has one element or is empty can we just check for that and return before ever calling the helper function or do we need to even use tail recursion for empty lists and 1 element lists
student,hello while writing my sum function i encountered these errors that im not sure what they mean p2cpp in function ‘int sumlistt’ p2cpp2223 error ‘sum’ cannot be used as a function return sum sumlist p2cpp231 error control reaches end of nonvoid function werrorreturntype thanks
student,are we allowed to use include list in order to get the size of a list
student,ive followed the directions on the editor and ide guidelines for downloading and installing sublime on redhat linux however when i put the copypaste lines in the terminal it gives me an error saying that there is no such file or directory when i check my downloads the file is there am i missing something thank you
student,so is it possible to append an element and a list of elements using just a sign
student,if im on terminal and going through my directories what can i type to open my file on sublime text for the lab i just used pico filename and edited it on the terminal but instead i want to open my file on my text editor
student,based on the comments given in the rotate rme it looks like n 0 is actually not zero rotations but one can someone confirm this
student,when i use the command diff lab01outcorrect lab01out i get the following 4a5 i dont detect any differences when i open the files though and im not sure what this refers to
student,the project 2 spec is very clear the we should not include any cpp files like binarytreecpp does this also mean we shouldnt include binarytreeh thanks
student,so when i use wget to copy the files of the project to my directory i get an error can i just download the file directly from the drive or is this not an option
student,i still dont know if i need to do a helper function for sum and product i wrote the functions using nontail recursion and i cant think of a way to fix it without a helper function but what if i just dont know what im doing for that matter where would the helper function actually do right now i have something like return x sumy so i know i need to get rid of the but how exactly could a helper function do that
student,i got an email telling me about these sessions every sunday from 230 4 at mason hall i cant find mason hall on google maps where exactly is it located and is there any parking nearby
student,looking for partner for project 2 im coming from eecs183 won award for final project from wolverine trading email me if interested maydentumichedu
student,i am wondering how we can tell if we got full points on the labs or not where can we see our score after it is uploaded is it just an accepted full points or not accepted no points type of grading
student,sorry to ask about empty lists all the time but sum and product told us what outputs to give when given empty lists but what about the various other functions like reverse append or filter there isnt a require clause thanks
student,when i use the pwd command in the terminal the result is just homeuniqname not that long url in the lab spec so then when i then type that long url into the search bar of linuxs finder the exact same stuff as is in homeuniqname shows up except the home folder on the side goes from highlighted to not highlighted im guessing theyre one and the same and the lab spec just described it showing up in the proper technical way not whatever way my computer is doing it can someone confirm thanks
student,this function doesnt have a requires clause so im under the assumption that an empty list could be passed to it would the sum of an empty list be 0 or would it be an error thanks
student,how can i figure out the base case for the reverse function they are using the linked list so how can i know the size or last element can someone give me a idea to start or think about
student,i can not seem to understand how to implement reverse i considered using the makefile and the adding one element to another list functions but it isnt getting me anywhere
student,have we learned enough information yet to start the project and if not when would you recommend starting also where can i get a good intro tutorial on lists
student,i am trying to create an expected list so that i can use assert function just like when testing sum or product function const listt expectedlist listt actuallist reverselista assertexpectedlist actuallist how should i initialize a list of type listt can one use assert at all for listts
student,hello i have three questions regarding project 2 1 why is recursiveh which contains listt functions separate from p2h which also contains listt functions 2 does the list produced in listt enable you to access individual elements just like you can access individual elements in vectorint like myvectorat 3 while i was writing my sum function i was confused as to whether the lists produced could be accessed elementbyelement or if they had to be summed up while the lists were being made thanks
student,can someone please explain how the accumulate function works because the given comments are not helping me at all for reference int accumulatelistt list int fnint int int identity requires fn must be associative effects return identity if list is empty otherwise return the tail recursive equivalent of fnlistfirstlist accumulatelistrestlist fn identity be sure to make your code tailrecursive for example if you have the following function int addint x int y then the following invocation returns the sum of all elements accumulatelist add 0 the identity argument is typically the value for which fnx identity x and fnidentity x x for any x
student,here is my output after i use make test the outputs seem to be the exact same thing but the diff check says otherwise is there a reason for this
student,do we need to use tail recursion for functions eg listisempty that require no real recursive steps
student,i know how to ssh into caen but how would i link sublime text or any other text editor to caen so when i save my files on the editor it updates the version on linux
student,im having trouble wrapping my mind around the first function were supposed to implement int sumlistt list i cant think of how to use recursion for this should we somehow use the listfirst and listrest and call listfirst from every listrest until you have no more listrests and does this require other helper functions
student,the internet in my apartment is really bad and im unable to watch the lecture recordings the only lecture that fits in my schedule is 280x and therefore i need to watch the lecture recordings id prefer to watch them at home as opposed to somewhere on campus for convenience because of their length so i was just wondering if theres anyway to download them so i can watch them later on offline thanks a lot
student,when will we get more details about teams for project 2 because the specification says that we will have to register as a group on the autogradder
student,here is the problem i opened my visual studio created a new project then just add the files downloaded from google drive however it doesnt compile and show me the following things anyone have an idea thanks t
student,so when i was following the instruction asked the ternminal to print out the value of pupulation it gave me 250000 instead of zero i dont know what happened the only thing diferent is that after i typed break point 7 then run it asked me whether start from beginning
student,should the helper functions in p2cpp go underneath the corresponding function or in a separate cpp file also do we write rmes for helper functions if so then do we add these in p2h or in p2cpp
student,the requires clause says requires fn must be associative but does not say anything about whether fn can be null i assume that we do not have to deal with the case where fn is a null pointer but and am looking for confirmation
student,what is the purpose of the identity parameter in accumulate it doesnt seem to have a purpose in the function
student,from what ive heard the solutions to the practice exams are not posted is there a reason for this why make it harder for students to study efficiently for the exams and how should we study for the exams so we know that we have mastered the material
student,the project 2 spec says you can use recursion and selection i know what recursion is but what does it mean by selection also what does this mean if you define any helper functions be sure to declare them static i dont really understand the term static in this context thanks
student,undeclared identifier problem during my test run on visual studio i keep getting error message like this but i checked my code and dont know why since all variables mentioned are defined in function implementations any help would be appreciated 1 build started project project1 configuration debug win32 1 statscpp 1enginlabsmstorageumichedusiyuwangwindatv2documentsvisual studio 2013projectsproject1project1statscpp15 warning c4244 initializing conversion from double to int possible loss of data 1enginlabsmstorageumichedusiyuwangwindatv2documentsvisual studio 2013projectsproject1project1statscpp28 error c2065 total undeclared identifier 1enginlabsmstorageumichedusiyuwangwindatv2documentsvisual studio 2013projectsproject1project1statscpp28 error c2065 i undeclared identifier 1enginlabsmstorageumichedusiyuwangwindatv2documentsvisual studio 2013projectsproject1project1statscpp29 error c2065 total undeclared identifier 1enginlabsmstorageumichedusiyuwangwindatv2documentsvisual studio 2013projectsproject1project1statscpp31 error c2065 i undeclared identifier 1enginlabsmstorageumichedusiyuwangwindatv2documentsvisual studio 2013projectsproject1project1statscpp32 error c2065 size undeclared identifier 1enginlabsmstorageumichedusiyuwangwindatv2documentsvisual studio 2013projectsproject1project1statscpp34 warning c4244 initializing conversion from double to int possible loss of data 1enginlabsmstorageumichedusiyuwangwindatv2documentsvisual studio 2013projectsproject1project1statscpp39 error c2065 counter undeclared identifier 1enginlabsmstorageumichedusiyuwangwindatv2documentsvisual studio 2013projectsproject1project1statscpp40 error c2065 counter undeclared identifier 1enginlabsmstorageumichedusiyuwangwindatv2documentsvisual studio 2013projectsproject1project1statscpp42 error c2065 counter undeclared identifier 1enginlabsmstorageumichedusiyuwangwindatv2documentsvisual studio 2013projectsproject1project1statscpp43 warning c4244 conversion from double to int possible loss of data 1enginlabsmstorageumichedusiyuwangwindatv2documentsvisual studio 2013projectsproject1project1statscpp47 error c2065 counter undeclared identifier build 0 succeeded 1 failed 0 uptodate 0 skipped

student,is autograder down or is it just stalled because there are too many submissions at once my submission is shown as being graded for almost 20 minutes now main and public test have gone through but the last one student test compliation is just hanging there anyone with similar problem
student,ive used the diff command and sdiff command on terminal and the output is the same between mine and maintestoutcorrect but im still failing the test main on autograder earlier i was failing public test but passing test main until i tweaked the percentile function and the results flipflopped im thinking it must be related but i dont know why im failing if there are no differences

student,so i have working code for each of the files and when i use the caen compiler it compiles fine however for reasons unknown the autograder fails to compile every time i submit is there some difference between the caen g and the autograder that i am not aware of
student,i went to the caen computers in the ugli basement to finish up my code so it can compile correctly in the autograder but when i tried to log in it said i didnt have permission i thought they automatically gave us our accounts if we were enrolled in the class now the caen offices are closed and i cant get access to an account with the project due soon and my code unable to run through linux as it is i dont know what to do now
student,i tried submitting to the autograder but it said that none of my files compiled im using xcode so i knew that there was a chance that this could happen but what can i do to fix it
student,
student,last night i was getting 33 on the autograder i made some small changes that did not effect the output of my code yet 2 or 1 of the tests say my output is wrong i also drag and drop the exact same files over and over again into the autograder sometimes 2 tests fail and sometimes 1 test fails what could be causing this
student,do we need a test case for the summarize function
student,so all my other test cases and functions work but for some reason the summarize function is showing this for the real data test is anyone else having this issue where all the test cases work besides real data
student,i am attempting to submit maincpp statscpp and statstestscpp to the autograder however when i upload all three and then hit submit the autograder treats it as 3 seperate submissions with missing files anybody else experiencing this
student,im having some difficulty extracting the data in the columns in the maintestdata file im not sure how im suppose to access it when its a string but the parameters being passed through all of the functions are doubles im not sure if im calling my functions properly but im super confused
student,where do we submit project1 do we just submit to autograder
student,i have been failing public test on autograder every time i submit i know there must be a bug in my code somewhere so i created many many test cases negatives integers zeroes decimals large small everything i could think of basically my code has no problems with any of it i came to office hours but they said they didnt know what was wrong and to post on piazza about it please help
student,when i try to compile the file they gave us it says that testsmalldatasetcpp cannot be declared in this scope what problem am i having here
student,will we lose style points if we use auto to declare variables rather than explicitly defining a primitive type
student,im having trouble submitting my files to the autograder via the ctools page is it possible to do it directly from the caen virtual machine
student,if we write functions to do the test cases do we have to write an rme for those functions
student,i think the population will change from 250000 to 0 after line 7 but mine didnt does anyone know why that happened
student,is it possible the autograder will test for a case where the data has over 2 million data numbers should we be using the data type long
student,i am using statstestscpp to test my stats functions and i wrote a test with numbers in the vector v that have 3 or 4 decimals i summed them all on a calculator and got an answer to 4 decimal places and put that in the assert statement then i ran the code and had a cout statement in there to see what the actual sum was that my sum function was printing out and it was only accurate to 3 decimal places so it was considered wrong how do i fix this what are some possible problems thanks
student,i cannot submit my files to the autograder correct due to the autograder only reading the files independently it says that i am missing other files even though i submitted all three
student,how do i get in que for a staff member to help me does anybody know where there is info on the new online signup
student,hi is it acceptable to have the functions print error messages if the requirements arent met i know its not necessary but it doesnt seem like it would hurt i am just wondering if points would be taken off for this also i didnt see this is the style guidelines or project 1 pdf but i think it may have been mentioned in lecture do we need to put our name in a comment at the beginning of the file thanks
student,hi instructors i pushed back the following values to a double vector 100010011002 and 1002001 and then tried my max function and it returned 1002 im wondering if i should be concerned about the vector truncating that input or not it works with 100201 so im fairly positive this is an issue of how the input is being stored
student,hi i know this may be a little annoying of a question to ask but when will the second project be released i would like to start working on it sooner rather than later as i heard that this class becomes quite difficult starting at project 2 thanks
student,what do we output in maincpp if the vector has less than 2 elements do we just not include stdev or do we say its undefined
student,when i submit to the autograder it says my statstestcpp file is unnecessary how can i submit it just to clarify im also suppose to email eecs280staffumichedu correct
student,when autograder tests maincpp is it using the statscpp we upload ie if our statscpp is wrong will our maincpp be wrong if maincpp output is incorrect could it be an issue with statscpp
student,i wrote test cases for the percentile function and in one of them i set p to be 07 when it failed the test case i stepped through the function to find out that the p value had been assigned to 06999999999996 instead of 07 so my function returns a number thats slightly off from what i calculated that it should be if p is 07 would this fail the autograder how do i fix it
student,when dealing with negative numbers and calculating percentile the percentile comes out negative according to the equation we were given but can percentile be negative should i leave it as a negative percentile or would it make sense to flip the sign
student,is anyone else having issues loading the autograder ive been trying to load the autograder all morning but have been unable to do so ive tried multiple browsers etc etc but still always get stuck staring at the loading bar
student,im having problems with the summarize function for example if the number 6 is repeated once it will print 6 2 and 61 i cant seem to figure out how to get each value to print only once with the frequency following it i realize its probably an issue with a loop
student,in the discussion sections is the main focus completing the labs or are we going over other topics as well
student,on the statstestscpp can we include test cases for summarize although i dont assert anything since it would be difficult to do so i just print the output and mentally confirm that its right
student,is there a way to bump a question on piazza bringing it back to the attention of the instructors if for example they havent responded to a question that a student asked a while ago
student,im having a hard time getting all three of my files to upload at the same time i thought that piazza was just broken but maybe im just doing something wrong i add all three wait a min and then hit submit but it still fails to upload at the same time and i get a 00 can anyone help thanks
student,when i run my code using the makefile provided i get an error main maintestin maintestout binsh maintestin no such file or directory maintestintxt is in the directory by the way also despite my statscpp working and my maincpp appearing to return the correct answers the autograder is still not giving me credit for maincpp it compiles but says the output is incorrect i have 11 for the other two sections but the main despite appearing to be correct isnt giving me credit
student,can we assume that extract column will only return integers and doubles or do we need to write code to prevent processing a vector of chars or strings
student,should i just assume that the rme will be met or should i put assert functions throughout my code to look out for this
student,just wondering how detailed our comments need to be before we submit project 1
student,my public test return code is incorrect on the autograder which would mean my output is wrong however when i ran diff there was no difference in output and all the test cases from the instruction sheet seem to match and my test cases pass yes i am using linux through ssh so that shouldnt be the issue what should i do
student,this is the output im getting when i check for differences and im not sure if it means theres no output as in no difference or if thats supposed to be an indication that theres a problem and the files dont match up bash42 diff maintestout maintestoutcorrect 9a10 bash42
student,1do we need to write our uniquename or project 1s name at the start of our maincpp 2do we need to write explanations of what each function doesor just need to write these kind of things on h file which is already existed 3do we need to write explanations in maincpp
student,my summarize function has worked perfectly well until my last test case i used vpushback to insert the values 3 and 15 into my vector when i run this test summarize counts 3 one time and 15 twice however when i put in a code break and debug it step by step it ends up printing the correct values of one occurrence each any idea why i would be getting different outputs here i ask in private because i dont know if its too close to posting code if it would be acceptable i can post to my classmates as well thanks
student,im pretty sure this is the case but just to be sure our final submission for this project is our most recent autograder submission right we dont have to do anything else if were satisfied with the code in our last submission
student,so my program compiles in the caen virtual machine but the output includes the statement warning maintestdatatsv7 has no value for column b it shows up right after reading column b from maintestdatatsv and right before the summary what could be causing this
student,will we lose style points if our line of code is over 80 chars because of a comment explaining what the code is doing without the comment its less than 80 i suppose i could just move the comment
student,when i try to compile in the terminal with the command g ­wall ­werror ­pedantic ­o1 maincpp statscpp p1librarycpp ­o main main from the project description i get the following message main file not recognized file truncated collect2 error ld returned 1 exit status i saw something on piazza about including p1libraryh in the statscpp file but that didnt help what can i do
student,although the mathh library is not included in the list of libraries we are permitted to use i would really like to use floor or fmod which are both in this library are these functions somehow allowed without me having to specifically include the math library if not how can i find out what math operators i have at my disposal
student,i tried submitting my files all 3 at once to the autograder and it grades but says compilation failure for all 3 tests i have been writing my code on sublime and compiling on terminal with no errors using g wall werror pedantic o1 maincpp statscpp p1librarycpp o main why is this leading to a compilation failure on the auto grader i also havent modified any files that were given
student,every time i run my code and get a runtime error xcode likes to just show me the assembly code how do i get it to show me my regular code instead during runtime errors
student,hey so im running the caen linux environment through vnc im going through the machines folders looking for something anything that may be useful do i try to access a command terminal and where do i find what im looking for
student,i added the unsigned to the vsize like the other piazza posts said but im getting an error that says comparison between signed and unsigned integer expressions when i try to compile in caen how do i fix this
student,i downloaded the delimited format of the data from the icpsr website although when i unzipped it i couldnt find a tsv file does anyone know where it is or what im doing wrong
student,is there any way to fix this ive tried clearing history cache using a difference browser and staring at the loading bars with fury if you encountered this problem what worked for you
student,in order to have good style that can be readable are we encouraged to explain every line of code that might confuse the reader i feel like i am adding too many comments and worried that this will shave off some style points usually i have five to seven lines of comments per function is this too much
student,when i go to upload all three files to the autograder only statstestcpp uploads even if i select all three to be put in the queue i can upload each file successfully in individual submissions but i cant seem to upload all three at the same time for some reason status invalid reasons missing file maincpp missing file statscpp files submitted statstestscpp results total score 00 9172015 82912 pm this is what happens
student,using the file of real data ive noticed that the data seems to be parsed erroneously when it comes to data that the codebook refers to as missing all missing data documented in the codebook as a is parsed in as a 0 this wildly throws off our statistical analysis this is not something we have to account for is it
student,my test file compiles in c aen but doesnt in autograder
student,what files are supposed to be included at the top of maincpp is it only iostream p1libraryh and statsh
student,just to make sure im on the right page the statscpp file were writing is solely for the purpose of solving test cases correct the statistical functions used by maincpp are from statsh which is provided by the course staff for us thanks
student,ive looked over the lecture slides and still dont understand is there a simpler way to understand this
student,how many sets of tests do we have to make for minimum
student,the auto grader is stuck on the loading pare after i click on project 1 romance i have tried clearing my cache and history and used a different computer how can i fix this
student,hello the autograder just gave me 33 on my submission does this mean im done for sure i felt that the specification for test cases was a bit strange considering the example the instructor provides does already test every function at least one time do the instructors check anything the autograder does not such as comments and testing
student,i read the specs for testing and im a little confused are we supposed to open the tsv file in the test suite and run a variety of tests or are we supposed to make our own arbitrary datasets in our test suits my test suite compiles in caen but when i submit it to the autograder it says theres a compilation error
student,
student,is the stdev for a vector with only one number just zero
student,i searched piazza for an issue with not being able to open the file and a post said to check the directory how do i do that
student,so i downloaded all of the files that are needed including the tsv file and when i run the first set of data qflag my summarize function only displays the frequency of the 1s and not the frequency of the 2s however all of the other stats are correct including count max stdev and percentiles for the glbstatus set of data my summarize shows both the 0s and the 1s as well as correct stats for everything i was wondering if anyone else was having similar problems or if it was just me
student,should we still put rme statements in front of the stats functions in statscpp or are the explanations in the header file enough
student,do we need to account for the user entering a column name that isnt an option
student,linux is giving me an error saying that extractcolumn and sort are being defined twice when im fairly certain i didnt modify the code this is the error tmpcc9un1v1o in function extractcolumnstdstring stdstring p1librarycpptext0x0 multiple definition of extractcolumnstdstring stdstring tmpccemsfhyostatscpptext0x4f0 first defined here tmpcc9un1v1o in function sortstdvectordouble stdallocatordouble p1librarycpptext0x1100 multiple definition of sortstdvectordouble stdallocatordouble tmpccemsfhyostatscpptext0x1890 first defined here
student,hey prof deorio do you have a tattoo on your left bicep what is the tattoo of also you seem like someone whos always happy so i was wondering is there anything that gets you angry including outside cs thanks
student,for int i 0 i vsize i something like this should become for int i 0 unsigned i vsize i if you dont have an unsinged then a warning shows up and because of the flags we are using it does not let the code compile
student,has anyone been able to find a percentile calculator or something to test our cases against without having to repeat the formula over and over
student,my stats test file is compiling without error im compiling it with statscpp but when i run it i get errors looking like this statstestscpp116 void testnegativedataset assertion modev 987 failed whenever i run what ive compiled i get errors on different lines its random every time ive wrote my test cases like this assertcountv 4 some of the asserts contain ranges ex for standard deviation when necessary
student,what should the standard deviation of a vector be if it only contains 1 value
student,are we supposed to do lab 01 linux
student,i tried to load the auto grader last night and today but it is stuck on loading
student,statstests testsmalldataset pass main maintestin maintestout diff maintestout maintestoutcorrect 4d3 make test error 1 i am getting this can someone explain why it is showing up as an error and what does the 4d3 mean
student,when i cout the median of a vector it prints the correct median but when i assert that the vector the correct median the assertion fails any idea what the problem might be
student,when i try to compile my files i get an error that says no such file ive also tried to use the lab files and it does the same thing for that as well heres the read out from the project files bash42 ls maincpp maintestoutcorrect p1libraryh statstestscpp maintestdatatsv makefile statscpp maintestin p1librarycpp statsh bash42 g wall werror pedantic 01 statstestscpp statscpp p1librarycpp o statstests g error statstests no such file or directory g error unrecognized command line option ‘01’
student,i can run my program on mac but when i run it on caen it shows that sortvbeginvend is wrong when i run the program with maincpp and p1librarycpp together it works but when i just run my statstestscpp on caen it shows wrong how can i fix it
student,should i add comments in my test suite
student,my code compiles in caen with the line g statstestscpp statscpp p1librarycpp o main when submitting to the autograder it says that my cpp files will not compile do the cpp files need be able to compile without linking like g statscpp
student,last year in my eecs 183 class i often stepped in and stepped out of functions to help me with the debugging process i was just wondering if caen had a similar feature thanks
student,is this score for test main total 01 really the only feedback we get for the completion score how are we supposed to know if some small output difference is failing or if its something substantial for example im not sure if a newline at the end of my output is what is giving me a 0 or if the file input needs to be on its own line or if im actually failing a test case for my stats functions im passing all of my test cases so im just at a loss
student,hey so for functions working with vectors especially the summarize function should we look up information on how to sort them the explanation on vectors in the project 1 document and its c link do not have everything needed for that function correct me if im wrong or should we transfer all the values into an array also let me know if these questions are too specific im just not sure how to work with a vector like i do an array thanks
student,i did the project by using visual studio but did not include any specific headers that doesnt run on linux when i submitted the files to autograder it gave me compilation failure
student,i tried last night and today morning i am not able to update my submission at all due to no fault of my own
student,when i run my code in the terminal it keeps getting stopped by this error num variable may be used uninitialized in this function i uninitialize it but then the error remains how do i fix this also how is the output in main graded it fails in the autograder compiles though is it based off of copying the format from the spec or is there a checklist of things and i happen to be missing one of these items
student,both gedit and emacs are extremely annoying to use because pressing enter brings the cursor to the start of the next line and pressing tab doesnt help line up the code correctly can i change settings to make it more user friendly if so how
student,does uofm offer a discountfree license purchase of sublime
student,are deorioss fall 2015 lectures available online if so where can i find them
student,so i realized this while i was creating my percentile function but how can one find the percentile of just one data point is that even possible i tried searching up this unusual case however i got nothing
student,aka student test compilationmainpublic
student,when i submit my project autograder gives me the following response i have no problem running the main test and real data works too wondering whats wrong with my code public test compilation success return code incorrect score for public test total 01
student,my project works when i run it through terminal it outputs all of the correct test data but when i submit it to the auto grader it says there is a compiling error i am writing it through xcode and it says theres a linker error does anyone know how to fix this
student,aside from our name and uniquename do we need any other information comments at the top of our code
student,i dont get the right output for test main does that mean my statstestcpp is incorrect httpsgyazocomcbe920b514d489344c531f2093391b58
student,i submitted my code to the autograder and for both test main and public test my code compiles but for the test student test compilation my code fails it compiles and runs fine on caen and i dont understand why it compiles sometimes but not others is anyone else having a problem like this
student,
student,i downloaded the data from the website and chose delimited then unzipped the file using the command specified in linux are we supposed to have a icpsr30103ds000130103­0001­datatsv file after unzipping i have the icpsr30103 folder and inside i have a ds0001 folder and inside that i have the codebook and questionnaire in pdf form but no tsv file if i try running the program and inputing the filename icpsr30103ds000130103­0001­datatsv i get an error saying error opening icpsr30103ds000130103­0001­datatsv i think this is because i dont have the tsv file how do i get this file
student,ive been returning the percentile functions as double since its called as a double but within the project 1 pdf file one of the examples has 3009 1s and 993 2s and the 25th 50th and 75th percentiles were all 1 should i cast it as an integer then
student,anyone has the same issue thanks
student,after i compile my files in caen it shows me the errors in my program in the terminal then i correct them and compile again then the same errors appear again how do i fix this so i can successfully compile
student,should we write test cases with vectors that hold other variables like int or can we assume that the vector will always be of type double the functions all call vectors of doubles but i just want to make sure thanks
student,everytime i try running it i get this message httpsgyazocoma89711c915ea4b95beb25bdb1ec8776d i think everything is right if i change one of the asserts to something i know is wrong then i get a different error message
student,do we receive an email stating our score from the autograder the reason why im asking is every time i refresh the page after i submit my code the page goes from saying status queued to saying that i have not submitted anything
student,ive been submitting my completed files to the autograder but it keeps saying that they are invalid i submitted maincpp statscpp and statstestscpp but it says that all files are invalid since im missing files what am i doing wrong
student,are we allowed to use break within a loop to break out of a loop if a certain condition is met ive been told it wasnt allowed in eecs 183 so i was wondering if that is the same for eecs 280
student,i am getting test main and test student test compilation correct but a 0 on public test what does this mean
student,i was just wondering how you would go about testing void functions like summarize you cant use assert because you dont return a value so what do i do
student,when i run make test i get many errors even though when i compile all of the code together it compiles fine i also get no differences when i check it also seems like many of the errors that show up when i run make test originate from the p1 library does it still compile its very difficult to wade through all of the error messages
student,do we have to add rms to our stats function this time in the style guide it says to have it but since it is already in the statsh is it necessary to write it again
student,im testing out the data file from the how couples meet and when i test it on my local comp i get this input for my summarize function which is correct its also taking an unusually long time for the standard deviation to compute on my comp in the terminal when i ssh into caen and run the exact same commands using the same file i get this output the summarize function is missing the 2 it for some reason skips the 2 and the standard deviation function works and outputs pretty quickly in comparison to my comp any input as to why this is happening i also got a 33 on autograder so im not sure what the problem might be
student,for the lab 01 we can only use caen linux or we can use something else like ubuntu
student,so i understand that our mode function is supposed to output the smallest number if there are mulitple modes however in the maintestout the mode it output for mode is 6 instead of 1 is this a mistake or is my mode function wrong
student,when i run the diff function to compare my file against the correct output it keeps telling me that there is a difference between my enter a filename and enter a column name and the correct output however the outputs look identical so ive tried adding and removing spaces here and there and new lines etc to see if it makes a difference but i still get the same difference its also saying that my line space between the summarize output and count output is different but theyre both just a new line so im confused on that as well i attached a picture of the output that diff is giving me for reference thanks
student,statscpp119 fatal error statsh no such file or directory include statsh that is what i get from compiling in the terminal i did change directory and those files were all in there i did use makefile so all the cpps should be in the compiler any ideas
student,after opening putty on my computer and typing in logincourseenginumichedu into the host name a command screen come up and says login as ive typed in my mcard number uniquename everything and nothing works whenever i in anything it asks for a password and i try typing something else and it wont let me type at all anyone experiencing this problem will we learn about this in discussion
student,this is a very dumb question i feel but ive been reading what stdout is and i really dont get it in the summarize function can we use cout if not how do we print to stdout could someone give me an example of how you would print to stdout ie print the word hi to stdout
student,at what time on friday is the project due also an ia today mentioned extra points for early submission a la the 183 policy is a policy like that in effect for 280
student,if there is a data set 12233 should the mode function return the lowest of the data set 1 or the lowest of the most frequent numbers 2
student,im using the diff command in the terminal to see why my main output is not correct however i use sdiff to compare each line and its the same as the correct output any way i can fix this
student,can we copy and paste the sort function given to us into our statscpp file and not the header file so it is accessible to the functions in the statscpp file this is because i have read from the other piazza posts that we cannot assume the the vector being passed in is already sorted
student,when we are reading in the tsv file is there function that is provided or do we have to create the function ourselves
student,does the vector need to be sorted before calculating percentile i cant find that it says anywhere but the examples on wikipedia are ordered so im thinking they do need to be ordered first thanks
student,should we call the sort function at the beginning of the percentile function the 0th percentile should be the lowest number and the 100th percentile should be the highest number or the 0th percentile should be the first number in the file and the 100th percentile should be the last number in the file
student,whenever i try to test my code in terminal it compiles but it doesnt run there is no output why is that i entered this into the terminal g ­wall ­werror ­pedantic ­o1 maincpp statscpp p1librarycpp ­o main
student,i saw a few posts on here about people adding more numbers and columns in maintestdatatsv are we supposed to be editing that file i thought only maincpp statscpp and statstests were supposed to be changed
student,i keep getting this error when i try to compile im not sure whats causing it and ive checked that all of my files are on mfile
student,my program has worked for all public test cases and my own test cases but when i test the summarize function using the real data tsv file i have an issue the summarize function works with the glbstatus column but when i use the qflag column my program outputs 1 3009 2 994 instead of 1 3009 2 993 has anyone else come across this issue does this sound like an error in my summarize function
student,when implementing the mean function in statscpp what should we do if computing the mean would result in an error what i mean by that is lets say we are dividing by 0 should we print a message saying undefined or just put the mean equal to 0 also do we have to do anything involving rounding the computed means to either a nearest whole number or certain number of decimal places thanks
student,how do we transfer the maintestdatatsv file to our files in order to use it for testing my only option is to save it as an image
student,in statstestscpp my stdev test is failing however if i manually test it by just calling the function without asserting it returns the correct value this value is the same value i asserted
student,the autograder just does not open it keeps loading and doesnt open the blue circle thing keeps cycling but nothing happens what should i do
student,when i compile my statstestscpp and statscpp to test my functions it outputs the number 3 after my median test while causes the case to fail does anyone know why this 3 is showing up
student,do we need to put a new line at the end of the main function
student,i have a main function in my maincpp file and one in my statstestcpp file how do make it so that i can run without running into an issue of having two main functions
student,is anyone getting errors like these when they try to compile on linux
student,the project spec has all math being done in statscpp and no requirements for the stats function mention v must be sorted but in the spirit of marginally cleanerfaster code is it okay to sort v in maincpp aside the requirements in the header for the statscpp functions are v is not empty or for stdev v has at least 2 elements should we account for this in maincpp as in write checks to verify that we dont pass unqualified vectors to stats function then print an error to the console
student,when writing my code in visual studio i changed the accuracy of my stdev and percentile functions but when i went to compile it in linux the and symbols were unrecognized without an accuracy check like this both vs and linux are throwing accuracy errors is there a way to change the accuracy of my assert in linux without using or if not how should we assert our stdev and percentile functions
student,where are jon juetts office hours from 48pm today the location is not included on the calendar
student,when i try to compile in caen it gives me an error message maincpp482 no newline at end of file any idea why i need a newline
student,when i try to compile my project in terminal i get a long error message ending in linker command failed with exit code 1 use v to see invocation what does this mean
student,is it better style to use atindex or index when using vectors i understand they work slightly differently but is one more correct than the other
student,even though we included statsh in statscpp is it good practiceare we required to still put the function prototypes on the top of our program
student,using sdiff maintestout maintestoutcorrect my percentile output alignment isnt fully to the left eg correct 0th percentile 25th percentile 50th percentile current 0th percentile 25th percentile 50th percentile ive tried ios flags multiple ways as well as setw nothing changes it
student,i keep trying to attach my files to autograder but every time i submit it gives me a 00 and says my files didnt attach
student,my first question is with error messages for rme statements the examples explain several cases where it is required that the vector is not empty are we supposed to in our code check that the vector is not empty with count for example or median and print an error statement if it is in engr101 they told use specific messages we would have to printout for specific errors we might run into with different projects im wondering if we have to do the same thing here is there a chance our code will be tested with an empty vector for example next question relates to mean and stdev precision ive seen the other posts relating to stdev and i understand that for the testcases we need to do something like number stdev stdev othernumber when our code is run is it possible we will be marked off because of precision errors like this i know most people were asking about stdev but i actually ran into a problem with mean in my testcases i had an assert statement that was coming out as failed to assert i checked that i put the right numbers in so that i didnt type a different number to check against by mistake i double checked the calculator then to get a better idea i tried writing a line before the assert statement that was just printing out the value returned from the mean function that i was checking in the assert statement the number printed to the terminal this way was exactly the same as the number i was checking against then i tried something else instead of putting in a number with decimals i tried just writing 80 11 which is exactly what was being done and returned in my mean function i still got an error message my mean function worked fine for all of my other test cases could it have something to do with the fact that the mean is a repeating number i dont know why im still getting an error message but im assuming its similar to the problem with stdev returning to my original question will we get marked off by the autograder for these kind of things so if one of the tests in the autograder was exactly identical to the test i ran and had the mean problem with would the autograder think i have the wrong mean value or stdev value and take points off of my project
student,ive seen conflicting values on what is the accepted margin or error of the result of our functions 267 says that it is 005 while 280 says that it is 001 what is the actual margin of error that the autograder will take into account when grading our functions
student,i know that if you have a mode for a set like 1335677 that the mode would be 3 because when there are multiple numbers tied for mode then it goes to the smallest number however my question is what would be the mode of 1335677 would it be 3 or 7 technically 7 is smaller however it could have been that when dealing with positive numbers it is supposed to be closer to 0 but smaller is easier to describe it
student,i have run my program directing the outputs to an out file and used diff to see that it exactly matches the correct file and it has also passed all the statstests i have written but when i use the autograder it says it fails all three tests and says compilation failure i wrote and tested my function in linux and am using the autograder in linux so why isnt it compiling when i use the autograder
student,are we supposed to get detailed feedback via email through the autograder if so i have not gotten one
student,about the test case given in statstestscpp they already give us a sample test case with 321 do we have to make at least one more or can we use this set to test all functions
student,hello i am having trouble reading data in from a file can anybody help me out with this ive tried using ifstream and fin but these are giving me trouble
student,im trying to use a rangebased forloop and the compiler complains that they are not allowed in c98 mode when i compile with stdc11 however everything works fine do i need to alter my code to work with the supplied compilation process or will the autograder have c11 enabled
student,when using vim to try and open my statstestscpp file i get an e325 saying it found a swap file by this name statstestscppswp it then proceeds to say swap file statstestscppswp already exists then gives me the option of open to read only edit anyways recover delete quit and abort i have no idea what any of that means and what to do i dont want to somehow mess up the statstestscpp please help
student,in maincpp im trying to get extractcolumn to work i read in the filename and column name and use that in the function but it keeps exiting with code 1 my maintestdatatsv is in the same folder and im not really sure which of the type 1 errors im having a problem with anyone have any ideas
student,where can i see a list of all of the discussion times do i need to prepare for these discussions
student,i have completed all code and debug under the situation that the statstestscpp is the original one no any other code and put all the functions in statscpp it works however when i put them into autograder it shows that all of them are failure what is the problem should i copy the code from the statscpp to statstestcpp
student,could we be given a data set with no number occurring twice this would mean the mode is the lowest number right
student,to clarify am i correct in thinking that the lab assignments are completed in discussion sections so we dont have toshouldnt work on them outside our discussion are we allowed to attend any discussion section or just the one were enrolled in thanks
student,how do we handle polymodal data sets and data sets that have no mode eg every number occurs exactly the same number of times the project 1 pdf just picks the lowest number in the set thank you
student,because i was having difficulty understanding the interaction between various files i wrote all of my stats cases as individual functions above my main function in maincpp now im moving them over to statscpp and running into some confusion questions 1 do i need include declarations in my statscpp file 2 what are void summarize and int count in statsh for 3 can i ignore void summarize and int count if they turn out to require me to redesign my frequencyvalue algorithm i have in place in my main function in maincpp basically i have my output looking like what its supposed to im just doing organization now and getting a bit confused
student,would anyone know why in percentile i get an out of bounds exception for the vector when i do vectoratindex but not when i do vectorindex thanks
student,in honor of professor deorios lecture and pbj example this was on the front page of reddit today coincidence i think not httpswwwyoutubecomwatchvurvwssagtje
student,everything runs as it should yet i keep getting this error after the difference is shown make test error 1 anyone bueller
student,to turn in the project do we just submit our final version to the autograder or is there somewhere else we need to turn it in as well
student,i used the diff to test my maincpp there is no output which means the result is completely correct but i still cannot get credit on autograder what could the problem be
student,for the percentile function are we expected to return an integer value that is rounded up im getting the accurate answers with decimals but the output does not match
student,i have seen multiple posts about this but it is unclear to me so i run the files through terminal on my mac and statstestscpp runs and says pass then when i submit to the autograder i get compilation failed is there a specific reason this could be happening i do get error opening file in my maincpp but this shouldnt affect statstestscpp or statscpp right
student,the autograder reported success for the test student test evaluation and public test but says the output in test main is incorrect is this a stats function error or is the autograder looking for specific formstyle of output in main
student,hello i was running a test comparing the maintestout to the maintestoutcorrect and i received this error that i dont understand
student,since statsh has rme for each function already do we really need to write them for statscpp if so do we need to include anything new or just reiterate
student,i have a test with a large stdev around 15000 i am only getting to the hundredth place in the answer i cant see beyond the hundredth so i get an assert error why is this
student,what could be going wrong with my code if it returns error opening maintestdatatsv all i am doing is initializing a vector with the extractcolumn function like the notes say
student,for statstestscpp can we just put all of our test cases into the already given function testsmalldataset or do we have to create a new function
student,for some reason i have been getting assert errors when testing my stdev and mean functions on only a few test cases i am confused because i have the file print what my functions are getting and it is the exact same as what is in my assert statement what can i do to fix this is it just a general issue or are my functions wrong
student,supposing that some of the answers to your test cases are really long decimal values whats the limit on the number of decimal places for the number you are comparing the value returned from your function to also what i tried doing was set a double variable equaled to the long decimal value outputted the value with the precision set to five and compared it to the value that my function returned im not sure if this is the right way to do it is there a better way
student,so im currently writing my statstestcpp i made a vector with a bunch of numbers and when im writing the assert for mean i find the mean to be 5323232323232 and so on how should i properly write the assert for this very long mean
student,seen this in the hotline on piazza and in discussion but have no fear if you are a student that had a caen account automatically created for you and youve had issues logging in ie it kicks you out with no error message when you try to log in the problem is most likely with your ifs storage something went wrong when your account was created go to httpsifsprovisioningitsumicheduifsstorage click request log in and from there you should be able to request storage it takes about a minute to go through pin
student,my main function is just the default cout hello world function but the autograder is giving me compilation failure why might this be
student,ive read the wikipedia page for the percentile function but cannot understand how it works are we supposed to look at the microsoft excel version the examples on the website do not always end up with a number that was one of the inputted numbers is that okay or should the break up for our percentile be one of the numbers from the vectors
student,so what i have heard is that we are supposed to submit at least one test case for each of our functions except summarize so does this mean i should be submitting 7 sets of test cases or one test case that asserts all of them thank you
student,just an fyi for microsoft excel 2013 users there are multiple standard deviations use stdevs rather than stdevp the p is for the populations and is not the corrected standard deviation the s is the corrected form of standard deviation
student,whenever i type my password into putty to log in it says putty fatal error server unexpectedly closed network connection i went to office hours but they didnt know what went wrong does anyone know whats going onhow to fix it
student,i am going through my test cases right now i am getting an error for an assertion for one of the mean values i double checked my calculator and made sure that the answer was right to see if something else was going wrong i made sure that the result of the mean value function for that vector was printed to the terminal before going to the assertion the terminal printed out the exact same number as in the assertion statement yet i got a message saying that the assertion failed i think i have an idea of what might be going wrong but i dont know why the number is a repeating number but it seems to round on the 5th decimal does the problem have something to do with the fact that its a repeating value i know that for stdev we were told to use small bounds for our assertions because even if it was right we would probably get an error message does the same rule apply here for stdev or this would we lose points on our project even though we have the correct numbers
student,i dont really get the debugger im trying to step over to figure out whats wrong and i initialized count to 0 but the debugger says count 32767 what
student,to compile the code the project details says to use g wall werror pedantic 01 with the file names how is this different from g filecpp o file essentially what im asking is what wall werror etc even means and why do we do that compared to what were used to to compile when i compile on terminal in mac the wall werror etc doesnt even work
student,whenever i try to run the first simple test by typing g ­wall ­werror ­pedantic ­o1 stats­testscpp statscpp p1librarycpp ­o stats­tests in the terminal i am greeted with these errors clang error no such file or directory ­wall clang error no such file or directory ­werror clang error no such file or directory ­pedantic clang error no such file or directory ­o1 clang error no such file or directory stats­testscpp clang error no such file or directory statscpp clang error no such file or directory p1librarycpp clang error no such file or directory ­o clang error no such file or directory stats­tests clang error no input files why is this happening thank you in advance
student,are we allowed to change the function signatures in the projects for project 1 i would like to use dependency injection to test the summarize function however im not sure how the autograder will respond to that additionally do the restrictions on what can be included apply to the test class as well as the production code
student,do we need to upload all the files in project 1 to mfiles and then use g wall werror 01 pedantic g maincpp p1librarycpp statscpp o program to test whether the code works in caen environment
student,currently when i compare my maintestout and maintestoutcorrect using both sdiff and diff i find no differences in output however the autograder is still reporting failure for all tests im not sure what could be causing this error and am looking for insight
student,am i supposed to call the extract function and the sort function in main before i call all of the functions that i have written so each of the functions i am writing should have a vector v input that is organized from lowest value to highest or do each of my functions have to call sort themselves
student,i dont understand how to calculate the 0th 25th 50th and 100th percentage anyone can help
student,do we need to submit a test case for the summarize function in statstestscpp i tested the function on my own by just calling it and looking at the output however i am not sure if the autograder wants us to write a test case for this function if so can you use assert to test it thanks
student,since the code is dealing with responsesanswers to a survey from people can we assume that there will never be negative numbers in the vector
student,does the summary function have to output numbers in ascending order
student,for the below vector when i cout the sum it reads 15796 but when i use assert it tell me that assertion failed i tried debugging this and it seems that the sum has a value of 1579599999999999 which does not equal 15796 exactly is their a way to fix this repeating number since the sum should be an exact number vectordouble p ppushback225 ppushback124 ppushback180 ppushback18 ppushback2495 ppushback1364 ppushback85 ppushback901 assertsump 15796
student,im sorry but im having trouble finding this data 1 i go to this website 2 i click on delimited 3 it downloads a 31 mb file 4 i unzip through winrar 5 i open icpsr30103 ds0001 6 in it i see no tsv file but just the cookbookpdf and questionnairepdf
student,i may have missed something but is the autograder there for us to gauge the performance of our code and then make changes to it or is autograder there for us to turn in our files for a grade what i mean is is autograder meant to help us check if our code is on progress or is just a place to submit our final code for a grade thanks
student,to how many decimal points does our standard deviation value need to be correct compared to the accepted value for example my stdev function is giving me a value of 129099 and the accepted value is 1290994449 is this considered accurate enough im currently checking accuracy by ensuring the difference between my calculated value and the accepted value is an extremely small number ie 00000000001 obtained from previous piazza post is it adequate to use a value such as 0000001 instead
student,in order to pass a vector as an argument in my test functions should i pass by reference and have the return type be void or can i return a vector from a function
student,i read the other thread on this but im still a little confused about how we should be testing the summarize function do we create our own correct output files and compare that to the produced output file
student,in statstestcpp should we be using assert to test the summarize function or simply calling it and manually assessing its correctness if we are supposed to use assert how do you use assert with strings
student,do we need to add rmes for functions we wrote to test count mean mode etc
student,so for the autograder i am failing the test main part of it even though my output on caen is correct does anyone know what the test main is so i can check why i am failing it
student,for the summarize function i know we want to cout each number that appears along with its frequency but should the line summary value frequency appear in the summarize function or just main thanks
student,so is project 1 only worth 3 points i submitted my files to the auto grader and got 33 so does that mean im done with the project or is that only the compilation score and ill get the rest of my score later
student,i didnt touch any of the code given to me yet i am having errors whilst the compiler builds the code anyone else having this problem
student,when p1 the its just out of bound for the example in wiki using the formula given with p1 n5 and it would be asking for the value of v6 which does not exist so is it okay we just make a if statement for p1
student,i opened the page for autograder using linux system there is nothing there just a blank page
student,i know that the tests will only run the 0th25th50th75th100th percentiles but should we assume our code can only do that make a bunch of if statements or assume that it can do any percentile between 01
student,i wont say where but in one of my functions i use the implicit rounding down of numbers in converting from doubles to ints as an unspoken step in my code is this going to cost me style points or is it ok
student,should we have the rmes in statscpp as well as statsh or can we not include them since theyre already in statsh
student,i am familiar with using visual studio so this g caen stuff is extremely new to me and also very confusing i have been looking for office hours times and places and cannot find anything where and when are office hours because i am very lost thank you kyle
student,when submitting to the autograder is it reading in the tsv file found on google docs or is it reading in the actual data from the hcmst study
student,from a grading standpoint is it expected that for projects we will have comments in our code aside from name date etc at the top of the file or is it acceptable to write selfdocumenting code eg use verbose variable and function names that would make comments redundantunnecessary
student,when p 1 is the returned percentile the last number in the vector because otherwise applying the formula gives an out of bounds error
student,the way im reading the instructions write tests for your functions in the statstestcpp file write as many or few test cases as you want this statstestscpp file is more for your benefit to get used to testing we only grade for the presence of test cases we dont look too closely at the test cases themselves but trust us youll want to get used to writing solid test cases while the project material is relatively easy am i understanding correctly or am i off the mark somewhere thanks
student,i downloaded the folder and i cannot find the tsv file
student,when i add some things on column b or add a new column column c it shows that error column name bc not found in maintestdatatsv even i just add a new column column c i cant extract data from column bwhich no change is made whatever i change i cant extract data whats wrong
student,i saw other people posting about linker errors but i am receiving a different one than the previous ones posted ld 1 duplicate symbol for architecture x8664 clang error linker command failed with exit code 1 use v to see invocation
student,i am following the project 1 pdf for directions it says we can click on delimited from httpwwwicpsrumicheduicpsrwebicpsrstudies30103q30103 and download and use icpsr30103ds000130103­0001­datatsv however i unzipped the folder and this file is not located in the download it is mentioned in the file 30103manifesttxt however i am not sure how to access it did i mess up on a step how can i proceed
student,so whenever i try to open up the autograder i am able to select a class but i cannot submit any files as soon as it is open there is nothing on the page this happens both when i remote access the caen network and when i use my browser on my regular computer any idea why this is the case
student,when i navigate to the autograder from ctools it shows the spinning wheel of death and never loads im not using a caen computer if that matters is it downbusy or am i doing something wrong thanks
student,just wander the autograder is up yet
student,if the rmes state that the vector must be nonempty do we need to include code within those functions that checks for that condition if so can we create a new function potentially modifying the header file to include this function which would be implemented in statscpp that checks whether the vector is empty if the vector is empty do we then return something generic eg 0
student,error column name b not found in maintestdatatsv whats wrong i just add some more numbers in column b
student,i just finished writing statsh and it passed all my tests in statstestscpp then i went to write statscpp and couldnt figure out what the point of it is i realized i was supposed to write the actual functions there but instead i wrote the math for them all in the header file so my question is if its possible to write all the math in the header file why dont we just do that include the header file in main and eliminate statscpp thanks
student,im looking through the eecs 280 f15 caen lecture recordings and im trying to figure out which lecture corresponds to each 280x lecture the recordings are only titled by date and the 982015 lecture is a whole lot of nothing and ends with a bit of arch 552 lecture are these the videos i should be watching any help would be much appreciated thanks
student,when calculating the mean it works when i divide the sum by n1 instead of n can someone explain why this is
student,how do we sign up for office hours
student,i submitted code last night and it has been queued this entire time what do i do to fix this
student,i just want to make sure it says in the specs that these are the only libraries we are allowed to use include statsh include p1libraryh include iostream include string include vector include cassert include cmath include iomanip my question is we can use all of these in statscpp in addition to maincpp right
student,im trying to test multiple cases but when i compile it shows only the first case being tested even though i have multiple functions with test cases bash42 program testsmalldataset pass shouldnt it read for multiple test cases bash42 program testsmalldataset pass testsmalldataset2 pass
student,hello when i ran make statstests from makefile and then ran the output statstests i saw this testsmalldataset and nothing else no error message just a blinking cursor
student,what does segmentation fault mean im testing my stdev function but i keep getting that error
student,does it matter what we use on project 1 c or python
student,when i compile the statstestcpp everything passes except for the mode function i am getting program statstestscpp51 void testsmalldataset assertion modev 1 failed aborted does this mean my condition when the frequencies are the same you must take lowest value number is incorrect or is it another problem
student,i am trying to open the calendar on ctools but all it shows me is a blank screen was the calendar closed is there any other way to access it
student,hi i submitted my files to the autograder and they have been queued for grading for nearly 25 minutes so far i wouldnt expect so many submissions at this hour so early in the week so—unless i am incorrect—im assuming this is some sort of glitch ive refreshed the page many times and nothing changes also when i try to submit new files i cannot due to my current files marked as still processing heres a screenshot of whats happening any ideas thanks
student,for median and mode if there are ties do we do the least value
student,i cannot even submit three cpp files every time i submit these the autograder reports three invalid submissions saying each of files is missing i dont know why
student,my autograder score was 33 but after adding some test cases and comments and the autograder maintinence the program will still compile using g on caen and work fine but when i submit to the autograder i get compilation errors for all three cases or an error after the first case is this a problem with the autograder or is it my code
student,after i successfully compiled once im not able to keep compiling
student,is the max score we can get on this autograder a 33
student,the autograder makes me very confused i am getting compilation failures in autograder while the caen results are perfect here are the screenshots
student,do our testcases need to be able to handle decimals or negatives in vector v i ask this bc this is data and it is not like people can say they are halfin a relationship in the survey
student,i assume the public test is the test program used to test our statscpp provided by the instructors so if that doesnt compile does it mean its a problem with my statscpp
student,i do not understand the point of maintestin are we supposed to read the data from maintestin in our maincpp in order to find out the file name and column if so how do we do this since the extractcolumn function can only extract data from a tsv function or do we just manually put in the file name and column name in our maincpp thanks
student,so i believe my percentile function is working properly however i am not sure which program we should code in the cout line of 0th percentile 25th percentile etc right now i have it coded into my statscpp file so that it always appears with just a call to the function ie cout percentilevector 00 would output 0th percentile however when i run assert tests it shows something like 50th percentile pass because all of the tests passed but i have the percentile function outputting the percentile to the screen is this wrong and if so how should i change it thanks
student,after you prompt the user for a filename are you supposed to read that file im having trouble doing this like if the user says maintestdatatsv should you do something along the lines of fileopenmaintestdatatsv thanks
student,the rme for the percentile function states that p must be 0 to 1 inclusive when we do our test cases what should be the output regarding a case where p is no inclusive if we do need a conditional statement what should the output be
student,i have completed my cpp file which works on visual studio but it couldnt run on the autograder i opened the terminal on linux but have completely no idea how to proceed on is there some tutorial so that i can learn how to code in linux thank you
student,i know were given cmath in maincpp and statscpp but are we also allowed to use it in statstestscpp

student,when we create our custom test cases on statstestscpp should we assume vectors are sorted beforehand i use the sort function in my maincpp file before any stats functions are implemented i do not use the sort function within my statscpp file because the spec does not permit us to use the library algorithm for that file if i rely on the vectors being sorted only within the maincpp file will i need to worry about running into test cases where the vectors are not sorted when only statscpp is being tested thanks
student,if we are required to always print out the 0255075 and 100th percentiles what is the function of the double p passed into this function thanks
student,when i am testing my code for project one my standard deviation function prints the correct answer for standard deviation which is 158114 for one of my tests but when i use assert it says that it fails do i need to truncate my answers to a certain number of digits
student,im getting an error in diff when trying to check maintestout and maintestoutcorrect against each other but the outputs match exactly is there an explanation for this
student,something strange is happening with my sum function and i dont know why i created a test case for my sum function with doubles and negative numbers and the assert concluded that the functions answer matched up with the correct answer i created another test case for my sum function again with doubles and negative numbers only using different numbers but for some reason the assertion failed i even used cout to print the number my function is giving me and it matched up exactly with the correct value i used for the assert im puzzled as to what could be cause one test case to work but the other to fail
student,im getting a segmentation fault error right after i input the files and columns does anyone know what could have caused it
student,when we use size to get the number of items in a vector what datatype does it return
student,ok so i got this error when i tried to compile on xcode undefined symbols for architecture x8664 extractcolumnstd1basicstringchar std1chartraitschar std1allocatorchar std1basicstringchar std1chartraitschar std1allocatorchar referenced from main in maino ld symbols not found for architecture x8664 clang error linker command failed with exit code 1 use v to see invocation i got this after trying to do a function call in main
student,for example in summarize in statscpp i want to use the sort function to sort all the numbers out from least to greatest before i start counting the frequency how do i call the sort function im not sure what to put in the parameter which is what im curious about
student,if a vector that is passed in is filled with lets say characters do we need to cout an error message saying the vector needs to consist of numbers the only requirements for some of the functions state the vector must not be empty but they dont mention anything about different types of vectors any help would be appreciated
student,when i try to compile my code as instructed on the project specs i get this how can i fix this
student,i know a previous post said never to add include cpp to anything but i did included cpp in one of my files and it compiled and ran on my personal linux compiler but when i removed the include cpp it gave me a bunch of undefined reference to the vector functions like min max stdev etc i posted a followup for this too hehe both times it didnt compile when i submitted the files to the autograder
student,ive included an if statement to check that the vector is not empty but if it is what are we supposed to do do we need an else statement for that
student,for the functions i write i tested all of them by pluging a big vector and see whether the number they give me is correct they all worked well then i used statstest to test it this error pops out for all of my functions statscpp in function ‘void summarizestdvector’ statscpp1528 error comparison between signed and unsigned integer expressions werrorsigncompare forint i 0i vsizei what is this i m just comparing the vsize to the int i in the loop i m sure there is nothing about the sign what happened
student,im trying to use the sort function but im getting this error am i using the function wrong or could it possibly be im missing something this is what i keep getting statscpp831 error expected constructor destructor or type conversion before ‘’ token sort stdvectordouble v
student,on statscpp do we include maincpp because if i dont it gives me an error on the terminal however when i do include it every single time i run statscpp it runs maincpp as well i dont know if this makes any sense but any help would be appreciated
student,still cant access autograder from inside linux can from chrome outside linux but not from firefox inside error encountered the browser you are using does not support web storage please try again in a different browser
student,i write the function for the median using the function sort now i just wanna test this media function how should i compile it
student,for maincpp i dont understand how we extract the filename and column name from maintestin when we are not allowed to use the include fstream thanks
student,i dont understand why i am getting this error statscpp219 error ‘cout’ was not declared in this scope cout im using include iostream
student,we have int main in statstestscpp for testing however we must have a file maincpp which actually runs the program in terms of getting the desired output for the user here which is where i am having difficulty is where we would implement a second main function my question how do we implement a second main function and not get errors do we simply not link the two files statstestscpp and maincpp as in will the autograder keep these separate
student,hello in the maintestoutcorrect file there is an ambiguous space between the summarize functions output and the count functions output could i cout an arbitrary space and expect the maintestout to match the maintestoutcorrect for example summarizev cout endl countv
student,when i log into mfiles it says im missing home directory how do i correct this
student,im having some frustration with the autograder before today my submissions were working but now the grader is saying the time limit is exceeded now whenever i attempt to make a submission the grader crashes my browser i tried a different browser and it just refuses to accept my submission is there any way around this my code compiles and works fine both in visual studio and the caen g compiler
student,im a little confused about the maintestdatatsv are we supposed to put these data into a vector also what exactly are the a and b columns
student,i was wondering if it is secure to upload my files directly in mfile because ive been seeing posts regarding privatepublic files in mfiles and im thinking whether i uploaded my files to public database i was a little confused about grading i mean if our project works perfectly in the auto grader does that mean that weve gotten a 100 also should we write our name unique name or anything else to identify ourselves in the files because i dont see a format anywhere in the specs regarding this thanks
student,did the autograder change after maintenance last night before maintenance i was getting exceeds time limit errors but now the autograder is giving me 33 the weird thing is i didnt change a single line of code from before maintenance to now should i assume that my project is relatively fine or i got lucky
student,chances are that its already been asked pin
student,so i see that it gives a vector out so can i just set some random vector and equate it the extractcolumn function thanks
student,how may test cases should we have per function in order to receive full credit whats a reasonable amount of test cases to have
student,is stdout the same as cout and in statsh for count does numbers in v mean just the unique numbers or does it include the frequency of each unique number
student,i logged into the submission website and theres nothing there is there anything wrong
student,im testing my standard deviation function with various test cases i have it print out my standard deviation number and it comes out as expected but the assertion fails anyone know what to do
student,when there are several numbers that are tied for mode do we return the smallest number in the vector regardless of frequency or the smallest number that is tied for the mode
student,are we outputing the smallest mode whenseveral numbers have the same frequency
student,do we lose points if the method we use to write the functions is overly complicatedinefficient if it still works at the end
student,i was trying to use sort function provided i downloaded p1libraryh and p1librarycpp and put them into the same folder as the program i m coding when i try to compile this function this pops out tmpccaptqmlo in function main goodcpptext0x125 undefined reference to sortstdvectordouble stdallocator collect2 error ld returned 1 exit status what happened
student,i am struggling with the mode i dont understand how it is calculated i saw the example in statsh but didnt make sense to me could i get any help
student,does the count of numbers in the vector mean how many different numbers it have or the total number for the count function
student,ive read the piazza posts the header file yet i am still really stumped on this one is it necessary to use loops here
student,is there an easierfaster way to upload files onto mfiles
student,for these functions for example for percentile it says requires v is not empty p is between 0 and 1 inclusive does this mean the values entered will always fit these specifications or do we need to test for improper values thanks
student,after entering the file name and column im unable to open the file and i get an error stating error opening maintestdatatsv these are my headers including in my maincpp include p1libraryh include statsh include iostream include vector include string im using xcode and ive included the file in the same directory as the xcodeproj and the folder that contains all the other files as well thanks
student,i read the spec and looked at all the examples but i am rather lost i understand that we should begin by writing unit tests but i dont know how to go about that my only programming experience was in engineering 101 where all of our testing was done by the autograder if anyone can give me some basic fundamentals of writing test cases or point me to documentation online i would appreciate it
student,i just dont really get why we need the caen account why cant we just use x code and what does the autograder have to do with caen thanks
student,to find the last element of a vector can you do say v1 or is that a python thing
student,are structs considered global variables in general could we use them for establishing our custom vector
student,okay so i read the instructions and stuff but i still dont understand anything about this course and how to write code and project 1 is due in like 6 days and im panicking hard o can someone help me out please like i see type g ­wall ­werror ­o1 ­pedantic ­g filename1cpp filename2cpp to compile but like where do you type this and wha brain explodes please help me
student,im incredibly confused on how we are supposed to work with the following line of code when writing new test cases below is the line from the given sample test case in statstestscpp v123 assertpercentilev 05 2 what is this calculating the 50th percentile so does this not calculate the 2575th percentiles and if so how would we know if our program got it right also how do we calculate the the 2575th percentiles by hand for the test cases thanks
student,i followed the instructions on httpwwwitcsumicheduitcsdocss4386 to get started but i dont know what to put in for the host name when starting putty any help im really confused rn
student,may seem like a stupid question but does the sort function sort the function from least to greatest
student,after uploading the project files via mfile and sshing into caen from my mac i navigate to the folder where i have the project files then i try compiling with this g ­wall ­werror ­pedantic ­o1 stats­testscpp statscpp p1librarycpp ­o stats­tests in response to this i get an error that im having trouble making sense of g error ­wall no such file or directory g error ­werror no such file or directory g error ­pedantic no such file or directory g error ­o1 no such file or directory g error stats­testscpp no such file or directory g error ­o no such file or directory g error stats­tests no such file or directory am i missing a step thanks
student,hi ive looked at other posts on here but i cant seem to find how to use the p1librarycpp file i put include p1libraryh at the top of my stats file will this run automatically and return column data or do i need to call it somehow also will i need a main function in the stats file or just a list of functions thank you
student,my xcode just couldnt run it showed like this
student,for the output of the percentile function in maincpp are we supposed to always just output 0th 25th 50th 75th and 100th percentile also when outputting those percentiles how do i get my output to be aligned nicely as shown in the project specs
student,so i was trying putty and created a file using vim i wrote a few lines of code in it but when i wanted to exit and type q enter it gave me e37 no write since last change add to override what does this mean and how should i fix it
student,ive read the directions multiple times but its still a bit unclear to me i feel like i know how i want to write my code but i dont have a completely clear understanding of what im supposed to do with each file my understanding so far is this maincppthis is the main file or function rather which does everything that we want to get done it calls statistic functions but does not contain them in its own file statscppthis is where all of our statistic functions go there is no int main in this file or any main function this file is a series of statistical functions that are called upon by the main function to compute statistics in engr 101 these functions normally went in with the main file but were just not contained in int main the only difference here is that the side functions are being put into another file statstestscppthis is for testing and nothing else this file does not contain input to be tested in statscpp this file works a bit more like another main file that tests statscpp int main in this file initialize different functions that are to test all of statscpp for different data sets in the example file provided the testsmalldataset function was used it made a basic vector which can be as large or small as we like and it can contain anything we like in the vector the functions from statscpp would then get called to see if they work properly for these vectors we use the assert function as seen in the example to test this if it works then we can trust that all of our functions from statscpp will work just as well for maincpp assuming our testing was good and sufficient clarification we are not making any kind of a file to test maincpp there are files provided to use to check but the tests we are supposed to make and submit are only relevant to statscpp and not maincpp please let me know if any of this was incorrect i just want to make sure that i fully understand the instructions before really diving into the project because this is new compared to what we would do in engr 101
student,what do we write for the remotepath option in sublime text 2

student,does anyone know why i have a bunch of red colored files on the left side on xcode it is also giving me an error when i call sort saying that there is no function definition for that even though it was already written in p1library the error says lexical or preprocessor issue p1libraryh file not found thanks
student,i have a silly question i have posted all three files on my autograder but it showed that there were still two missing files it looked like this
student,on the syllabus it said do not post project code but i am getting this error on this one line of code i was wondering if i can post this here to get help
student,hi ive downloaded the icpsr30103zip from icpsr by clicking delimited and unzipped the file on linux however i cant find the 30103001datatsv in ds0001 folder there are only two pdf files and my program shows an error opening the 30103­0001­datatsv file how do you guys download data
student,hello all when i want to open the autograder from ctools it says that you are not enrolled in any courses does anyone have this problem too or any suggestions thank you very much
student,hello i am having a hard time figuring out the summarize function i can imagine that if a data file contained thousands of unique numbers then i would have to list out every unique numbers frequency so far i have the idea of making the first element in a vector equal to some value then i would check every other value however many times that the first element is equal to another element is the first elements frequency then i would go on to the second frequency and so forth i would get a vector of frequencies am i going in the right direction
student,hello while trying to open the icpsr actual data file i could not find it in the unzipped file in the ds0001 folder was solely contained the 301030001codebookpdf and the 301030001questionnairepdf file thanks
student,1my visual studio 2015 doesnt even seem to compile hello world my guess is that this may have something to do with creating new projects in vs 2015 all the new projects created under version 2015 seem to have this problem while the old projects i created using vs 2013 are still running properly 2 error and screenshot are attached severity code description project file line error lnk2019 unresolved external symbol winmain16 referenced in function int cdecl invokemainvoid invokemainyahxz romance cusershkjlaeecs280projectproject1romanceromanceromancemsvcrtdlibexewinmainobj 1
student,is there a way to get tutoring over the weekend
student,is maincpp just the implementation of our stats functions or is there more we must add
student,ive read the info on wikipedia and got some ideas of p but not much also do we need to print out some thing like 0th 25th 50th 100th every time or depends on p value any idea
student,when i do extractcolumnmaintestdatatsv b i am getting error opening maintestdatatsv what are common reasons for getting this error
student,i was wondering it there is a better way to test output from stdev currently i cannot get the assert to pass since the sqrt16 repeating isnt exactly terminating is there a certain number of decimal places such that sqrt166666666666666 129
student,is it allowed to use pow from cmath library
student,do we have to use nested loops in this function i was able to come up with a solution that has one loop and nested ifelse statements will i get points taken off on the final grade even if i come up with correct solutions
student,i was testing out to see how my functions worked including to ensure what was being stored in the vector that holds the data from the file being read in was correct however my program is reading in every line except the last one this therefore has been throwing off my other functions i thought that the reading in of the file was done using p1library though so im not sure why would i be having this problem thanks
student,how many times per day can we submit to autograder i cant seem to find that information anywhere
student,i am not able to compile my code because i keep getting an undefined reference to the sort function i have a header to include p1libraryh at the top of the statscpp file and am trying to compiling using g wall werror o1 pedantic g statscpp statstestscpp o test i am trying to call the sort function with sortv however it gives me an undefined reference error every time i call it if someone can help me that would be awesome thank you
student,so my program compiles runs perfectly fine in caen linux it terminates and gives the same output for both the test case we were given and also the data we are to download from the study it also runs and terminates for the statstestscpp when i submit it to the autograder it compiles but it takes about 3 minutes before it tells me i exceeded the time limit and was terminated i so i at first wasnt worried about optimization so i went through my code to try to make it run faster i have 2 nested loops one in the summarize and the other in mode i at first thought i was calling sort too much so i commented it out and only called it in the main function before since its a pass by reference that didnt work i went to office hours today in the bbb and he told me to make a post on here explaining all this i am sure my loops are not infinite i checked thoroughly and the gsi didnt see anything abnormal on his quick inspection
student,can we use magic numbers for the percentiles p or should each of those be set as a variable or constant
student,ive compiled and ran my cpp files on caen linux environment but when submitting the files to the autograder i get test student test compilation failure is there anyway i can see the stack trace to figure out what the problem is
student,should we generate any error message or flag if the input is incorrect some function summaries specify that the function will not work if the vector input is empty how should we treat test cases where it is empty thanks
student,do we need to test our summarize function from statscpp in our statstestscpp
student,can we copy the rmes from the statsh and paste them in our statsccp since they are pretty much the same
student,if we decide to use visual studio just to codenot compile is there a link to renew my visual studio expired after i took eecs183 thanks
student,hey there when i try to get into caen using ssh using the directions in the note how to ssh to caen using macs i get this message warning possible dns spoofing detected the ecdsa host key for logincourseenginumichedu has changed and the key for the corresponding ip address 1412137456 is unknown this could either mean that dns spoofing is happening or the ip address for the host and its host key have changed at the same time warning remote host identification has changed it is possible that someone is doing something nasty someone could be eavesdropping on you right now maninthemiddle attack it is also possible that a host key has just been changed the fingerprint for the ecdsa key sent by the remote host is sha256f3ix1o0pajilyptnudr4xozsyjivxw3stomh2hyq please contact your system administrator add correct host key in userssakethsshknownhosts to get rid of this message offending ecdsa key in userssakethsshknownhosts5 ecdsa host key for logincourseenginumichedu has changed and you have requested strict checking host key verification failed i am sure this is because i rebooted my computer since sshing last time how do i go about fixing this thank you
student,the instruction says there are files we can download from google drive but i cannot find it
student,i wasnt able to make the first lecture becuase of a class conflict but i cant find the lecture online and was wondering if i just cant find it or it hasent been posted yet
student,the project instructions say that we are provided with statscpp but i dont see this in the google drive project 1 folder is it somewhere else
student,ive never used the caen computers before this course but i cant find where to make the machine run in linux these are the computers in the caen labs when i sign in it boots to windows the quick reference says to reboot to linux but i dont know where that option is located on the computer any help would be appreciated
student,are there any opinions on using sublime to sftp to caen and back are there any downsides to this compared to using ssh and an editor on caen itself
student,hi i see that void testsmalldataset is a free test case that is given to us when we turn in the project finished should we have left the values in that vector the same and written our own test cases following that or is it okay if we have changed it slightly should we turn it in with all of our test cases written out thanks
student,i tried to access the autograder via safari chrome and internet explorer but none of these could open the site
student,can someone help clarify what this function does iv looked through the clarifying comments pasted below multiple times but am not finding it very clear requires v is not empty p is between 0 and 1 inclusive effects returns the percentile p of the numbers in v like microsoft excel httpenwikipediaorgwikipercentiledefinitionofthemicrosoftexcelmethod note the definition in the wiki article uses indexing from 1 you will need to adapt it to use indexing from 0 double percentilestdvectordouble v double p
student,
student,i get the flow of the functions in statsh but i still dont quite understand how the vectors work for example do we have to fill the vectors before we code the body which provides our desired output the vectors are the input for each function however when trying to implement loops or if statements it says the variable in the function call v is undefined
student,will we be expected to accommodatecompute raw data with decimals in any of the functions other than mean standard deviation and percentile thanks
student,lets say i have a file called blahcpp after compiling it in terminal and running it again by typing in blahcpp i get an error that says permission denied does anyone know why its doing this
student,what should the tolerance be i looked at the specs and all the examples had different decimal places 158114 0431979 and 04263
student,ive never used linux to code before and i have never coded on a caen computer what programcompiler am i looking for on the caen computer
student,are we allowed to use fstream for this project in the project spec it is not in the allowed list of libraries but how else are we supposed to read in files thanks
student,in the program spec theres a function called double modevectordouble v assuming the vector contain numbers 10 10 20 20 20 10 what would be the mode thank you
student,where is the autograder exactly i get that it has to do with caen but i thought caen was just the linux os
student,hi where do we go for office hours are we supposed to sign up in advance
student,do we need to use the maintestin file i realize that it is used to cut the input time like putting in the name of the file and column manually but is it absolutely necessary if i am misinterpreting the use of maintestin file can someone explain what it exactly is for then also if used is it used only through the command line used in the linux environment
student,how would we go about using assert to check doubles that have many decimals for example how do you check that standard deviation is 243148 with probably many more decimals not included
student,if i created a function in statstestscpp would i write the rme above the definition of the function
student,i downloaded the files from the study website but could not find the tsv file where can i find this
student,i didnt see them on the calendar but i just wanted to double check are there any office hours on weekends
student,error executable doesnt exist usersemmaaboukasmdocumentseecs 280 project 1project 1 romanceproject 1 romancederiveddataproject 1 romancebuildproductsdebugproject 1 romance error failed to launch usersemmaaboukasmdocumentseecs 280 project 1project 1 romanceproject 1 romancederiveddataproject 1 romancebuildproductsdebugproject 1 romance thanks so much
student,if there is no specified location on the calendar are oh in the ugli
student,how can we test the summarize method programmatically if it is printing the result out to stdout
student,hi i started project 1 following the instruction how to ssh to caen using mac i havent used caen before and i really do not know what to do next the instruction says follow the compilation instructions for project 1 but i got this message bash42 g stats­testscpp statscpp p1librarycpp ­o stats­tests g error stats­testscpp no such file or directory thanks for help
student,i have been experiencing an issue where when i try logging into linux through the caen vnc the program crashes i am able to log onto caen computers though does anyone know what my problem may be i am running windows 10 64 bit but i also encountered this problem when i was using a caen computer as well
student,im considering developing my code in a linux virtualbox running on my windows laptop because virtually accessing caen is slow is there any reason why this is a bad idea or wont work thanks
student,hello i am confused about the difference in what we are supposed to write in statstestscpp and statscpp i understand one is for writing the tests and the other is for implementing them but then what do we do in maincpp thanks
student,does the autograder give us p1librarycpp i used include p1librarycpp in my main function and i am able to compile in the caen environment but i get a compilation failure when using the autograder any suggestions
student,where are oh posted for profs and gsis
student,i plan on keeping all my code for projects on github how long after the due date of the project should i wait before making the repositories public is there an official policy
student,all students enrolled in 280 where given caen accounts plus if youre an engineer youve always had one you should have received an email stating this you can access caen by logging into a caen computer same username and password as normal or you can remote access from windows mac and linux if you have issues logging in you can contact the caen hotline please have your uniqname ready caen hotline 8am10pm mondaythursday 8am 5pm fridays and sunday noon 5pm live chat email caenumichedu walk in or call 734 764caen 2236 for general information about caen and what it is check out out knowledge base and search
student,ive only seen posts about coding in linux or windows as the spec assumes youre running on linux can we or can we not use xcode
student,for project 1 when we are creating the summary of the data file can we use the function sort or must we create our own sorting algorithm thank you
student,when i try to use the autograder i submit all 3 files at the same time but it give me 3 different messages saying that its invalid because its missing the other 2 files am i doing something wrong
student,my computer runs windows 10 64 bit i downloaded and am running xming enabled x11 forwarding at the display location localhost00 and used the hostname loginenginumichedu when it runs it asks me for my username which i put in and then asks me for my password but doesnt allow me to type anything in at that point anyone else having the same problem
student,hello so this might be a stupid question but im just confused about what maintestin and maintestout do and what their purpose is in the first project thanks
student,in the first project there is sample code for how to use the vector data structure i basically copied all the code and tried to compile but i got the error error comparison between signed and unsigned integer expressions werrorsigncompare however im using my own linux so maybe thats the problem
student,in our statscpp file do we need to check if the vector we are taking as input is empty in statsh it repeatedly says that vector v cannot be empty but the project spec does not say what to do if it is
student,i have linux on my laptop so i was thinking of just compiling and running programs on my own terminal but should i still use the caen linux environment is there a noticeable difference between my own linux environment and the caen one
student,this will probably be covered in class but im looking to get started would it considered bad practice in this class to use namespace std using stdcin and stdcout instead or does it not matter at this point
student,newbie so not really understand how to use caen any explanation
student,i navigated to afsumicheduuser using putty on my windows computer and then i further proceeded to the first to letter of my username however when i use ls it lists many usernames starting with the first two letters as mine however mine is missing i tried using mkdir but its read only is there something else i should be doing or somewhere else i should be saving project files
student,are we allowed to attend any discussion section like the lectures if so is there somewhere where i can see all the discussions available
student,what compiler do you recommend for a windows computer i used visual studio 2013 last year but the trial period expired
student,i was not planning to attend my registered lecture as i know they are all recorded online if i am not there for the first week in person i wouldnt be dropped from the class would i
student,so since project 1 is already out id like to get started however it states in the syllabus that we should use the platform through the caen linux environment is it possible to connect it through virtual sites im trying to open the link loginlinuxenginumichedu but the page is unavailable
student,hello the first announcement mentioned that we would need a caen computer account for this class do we have to request that or is that just the same thing as the computers from virtualsitesumichedu
student,hi do we have discussions the first week of class
student,hi sorry if this is a silly question but where can i find project 1 i looked around on ctools but didnt see it thanks
